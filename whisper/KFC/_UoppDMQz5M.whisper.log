[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.780]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.940]   Today is a special moment for me.
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.760]   This is my first time preaching at KFC, my own spiritual home.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.780]   But this could be the last time and the only time if I'm doing a poor job tonight.
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.760]   So I would like to take one minute of your time just to share a few words from my heart
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.600]   first before my sermon.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.940]   I really have to praise and thank God for his grace.
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.480]   Without his grace, I couldn't go through my study at the seminary for the past four years.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.400]   And can I tell you more about it later?
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.000]   I also want to thank my family and then my brothers and sisters who are watching online
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.600]   and some of them are here from my school, from the marketplace, from my small group,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600]   everywhere in the church.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.120]   Without your support, I couldn't go through this past four years as I walked through what
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.720]   I learned is my half time, that learning and discerning what God's will for me for my second
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.720]   half.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.720]   So thank you.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.080]   And then Pastor John was saying, I also want to thank my family, in particular, my wife,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.080]   my two kids.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.360]   I remember four years ago when I first told them, "What do you think about your father,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.840]   your husband being the only breadwinner, taking a few years off to go to seminary to study?"
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.520]   I remember what they tell me, is that, "If God calls you to do it, go ahead."
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.520]   And today, Pastor John just said, "It's my wife's birthday and on her birthday, she comes
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.960]   here instead of going to party, she comes here to support me."
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.440]   So that's what my family is for me.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.440]   Thank you and happy birthday, my love.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.400]   All right, back to my sermon.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:23.600]   Last week, Pastor John preached to us the first part of this sermon, "Faith in the Workplace."
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.320]   And he told us this division between secular and sacred.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.500]   Next slide, please.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:42.380]   He called for a new breed of disciple and asked us to break down walls, build bridges,
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.780]   and seek God's will in the workplace.
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:57.400]   In this tonight, in this second part of this sermon, I want to invite you into a space
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.240]   to reflect on this topic from a different perspective.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.620]   Me, I'm representing a layperson perspective.
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.020]   So tonight, I invite you to come here to reflect on this topic from a layperson perspective.
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:22.740]   Specifically, how do you feel about responding to this call for a new breed of disciples?
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:30.600]   This is also a call for all of us to enter into God's will to join Him for His kingdom
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.400]   work in transforming our city.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.200]   Most of us, we have a full-time job, and I also include those full-time mom and dad as
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.140]   well.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:53.600]   We are already so tired from our work, meeting demands from our managers, dealing with company
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:02.400]   politics, trying to outperform to get the next raise or get the next promotion.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.800]   When we come to church, I just want to take a break from my work.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:17.360]   I want to gain some energy from worship, from singing, from the sermon.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.520]   I don't want to connect anything back from work here to church.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.800]   I'm already so tired.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:34.800]   Besides, I don't think my work matters here in God's kingdom.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.040]   I remember a few weeks ago when Pastor James talked to us about a community-based church,
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:48.040]   and he challenged us to know each other more from a different perspective, knowing our
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.080]   wives, knowing different things, remember?
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:59.440]   But when Lillian and I, we've been in this church for almost 16 years, I wonder if many
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.560]   people know what we do for a living.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.840]   And look around you.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.820]   You may know the name of the people sitting next to you, but do you know what they do
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.640]   for a living?
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.000]   It seems like we know what our pastors do.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.760]   We know what Pastor John do, or Johnny and Michelle, what they do here.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.760]   And we know each other.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.960]   We may know, "Oh, this is worship team, Florence worship team, and we have ambassadors, we
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.680]   have sound person, we have deacons here."
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.880]   We all know people, they're serving roles, but that's all.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.600]   And other than that, we carry little roles in God's kingdom.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   In a sense, we are like nobody in God's kingdom.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:02.400]   As a nobody, coming back to this calling, how can we answer to this call for a new breed
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.120]   of disciples in God's kingdom?
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.920]   That call may sound so remote to you.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.000]   That certainly sound remote to me.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.600]   It seems like there are already so many obstacles for everyone, not just Christians in the marketplace.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:31.280]   And that is the state I want all of us to enter into the passage Bonnie just read to
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.400]   us, the story of Zacchaeus.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.440]   Zacchaeus is a unique character in the Bible stories.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.560]   He was not only a tax collector, he was the chief tax collector.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.240]   He was a wealthy person and he was a high ranking government officials.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.600]   Normally, people with that profile, you would expect he will receive VIP sitting on the
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.040]   first row and then in a popular event.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.600]   But you know from the story, that's not the case.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.640]   Zacchaeus was despised by his people.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:21.320]   He was an outcast to his people because of his profession.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:28.160]   Back then, as a tax collector, people despised people in the tax collector because what they
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.800]   do, they collect heavy taxes for the Roman Emperor.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:40.440]   And specifically for Zacchaeus, he was a Jew working for a foreign government.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:46.680]   That put him a traitor to his people of Israel.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:52.520]   And in verse 7, we knew that he was considered to be a sinner among the crowd.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.520]   And then in verse 3, the scripture also described him as a short man.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:09.640]   So from socially speaking and physically speaking, he was a nobody in the crowd.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:16.520]   Let's take a pause here and reflect that back to ourselves.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:25.600]   Do we see ourselves so far from Jesus when we try to live out our faith at work?
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.700]   For those of us working in the office, we may already be overwhelmed with all these
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.120]   challenges at work.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.520]   And even for those of us homemakers, and I know that.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:43.120]   I've been at home for the past four years, easily can take up the full days just doing
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.320]   house chores or meeting needs for our family.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:55.200]   And we say, how do we possibly answer to this call to break down walls, build bridges, and
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.120]   seek God's will in the workplace?
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.000]   That's just impossible.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.920]   And in the Bible passage, it's equally, it's also the same case for Zacchaeus.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:15.600]   Zacchaeus being a nobody, short and also despised by people socially and physically.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.320]   He has so many people in the crowd, he wants to see Jesus, the most popular guy, to come
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.240]   into his way.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:31.360]   That's just impossible for Zacchaeus to meet Jesus personally.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:38.520]   But then, when people ask, in a few chapters earlier, when people ask Jesus about salvation,
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:50.120]   Jesus replied, "What is impossible with man is possible with God."
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.640]   Let me first highlight a key word in the passage.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:02.480]   Next slide, please.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:09.480]   In this passage, in verse three, Luke used a word to describe Zacchaeus, the nobody.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.800]   He said, in the NIV version, he said, he wanted to see who Jesus was.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.400]   Actually, it's clearer in the ESV version.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:22.120]   He said, Zacchaeus was seeking to see who Jesus was.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:29.400]   The key word here in Greek is seek, sateo.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:36.440]   With this, his nobody status, Zacchaeus faced so many obstacles in trying to reach Jesus,
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.820]   but he didn't give up.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.840]   He climbed up a tree and tried to find a spot to see Jesus.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:48.680]   And then, here the story comes to a sudden turn when Jesus showed up.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:55.520]   When Jesus arrived to the spot where Zacchaeus climbed up a tree, he called Zacchaeus out
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.280]   of the whole crowd and said, "Wait a second here.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:08.800]   Why would Jesus, out of everyone here, when he stopped at a place and called out to Zacchaeus
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.200]   by his name, why?"
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.480]   Can I have the next slide, please?
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:23.560]   It is Zacchaeus' heart to seek Jesus despite all the challenges he faced.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:32.520]   In Luke 11, verse 9, Jesus said, "Ask and it will be given to you.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.320]   Seek and you will find.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.640]   Knock and the door will be opened to you."
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:45.000]   And that promise goes all the way back to the Old Testament.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   In the Old Testament, can I have the next slide, please?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.920]   In Moses said to the people of Israel, "But if from there you seek the Lord your God,
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:06.880]   you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul."
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:13.400]   Because Zacchaeus sought Jesus with all his heart and all his soul, despite all the challenges
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.760]   he needed to face, he found Jesus.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:27.200]   But then we need to ask, in this passage, who is seeking whom here?
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:35.640]   While Luke starts this passage by saying Zacchaeus was seeking to see Jesus, Luke ends this passage
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.880]   by saying – can I have the next slide, please?
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:48.640]   For the Son of Man comes to seek and save the lost.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:55.920]   Zacchaeus found Jesus because Jesus is seeking the lost.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.960]   It is the central theme of Jesus' ministry on earth.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:10.480]   The lost are those who do not know God in person, but also include those of us who struggle
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:19.800]   to live up our faith in the workplace, feeling lost.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:26.960]   If you are currently feeling lost in your life, or you feel powerless at work, remember
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.720]   this.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.600]   Seek Jesus at wherever you are.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:42.520]   In family, in the office, at school, you will be found.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:49.160]   So now let's take a look at what does it mean to be found by Jesus.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:56.200]   Let's take a closer look at Jesus' responses to Zacchaeus.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:04.160]   Jesus is seeking us to restore our true identity by knowing us personally.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.440]   Can I have the next slide, please?
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:16.800]   In verse 5, Jesus first responded to Zacchaeus and called him by his name.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.720]   Just now we learned that Zacchaeus was a nobody.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:28.760]   If you are nobody in God's kingdom, you may think nothing matters, so I don't need to
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.800]   do anything because I'm just a small potato.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:42.560]   Or in the other extreme, we may try very hard to think that we are somebody.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:48.600]   At work, we try to work very hard to prove that we are better than others.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.400]   And even in church, we try to take key position to think that we matter here.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:01.520]   We try different ways to gain recognition from other people.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:09.080]   But I remember last December when Pastor John shared with us the true meaning of Christmas,
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:22.200]   that Jesus being somebody as God's only son came to the world as nobody so that humans,
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:31.360]   we are nobody, can be somebody as God's children in his kingdom.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:38.720]   Instead of addressing Zacchaeus by his work title, say, "Chief Tax Collector," or his
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:47.880]   financial status, "Hey, Richie," Jesus called him by his name, Zacchaeus.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:56.640]   Jesus saw Zacchaeus as a human being made in God's image, more than just his role or
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.520]   his wealth.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:06.880]   Last week, you all know that President Xi Jinping was here in Hong Kong.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:15.920]   Imagine if he stopped right in front of you and call your name in person.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.960]   How would that make you feel?
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:27.880]   But what about Jesus, the God's only son, King of Kings, creator of the world, knows
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:44.240]   your name, Samuel, Wallace, Kelly, Ivan, Joseph, he knows your name.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.480]   When we know that, when we hold that belief that Jesus holds our name, we have a firm
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.760]   foundation with our identity in Christ.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:01.320]   And that foundation could be challenged by our changing roles in the world.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:08.720]   Personally, I've experienced several changes in my life in the past few years.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.280]   Let me tell you a bit more about myself now.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:18.960]   In the marketplace, I used to lead a team of portfolio managers to manage $5 billion
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.280]   US dollar of money for institution.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:29.640]   And then my whole team in Asia was made redundant and I was out of draft for a few months.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:35.560]   And then I went back to work for a startup firm to launch an investment strategy from
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.020]   scratch.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:42.800]   And now I'm a full-time student for the last four years.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:50.600]   And even in church, when I first came to KFC in 2004, I didn't do anything because we
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.440]   just started having children.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.800]   It's very difficult to serve.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.440]   We're nobody.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:02.760]   And then over time, we did babysitting, we teach Sunday school, we did youth mentors,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.340]   and then group leaders and something else.
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:10.120]   And now I'm just an intern.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:22.720]   So in...so Paul, Apostle Paul in Philippians 4, he said that he has found the secret of
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:29.000]   being content in any and every situation.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   I believe that secret lies with our identity in Christ.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:46.440]   Through the ups and downs, I hold on to my relationship with Jesus that he calls me personally
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.560]   to himself.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:56.840]   And in that moment, my heart was filled with love from God.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:08.400]   And I'm also experiencing the secret of being content in every and any situation because
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:20.040]   Jesus knows my name and Jesus knows your name.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:26.120]   He restored our identity as people made in God's image.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:32.460]   We are all somebody in God's kingdom.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.380]   But Jesus came here not just to restore our identity.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:44.080]   He also empowered us by entering into our life.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:52.260]   After Jesus called Zacchaeus by name, he invited himself to stay at Zacchaeus' house.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:20:01.080]   By staying in his house, Jesus wants to be in people's life, at home, in the office,
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.440]   at school, in church, wherever we go.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.480]   He doesn't just stay here in church or anywhere and expecting people to come here to worship
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.600]   him.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:21.000]   Instead, he wants to go out and be with you and be into your life.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:29.840]   When our life is filled with Jesus, he promised that we can live our life to its fullness.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:35.880]   And it's so full that we can share these blessings to other people around us.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.680]   And that's exactly what Zacchaeus experienced.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:45.400]   When Jesus said he wants to enter into his house, his heart was so filled with joy that
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:51.080]   he willingly and happily shared half of his possession to the poor.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:58.040]   He also promised to give back four times to whoever he cheated in the past.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:08.680]   When Jesus is in our life, in his life, Zacchaeus is empowered to participate in God's kingdom
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.960]   work by sharing the gospel with other people.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:20.040]   And this good news is not just telling people to believe in Jesus.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:28.880]   You may have heard a famous quote called "Preach the gospel, use words if necessary."
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.240]   That is a quote attributed to St. Francis of Assisi.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.440]   But that is actually a misquote.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.280]   A, St. Francis never said that.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:48.760]   And B, St. Francis actually meant for his preachers to encourage them to practice what
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.180]   they preach.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:57.200]   So the key here is we should share the gospel with both words and deed.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.880]   And Zacchaeus shared the good news with others by sharing his wealth.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.680]   Financial resources is usually a good way for us to share God's love, but it doesn't
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.440]   stop there.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:17.120]   Remember a few weeks ago when we learned about the church series, the disciples in times
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.000]   of act, when they were filled by the Holy Spirit, they spoke in tongue and shared the
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.280]   gospel.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:30.800]   In present time, when we are filled by the Holy Spirit, when we receive Jesus into our
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.400]   life, in the current context, we can speak the business language.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:43.400]   We can speak the family language of love to share the gospel with others.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:51.640]   Like having lunch with our colleagues or families to have authentic, build our authentic relationship.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:56.880]   Like listening to others to go through struggles together.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.800]   Or like doing business with love and justice from God.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:08.080]   In fact, that reminds me, this mask here is from a Christian friend of mine.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:16.120]   He is managing a mask, but also hiring a bunch of deaf and people cannot speak, cannot hear,
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.680]   to work for him and create a mask for the society.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:27.520]   That's another, this all these other way to share the gospel with people around us.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:35.200]   And last week, Pastor John said he was, he is, he still is an Alpha-holic and that would
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.040]   make me an Alpha-holic junior.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.040]   And next slide please.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   I've been doing Alpha in the marketplace for many years and here's one example here in
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.200]   the slide.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:53.520]   And if you can see, yes, this is right above us on the second floor.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:24:01.880]   It was an Alpha that we ran with KFC together with Central Gospel Mission and Alpha Hong
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.880]   Kong.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.200]   We had over a hundred people upstairs to have lunch together.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.400]   And generally in Alpha, we share meals with people, a casual meal with our colleagues
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.280]   or families or friends.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:21.560]   And then during the meals, we also engage them with a topic to discuss our faith and
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:28.600]   life and that's a very authentic way to share the gospel with others.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:33.800]   And in KFC, we plan to run a marketplace Alpha later this year.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:39.280]   So stay tuned on how you can participate.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:45.160]   In addition to utilizing our presence in the marketplace, we can also use our work experience
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:50.920]   to build the kingdom of God in church and in the family.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.920]   One example is one of our brothers, David Wong.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.160]   A few weeks ago, he was in the marketplace sharing his experience about cryptocurrency
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:08.000]   investment, a very hot topic investment, and then connected it to God's kingdom value.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.120]   And then also Pastor Johnny, later on in the summer, he will organize several career forums
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.720]   for our college students.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:25.920]   All of us, we can share our work experience, Pastor John earlier, to our next generation.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.960]   We can contribute our experience in God's kingdom.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:38.760]   God is seeking all of us, not just the pastors, but all of us to join his movement in the
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:43.920]   workplace and in the church for his work.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:52.560]   But then in doing all this, don't forget, Jesus is with us to do all this work.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:59.640]   Without Jesus, we can easily burn out or feel powerless when we do God's kingdom work.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.160]   And then head back to this nobody statuses, "Oh, it's so difficult.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.480]   I'm so powerless."
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:17.040]   But like Zacchaeus, when Jesus enters into our life, we are blessed so abundantly that
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:28.280]   we can share God's blessings with others just with our presence in the workplace.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:36.320]   Our presence, including our work experience or spiritual gift, can be offered as a pleasing
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:46.880]   sacrifice to God for building up the family of God in church and in the marketplace.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:55.440]   If we feel powerless in doing God's kingdom work, remember this, Jesus wants to enter
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:04.160]   into your life to empower us to join God for his mission.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.880]   Next slide, please.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:13.400]   Jesus not only restores our identity and empower us, he doesn't stop there.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.920]   He wants to connect us to a community of faith.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:27.360]   In verse 9 and 10, we just read, Jesus proclaims that salvation has come to the house of Zacchaeus,
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:33.480]   and he is also a son of Abraham.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.040]   Remember earlier, we said that Zacchaeus was despised by his people.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.880]   He was an outcast.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:52.880]   By calling Zacchaeus a son of Abraham, Jesus is connecting him back to a family, not justified
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:58.840]   by faith and not by works.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:05.280]   I know many Christians in the marketplace, when we share and pray and share love, I hear
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:13.720]   one common struggle we face, that we feel lonely, we feel alone in the marketplace,
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:20.880]   and we find no support to live out our faith in the workplace.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:26.400]   Yes, Christians are minority in the workplace.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:34.480]   And yes, the culture in the world is very different from the biblical values.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:40.360]   And this loneliness experienced by Christians in the marketplace is caused by a misbelief
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:54.120]   that salvation is only a personal matter, and Christian faith is just a private practice.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:29:04.460]   But in this passage, we see from Jesus' proclamation, saying that salvation is also communal in
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:11.680]   nature, and we belong to a family of faith.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:19.040]   And that family of faith goes beyond these four walls of the church.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:26.040]   Outside Cornfolk Church, I've been actively connecting with Christians in the marketplace.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:31.880]   When I first came back to Hong Kong from Boston in 2004, I didn't know anyone in the church
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.000]   or in the office, but then I didn't wait.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.220]   I started a Bible study group in my office.
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:44.000]   And then God slowly connecting me to other Christians working in the same building at
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.280]   IFC, and we prayed together for our workplace.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.320]   And then things start to happen.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.320]   Next slide.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:56.560]   Here's some photos in the next few slides.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:02.840]   The photo on the left is a choir made up by Marketplace in Christians.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:08.000]   For a few years, we were able to sing Christmas carols at the IFC malls.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:16.720]   This is such a great opportunity to praise God and testify our faith in our own workplace
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.720]   community.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:23.600]   It also connects us from different churches, different companies, serving together for
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.040]   the same mission of God.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:32.440]   And then the picture to the right, it's also happened in the same place, IFC mall.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.440]   It's a bunch of leaders.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:38.160]   We call it IFC Alpha, that we've run several years.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.440]   These are just the leaders.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:44.720]   And over the years, we were able to, just one location, we were able to reach over hundreds
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.280]   or even thousands of people at the IFC through Alpha.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:55.900]   And through, again, having meals with others and chatting about topic about faith.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.900]   Next slide.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:01.720]   And, but God doesn't stop me just at Central or in my place.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.160]   He also connect me to this citywide network.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.840]   The photos here on the top is a core team of leaders.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:17.680]   We call it the Alpha Spark Network, that we try to promote Alpha everywhere in the marketplace.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:24.720]   And then another photo to the right is a small group, what we call a halftime network.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:32.000]   This is a group of people organized, actually led by also David Wong, to help professionals
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:41.560]   or anyone, or even pastors to seek the significance of our vocation in our second half, like what
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.360]   I'm doing.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:49.000]   And then the photos at the bottom is another movement, citywide movement, called Ecclesiastical
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.560]   Movement, that we pray every month through Zoom, over the phone.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:59.880]   But then here, every year on New Year's Day, we went up to the peak and pray for Hong Kong.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.160]   It's so exciting.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.240]   But then this network, it also takes in different forms.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.360]   Next slide.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:15.120]   The photos on the left is a group of Christian parents trying to pray for the high school
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.440]   attended by my kids, Lucas and Charis.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:23.600]   And then in that network, we got to meet teachers and pastors working in the school.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:31.160]   We also get to meet Young Life, the organization James serves, and it's that citywide network.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:35.000]   It's so exciting to pray for school with others.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:42.640]   And then the photos on the right is a network that I started two years ago, called Marketplace
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.480]   Network for Christ.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:51.180]   It is a network that we meet every week, even over the past two years, during COVID time,
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:58.080]   we meet every, we gather every week over Zoom and lunchtime, and we seek God in the marketplace
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.720]   together.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.680]   And here in this photo, I want to highlight one person here.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:12.440]   If you have good eyes, you will see that at the bottom and the center, that's Pastor John.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:23.800]   I have to say that Pastor John is truly a pastor who practices what he preaches.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:32.320]   Before I worked here at KFCI as intern, I must say, I see Pastor John more in the marketplace
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.000]   than in the church office or here in this fellowship hall.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.960]   This man was just everywhere that we meet everywhere, like the Ecclesiastical Network,
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:50.320]   the YMCA, at Alpha, at Movement Day, everything, many other things.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:56.040]   And even in places you wouldn't expect a Westerner to be there, some Chinese speaking worship
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:00.840]   conference, I also meet Pastor John there.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:11.360]   He just dedicated his time to walk with Christians in building up this citywide network.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:21.040]   But what I want to say here is that all this group has one thing in common, that God is
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:28.240]   called, is gathering Christians all over the city to come together and share a journey
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:37.480]   in building a faithful community to seek God's will at wherever we are in our presence, in
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.080]   places of our presence.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:46.560]   Every week I come to KFCI to worship with you all, that's certainly a highlight of my
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.080]   week.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.520]   But it doesn't stop here.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:58.520]   I'm equally excited every week to meet Christians in the marketplace Monday to Friday.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:05.800]   And we together, we have a mission mindset to seek God's work, God's will in the marketplace
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.360]   everywhere in our city.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.500]   That is just so exciting.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:19.660]   And that community in the marketplace keeps me excited every Monday morning to look forward
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:26.520]   to joining God's adventure with God in the marketplace.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.080]   And all these years I have witnessed one truth.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.320]   You have to remember one thing tonight.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:43.040]   God is actively at work in our city, in the workplace.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:52.300]   And He is calling Christians, all of us, at home, at school, in the office, anywhere we
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:36:02.700]   go to join Him for this kingdom work and building a faithful community.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:07.260]   Christians are not alone in the marketplace.
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:17.220]   God is with us and He has already put special agents, that is you and me, in the marketplace.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:21.140]   At home, in the office, at school, everywhere we are.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.920]   We don't need to wait for the church to come out.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:31.420]   We just need to seek God at wherever we are.
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:40.140]   The Holy Spirit will connect us to a community in the marketplace.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:45.260]   Let's have a summary of what I just did in this sermon here.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:48.580]   Next slide, please.
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:58.180]   We are all called to join God to live out our faith in the workplace.
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:06.420]   And in times when we feel lost or when there are so many obstacles in the workplace that
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:11.420]   make us feel like we're so far from Jesus.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:20.940]   Like Zacchaeus, we can seek Jesus with our hearts at wherever we are and we will be found
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.780]   by Jesus.
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:36.980]   In Christ, when we feel that we are nobody, Jesus comes to restore our identity as children
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.440]   in God's kingdom.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.240]   Jesus knows our name.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.780]   He knows everything in us.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:55.820]   Our work Monday to Friday or our service at church, everything matters in God's kingdom.
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:06.360]   In Christ, if you feel powerless, Jesus enters into your life to empower us.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:15.600]   He fills our life with his love so that we can live it to its fullness and share it to
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:23.800]   others and participate in God's kingdom work with everything we need from God, our gift
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.180]   from God.
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:39.700]   And in Christ, if we feel alone, Jesus, God will connect us to a community that's where
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:46.600]   we can belong and have someone to walk with us together in our life.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:57.300]   So tonight, for those of us, if you have not received Jesus into your life, I invite you
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:03.980]   to seek Jesus into your heart.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:10.700]   God will restore your identity as children of God.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:21.260]   He will fill your life to its fullness, and then he will lead you to a family to walk
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:25.900]   this life journey together.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:34.700]   And for my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ, when you feel lonely, alone, powerless
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:44.220]   at work, I invite you to seek Jesus with your heart as well.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:56.260]   Jesus, God will recognize your identity and your gift, your whole self in his kingdom.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:03.040]   He will empower you and fills you with all you need to live out faith.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.360]   And then you are not alone.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:12.500]   He will connect you to his special agents, his Christians, his people in the workplace,
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:20.340]   in school, at work, everywhere we go to form this faithful community together and to answer
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:25.420]   again back to this call to live out our faith in the workplace.
