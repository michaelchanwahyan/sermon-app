1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 - Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,440
 Can you hear me?

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,440
 I feel like I can't hear myself.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
 Okay.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,520
 It's great to be with you guys.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,440
 I'm really glad to be sharing a message today.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,760
 It's been on my heart to share about what it really means to bear one another's burden.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:29,480
 Because many a times, you just think that we can come into faith, and this is a one-to-one

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,600
 thing where it's a relationship between just us and God.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,080
 But God has actually given us a community to be with.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,680
 And we've not only called to have a one-on-one relationship with God, but we've been called

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,400
 to have a relationship with the people around us in the community.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,180
 And so today, we're gonna be looking at how we can bear one another's burden by looking

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,440
 at Galatians chapter six, verse one to two.

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,720
 Now before we get to that, I do wanna tell you a little bit of a background of what the

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,680
 book of Galatians was like.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,820
 Now at that time, it was actually a letter written by Apostle Paul, and he was telling

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,840
 the churches in Galatia an issue that was disturbing them.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
 Now what was the issue?

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:22,000
 The issue was that there were agitators, and they were telling the people that even though

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,560
 you have believed in Jesus, you still needed to follow the laws that were handed down by

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,760
 Moses.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,880
 And now, Apostle Paul knew that this isn't right, so he wrote letters.

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,040
 And this letter, all six chapters address the different points that he wanted to tell

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,520
 the people there.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,160
 And so as we look into this book, this is what we're gonna see.

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,440
 And so he's been trying to tell them that don't live by the laws, don't just follow

28
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,720
 them like rules, instead live in the spirit.

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,440
 And if you, one of the more famous passages from Galatians chapter five is that, the fruit

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,120
 of the spirits, and do you know all the fruit of the spirits?

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
 Yes.

32
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:21,840
 Love, joy, peace, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness.

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,520
 Don't forget patience, yes.

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,780
 Self-control.

35
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,640
 And why is it that he's asking them to do that?

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,880
 Is because right before then, he's saying that you need to live by the spirit.

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,000
 It doesn't mean that the law doesn't matter anymore, because the law is actually lived

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,520
 through the spirit.

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,720
 What that means is when you live by the spirit and have all these fruits, you have already

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,120
 followed the laws.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,400
 And what does the law say?

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,320
 The law actually wanted people to be away from the flesh.

43
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,860
 What was the flesh?

44
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:02,440
 So it would be being jealous of one another, envy, it would be ways that we would just

45
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,840
 wanna be a part of, we wanna take over what people have.

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:16,600
 And so, Apostle Paul really is telling everyone, "Hey, don't live in the flesh, but instead

47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,480
 live in the spirit."

48
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,000
 And then he started introducing to us what it means to live in the spirit as a community.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,320
 And that's when we get to chapter six.

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,560
 So I've just given you the background and now I want us to read together Galatians six

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,040
 verse one to two.

52
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,680
 Okay, shall we read it together?

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
 All right, one, two, three.

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:45,280
 "Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,520
 the spirit of gentleness.

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,920
 Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.

57
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,760
 Bear one another's burden and so fulfill the law of Christ."

58
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,480
 Now when you first read this, you're like, "Yeah, I think I pretty much get the whole

59
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
 verse.

60
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,600
 Are we gonna spend like all 30 minutes on this?"

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,560
 Well, yes and no.

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,960
 So when you first read this, I don't know about you, but I started to have some questions.

63
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:18,800
 For example, when Paul says that we're to restore someone in the spirit of gentleness,

64
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
 what does that mean?

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:27,400
 I mean, I get all the words spirit and gentleness, but how is that different from just gentleness?

66
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,720
 And when he keeps going and says, "Lest you be tempted."

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,280
 Now why would we be tempted if we were trying to restore someone?

68
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,120
 If we were trying to ask people, "Hey, don't steal."

69
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,320
 Does it mean that I'm gonna be tempted in stealing?

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,560
 And also we keep reading and there's this bear one another's burden.

71
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,300
 We understand all those words, but what does that really look like in our everyday life?

72
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,280
 And also he also says that it is to fulfill the law of Christ.

73
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,760
 Now I explained a little bit about that earlier, but you know that the law of Christ, this

74
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,480
 phrase, it's only found here.

75
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,320
 It has only appeared in the Bible once.

76
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
 So now what is he trying to say?

77
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,640
 So we will get to all those one at a time, but I do want to start us off by thinking

78
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:18,980
 about when we bear in one another's burden, the very first thing that Apostle Paul is

79
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,140
 telling us is that it is in Jesus' way.

80
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,320
 What does it mean to be in Jesus' way?

81
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,480
 That means that when we bear one another's burden, we're not doing it in our way.

82
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,560
 We're not doing it in the flesh or how people tell us, but we're doing it in Jesus' way.

83
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,640
 And now we can see that he's actually used the spirit of gentleness to tell us about

84
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
 that.

85
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,440
 Now when we use it in Jesus' spirit, what is really the main difference?

86
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:54,240
 Now the English word for gentleness, it means to be tender, to be kind, but in our sense,

87
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,240
 in the biblical sense, when we're talking about the spirit of gentleness, it's more

88
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,320
 than that.

89
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,200
 Do you know what that is?

90
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,140
 It is when we have compassion for someone else.

91
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,820
 It is when we can stand in their shoes and say, "We understand.

92
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,900
 Why is it that this has happened to you?"

93
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,720
 Now let me explain a little bit more and maybe it'll give you a more flavor to that.

94
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:29,080
 Well it means that when, I remember there were, when I was a kid, wait a minute, I'd

95
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,280
 actually never stole cookies, but somebody did steal cookies and they would steal the

96
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,800
 cookie and what would they do?

97
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,720
 When they were caught, they would be scared.

98
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
 Why?

99
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,480
 Because they knew that they would be condemned, probably by parents or by teachers.

100
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,280
 And so they weren't looking forward to that.

101
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
 And I mean, we don't have to even go to kids.

102
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,960
 We can go to our dogs.

103
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,600
 I mean, when I used to have a dog, he would take my socks and he would chew it up.

104
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,360
 And you know, when I come home, I would never be able to find him.

105
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,760
 But when I did, you know that his ear is going to be dripped down and he's going to have

106
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,400
 that innocent look on his face.

107
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
 Why?

108
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,480
 Only so that I won't condemn him and that I won't punish him.

109
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,640
 Now you might be thinking, "What does the dog and that have to do with us, gentleness?"

110
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:25,280
 Well really it's trying to tell us that remember when Jesus, actually when the Pharisees in

111
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:33,320
 the scribes brought a lady who was caught in adultery to Jesus and they asked Jesus,

112
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,120
 "What shall we do with him in order to test him?"

113
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,320
 And Jesus said that...

114
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,240
 They said that, "What does the law say?"

115
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,720
 The law asks for punishment.

116
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:55,040
 And so Jesus said, "All right, well anybody who has not sinned, you can stone her to death."

117
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:01,340
 And now from the old to the young, they left because everyone has sinned.

118
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,720
 And so Jesus then stood up and told the woman, "Where's everybody?"

119
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,240
 "Well, neither will I condemn you, but do not sin anymore."

120
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,240
 And so we can see that in the spirit of gentleness, we have this first point that when we bear

121
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,480
 one another's burden in Jesus' way, the very first way is we do it in his spirit, having

122
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,200
 his character.

123
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,520
 This is not about us being nice to someone.

124
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,840
 It is about us living out the spirit of God so that people will know who God is.

125
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:43,120
 And so when we bear each other's burdens, we who first do it in his spirit, and that

126
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,680
 would be doing it Jesus' way.

127
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:55,360
 Now as we read on, we're going to see that because Jesus doesn't only address to one

128
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,500
 group of people, he actually addresses to different people and their different needs.

129
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,000
 And the second way that I want to say that we can bear each other's burden is that we

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,560
 need to address to all the people's burdens, to all the people at all times.

131
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,360
 Now Jesus never says, "Oh, well, I can take care of this person's sickness, but I won't

132
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,000
 take care of this person."

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 He's not.

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 He shows no partiality.

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,600
 He's going to help this person.

136
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,280
 He's going to help that person when they need it.

137
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,200
 And so when we're following Jesus, we're doing the same thing.

138
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,600
 We're not choosing people that we know a bit better so that we'll just help those.

139
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,080
 And we're not choosing, "Oh, this burden seems easy.

140
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,720
 I think I'll go for this one.

141
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
 That one's kind of hard.

142
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,400
 I'm going to save it for Pastor John or someone else."

143
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:53,600
 No, we're going to be just like Jesus when we carry each other's burdens.

144
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,220
 And this, Jesus tells us that when we bear each other's burden, we're actually fulfilling

145
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,000
 the law of Christ.

146
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,400
 Now this is very important because we want to fulfill God and what he requires of us.

147
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:18,600
 And yet it tells us that in here, we're not just meeting it like those items on a rule.

148
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,480
 We're not meeting it like, "Oh, I've done this.

149
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
 I've done this.

150
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
 I've done this."

151
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,600
 No, he's saying that the law of Christ, what is that?

152
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:35,060
 And if we have read it before, that the Bible says Jesus has summed it up and that the first

153
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,520
 one is to love your God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul, with

154
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,800
 all your heart.

155
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,840
 And then the second one is what?

156
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,080
 Love your neighbor as yourself.

157
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:52,160
 And so the third way really for us to be bearing one another's burden in Jesus' way is that

158
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,160
 we are loving them, not because there's a rule that says we need to, but because we

159
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:03,220
 genuinely care and love for them like Jesus does.

160
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:09,080
 And so we want to give you a bit of flavor about what that really is, because in this

161
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:16,480
 passage we can see that Apostle Paul has used this example to show us that the spirit of

162
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,300
 gentleness was for when someone was caught in a transgression.

163
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,300
 But there are other fruits of the spirit, other characters of those, that in different

164
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,280
 scenarios we're going to carry them out too.

165
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,200
 So for example, instead of condemning someone when they're caught, we mentioned that we're

166
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,880
 going to be compassionate about them.

167
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,600
 Now, instead of being angry, we're going to be kind to them.

168
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,740
 So there are all these different ways.

169
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,840
 And when we see that someone has a need, we're going to use, or Holy Spirit is going to help

170
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,560
 us so that one of the characteristics or more of the characteristics of the spirit is being

171
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
 manifested.

172
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,720
 So today we're very glad that we're able to invite one of our clan leader, Josh, to help

173
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,000
 us share about how it is that in our everyday life we're going to see that in action.

174
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,040
 So let's give him a warm welcome.

175
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,920
 No, I'm going to sit down.

176
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
 Hey everyone.

177
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,320
 For those of you who don't know me, my name is Josh.

178
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,520
 I'm one of the clan leaders here.

179
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,380
 And Michelle asked me to kind of come up during this part and share a little bit about how

180
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,960
 community and bearing with one another's burdens can look like in real life.

181
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,200
 But before I do, let me just ask you, what is a burden?

182
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,880
 Do you guys know?

183
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,160
 What are some of the burdens that we have?

184
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,560
 Any thoughts?

185
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,680
 There are lots of different things which are included in the concept of burdens, whether

186
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,120
 it be sin, whether it be challenges, whether it be temptations, like it says in verse one,

187
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,600
 these are the burdens that Paul is calling for us as Christians to bear.

188
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,800
 So I was part of a small group back many years ago when I was much, much younger.

189
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,040
 And we came together because we felt through reading scripture, like this passage, that

190
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,760
 we should gather together in community and help each other bear with temptations and

191
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,440
 with the challenges of sin, like it says in verse one.

192
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,280
 And I think a lot of church groups, a lot of Christians, they know that this is something

193
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
 that we should do.

194
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,560
 How many of you guys have heard something similar, that we should gather in community?

195
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
 Okay.

196
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
 Oh, not that many of you.

197
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
 Okay.

198
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,880
 Let me tell you first, you should gather together in community because there's a lot of things

199
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,120
 which we are called to do as Christians, which are not easy to do.

200
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,600
 A lot of temptations to avoid, a lot of accountability to be had.

201
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,320
 So we came together to read the word of God, to pray together, to hold each other accountable,

202
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,840
 all the good Christian stuff.

203
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:51,920
 But one day we were gathered and one of the people in our small group had a very serious

204
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,960
 medical emergency.

205
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,680
 His knee ruptured, like that.

206
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,040
 It exploded while he was doing some sporting activity, which he really shouldn't have been

207
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,200
 doing and it was a mess.

208
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,960
 And he was visiting Hong Kong for a medium term amount of time.

209
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,840
 He didn't have access to public healthcare and as such he couldn't fix his knee.

210
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,320
 So he couldn't walk, he couldn't get it fixed, he couldn't fly to go back home to the States

211
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,520
 to get his knee fixed.

212
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,680
 And so he was kind of stuck.

213
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,000
 Now we were all in our group, we were quite young and poor.

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,040
 Many of us were still in uni, some of us were just starting our careers.

215
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,900
 But as we considered the word of God and we read that we should bear one another's burdens,

216
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,320
 we realized that those burdens didn't just mean praying for one another, dealing with

217
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,600
 sin, helping each other with temptation, but also with practical realities as well.

218
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,920
 It also includes, by the way, bearing with one another's questions and patience, but

219
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,400
 we'll get to that another time.

220
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,520
 So we came together and we helped him out.

221
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,440
 We paid for all of his medical bills as a group.

222
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,720
 Thankfully we were a somewhat large group at the time, so we were able to chip in enough

223
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,000
 money to pay for his medical bills so that he could get a knee reconstruction surgery,

224
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,400
 he'd get all the swelling taken out.

225
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,560
 He healed up, managed to make it back to the States in one piece, injured his knee again

226
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,360
 but then got better, and it was good.

227
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,800
 You know, one of the things that happened as a result of us obeying the word of God

228
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:25,480
 was that our community, our small group, became so much closer than I'd ever thought possible.

229
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,560
 Some of you who know my current small group know that we're really tight.

230
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,720
 We're like a spiritual family.

231
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
 We do everything together.

232
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,920
 We go on vacations together, we hang out with one another.

233
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,720
 That really started from that one moment.

234
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,880
 When we are not only praying for one another, not only encouraging one another to deal with

235
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,680
 sin, but we also help each other, you know, putting people through university, making

236
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,840
 sure that we are always looking out for one another physically.

237
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,480
 If someone's father, like say, has a stroke and they need help with medical support, we

238
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,440
 all chip in in those areas.

239
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,640
 That really draws us together in community.

240
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:11,880
 I would encourage us as a church that we are called to bear with one another's burdens,

241
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:19,840
 both spiritual and physical, both in the church when it comes to dealing with the many challenges

242
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,560
 of temptation, but also practical as well.

243
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:31,780
 And you know, there are so many challenges that face Christians today, with so many different

244
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:38,280
 polarizing opinions out there, so many different ways to get angry at stuff.

245
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:44,880
 We can hold each other accountable in having right attitudes and in dealing with many of

246
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,120
 the challenges of hate that exist, but we can also support one another.

247
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,760
 So I would encourage you, if you're not part of a community now, if you're not part of

248
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,960
 a small group, what we call clans here, our community life and nurture groups, if you're

249
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:05,280
 not part of one of those, I would encourage you to take part, to be part of that community.

250
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,600
 And as you are, feel free to invest in one another.

251
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,680
 Help one another as you deal with temptations or challenges.

252
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:22,200
 Help the other people in your clan who might be struggling with actual physical medical

253
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,760
 conditions or hardships.

254
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:32,320
 If someone needs help with looking after their newborn kid, help them out with that.

255
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
 I would encourage...

256
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,440
 Wow, it took you guys really long, right?

257
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
 Yeah.

258
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
 So...

259
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,920
 No, no, it's cool, it's cool.

260
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,920
 But I would say, you know, honestly, I have been super blessed.

261
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:51,400
 Being part of my small group, which is the same small group after many years, has been

262
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,840
 one of the most incredible experiences of my life, and I would not have been able to

263
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,240
 survive through so many of the different stages of my life and the many challenges that I've

264
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,400
 faced over the last six, seven years if it wasn't for my clan.

265
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,520
 So if you guys aren't part of one, I would really encourage you to look into getting

266
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
 one, getting to be part of one.

267
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,880
 I know there's several starting, I know that Michelle is starting a bunch of new ones,

268
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,280
 I know that there are a lot that are looking to grow.

269
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:23,160
 So yeah, I would really say it's one of the best things ever.

270
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,880
 It does take a little bit of work, a lot of crazy people in there, but it's awesome to

271
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,160
 be part of a community in the church.

272
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,520
 So I encourage you guys with that.

273
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,160
 Thank you, Josh.

274
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,960
 I mean, as Josh was sharing, I think one of the things that I really saw in those moments

275
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,800
 when they chipped in, when they were there for one another, you know what that was?

276
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,440
 That they were loving one another just like they would for themselves.

277
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,440
 So I think that's beautiful, how he shared it.

278
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,720
 And so when we do that, when we're in a community, when we support one another and carry each

279
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,080
 other's burdens, we're able to fulfill the law of Christ.

280
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:21,000
 So now as we move on to look at, there are other things that these two verses are telling

281
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,320
 us that we need to watch out.

282
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,240
 Now one of the things is we need to watch out for ourselves.

283
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,200
 Now remember the line where it says, "Watch out that you don't be tempted."

284
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
 Remember that one?

285
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,440
 It's right, "Keep watch on yourself, least you be tempted."

286
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,760
 Now all of a sudden he mentions this.

287
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,560
 Why does he do that?

288
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,440
 Now because, imagine this, that you're helping out that person, you're helping out this person,

289
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,520
 and before you know it, what do you feel like?

290
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,040
 You feel like a superman.

291
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,400
 You're like a superwoman, right?

292
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,520
 And very soon maybe they were sharing with you about some burdens that they have, and

293
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,460
 it's easy for us to start judging them and start saying that, "Oh, I'm so much better.

294
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,520
 I'm so much smarter, I'm able to withhold these things, and I'm not having problems

295
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,240
 in these areas."

296
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,120
 So it's easy for us that when we're helping someone, when we're carrying other people's

297
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,000
 burden that we will fall into this trap.

298
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,120
 So really Paul is telling us, "Watch out.

299
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,640
 Keep watch for yourself."

300
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,760
 Because if we don't, we can easily then fall into that trap and someone will have to get

301
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,080
 us out, right?

302
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,900
 Someone will have to tell us and carry our burden for falling in that trap.

303
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:46,940
 And so another thing that we have to do is that when we do that, when we know that we

304
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:52,620
 can easily be tempted to, it makes us know that we're human beings.

305
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,900
 Remember I said, "You don't wanna think that you're a superhero."

306
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,720
 We're just human beings.

307
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:04,160
 And the only way that we were ever able to not fall into certain transgressions or not

308
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,680
 have certain weakness was only because God had been sustaining us.

309
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,880
 And so when we recognize that and when we acknowledge that we might fall into temptation

310
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,700
 and watch for ourselves, we're able to prevent that from happening and we're able to know

311
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,560
 that we are just humans.

312
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,120
 And you know what's the best part about being just humans?

313
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,740
 That means we don't have to be perfect.

314
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,600
 It means that after you've tried to help someone, tried to carry their burden, and somehow if

315
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,540
 it still didn't work out, that it's okay.

316
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,240
 It's okay to be humans.

317
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,880
 And at the same time, once we're able to overcome that temptation, once we're able to say, "Hey,

318
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,280
 I was so close to being tempted, but God helped me through maybe reading the Bible or maybe

319
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,480
 he just reminded me that, hey, this is happening.

320
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,680
 I'm realizing that there's a change in my emotions towards a certain person after I've

321
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,040
 helped them."

322
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:11,800
 Then we're able to help others and we're able to help ourselves because we become stronger

323
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,360
 Christians and we are able then to be a more mature Christian.

324
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,360
 So throughout this, while we're bearing each other's burden, while we're carrying these

325
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,280
 out, not only do we carry them out in Jesus' way, but at the same time, we need to watch

326
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,520
 out to make sure that we don't fall into any temptations.

327
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,680
 Now the last part is that we bear each other's burden knowing that it takes two.

328
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,480
 I wanted to say it takes two to tangle, but I actually don't know how to tangle, so I

329
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,240
 thought I'll leave that out.

330
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,920
 So it takes two.

331
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
 What does that mean?

332
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,000
 If you are going to bear one another, it means that there's someone bearing and there's someone

333
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,080
 allowing you to bear.

334
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,680
 And what that means is, first thing is we need each other.

335
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,200
 I mean, all of us need each other.

336
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,680
 There's not one person here that never needs someone else and they can just live by themselves.

337
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,040
 Wait, saving Private Ryan, was there someone that lived by himself?

338
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,400
 But we're not called for that.

339
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,320
 We were called to live in a community where we need one another.

340
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,440
 Because sometimes I'm weak and you're able to help me.

341
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
 Sometimes you're weak and I'm able to help you.

342
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,520
 Hopefully we're not weak at the same time, but even if we were, we can help each other.

343
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,320
 And so knowing that we need each other is a way for us to humble ourselves.

344
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:45,360
 And at the same time, if we're the one that needs our burdens to be carried, we actually

345
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,960
 have the responsibility to speak up.

346
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,800
 Now I know some of us like to go solo.

347
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,040
 Some of us don't want to burden other people.

348
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:01,360
 Some of us think that if we have to depend on someone, it's a sign of weakness.

349
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,080
 But really it isn't.

350
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:11,000
 When we are able to speak up, it is speaking from a sign of humility and also a sign of

351
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,280
 strength.

352
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,800
 Because we're able to recognize that, "Hey, it's okay.

353
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,500
 I'm a human being and I can accept myself to be imperfect."

354
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,120
 That is strength and humility.

355
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,760
 And it's okay that if I tell someone about it, I'm not worried that because they know

356
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,520
 this, now they're going to look badly at me.

357
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,560
 And even if they are, I'm so confident that it doesn't matter.

358
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,320
 I'm not going to be affected by it.

359
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:44,960
 So when we're able to speak up of our needs, it is standing from a position of strength.

360
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,680
 And so for us to learn that role is so important.

361
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,900
 Because if we don't, then we can end up just being by ourselves, not getting the support

362
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,520
 that we need from the community that God has blessed us with.

363
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,320
 Now the other part, of course, the other party is that we need to be intentional.

364
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:09,520
 We need to be intentional in helping the people that aren't able to speak up.

365
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:18,760
 Because sometimes, just like us today, sitting here today, you're not going to know the things

366
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,840
 that the other person is going through if we're not intentional about it.

367
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,120
 Because we can all have a nice smile and we can ask, "Hey, how are you doing?"

368
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,440
 And you know what?

369
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
 We get the standard answer, "Oh, I'm good.

370
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
 I'm fine."

371
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,240
 And that's it, right?

372
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,480
 And then maybe there's this awkward silence and we're not sure quite what to do with it.

373
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,920
 But if we're intentional, we can ask open-ended questions.

374
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,080
 So maybe we can ask instead of, "Hey, how's it going?"

375
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,920
 Which we kind of know the standard answer.

376
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,000
 We can ask things like, "Hey, what has been on your mind lately?"

377
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,640
 Unless they say blank, but most likely not.

378
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,000
 They're usually going to share with you, "Oh, I was worried about this.

379
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,360
 My exam's coming up."

380
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,760
 Or, "I had a fight with someone."

381
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,760
 And so it starts a conversation and we have to be intentional.

382
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,960
 And of course, when we start that conversation, it also means that if we're intentional, we

383
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,400
 have to set aside some time to really listen to what is happening in their lives.

384
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,520
 So today, I actually want to share with you a story recently that happened.

385
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,000
 And I think it really spoke to me about what it means to bear each other's burden.

386
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
 So last week, I was off the entire week.

387
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,820
 I got the whole week to go to my school so that I could study for an intensive course.

388
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,320
 So I was in day four.

389
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,000
 Okay, what an intensive course means is that we start early at nine and finish at five.

390
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,520
 And the only break that we get is the lunch break.

391
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,560
 I mean, we do get snippets of breaks, but pretty much is the whole day.

392
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,840
 So I was on my fourth day exhausted.

393
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,240
 And of course, last week, I happened to be preaching as well.

394
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,560
 So I was trying to work on my sermon at nighttime and trying to get that done.

395
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,800
 So I was exhausted, but I was very happy because it was Thursday evening.

396
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,080
 So I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

397
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,000
 And I thought, "All right, just a little bit more and it'll be there."

398
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,680
 So I was just very comfortable getting water at the pantry.

399
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:27,120
 And then I see my classmate walking in and just doing my standard thing.

400
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,240
 I gave them the nice smile and I said, "Hey, how's it going?"

401
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,200
 I was not very intentional there.

402
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,960
 I was hoping for the "I'm okay" answer.

403
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,280
 So I just getting water, "Hey, how's it going?"

404
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,960
 And then she said, "I'm not doing well."

405
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,760
 She said, "Something happened at my church," which actually was unexpected because I actually

406
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,760
 looked at my app and my bus was 10 minutes away.

407
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,600
 So I was thinking I will catch it right after I get the water, even though the bus stop

408
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,080
 is right outside.

409
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,020
 So I was like, "Oh, well."

410
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,440
 So struggling a bit, but I said, "Oh, so what happened?"

411
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,680
 I wanted to know within five minutes time frame.

412
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:22,080
 And then she said, "My brother from church, much older, is an older man.

413
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,400
 He just committed suicide yesterday."

414
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,120
 And so when I heard that, I was like, "Oh."

415
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:37,320
 And I was just feeling synced because I've also had family members who had that issue.

416
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,040
 And so I really thought, "Wow, this is so sad.

417
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,320
 How is she doing?"

418
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,160
 So I said, "How did it happen?

419
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,240
 What happened?"

420
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,520
 And so she said, "Actually, this man, he has been going to our church for a few years now.

421
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:59,380
 He's baptized and he comes to all of our whatever outings we have, whatever activities we have,

422
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,400
 he comes to all of those."

423
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,640
 And this was really shocking.

424
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,960
 And even last week, he was at the prayer meeting.

425
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:15,040
 And so when I heard that, I was like, "This is really bad."

426
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,720
 Now I just want to show you the flesh side of me, the human side of me.

427
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:27,660
 I was actually checking the clock in the back to see if I would catch my bus.

428
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:33,800
 And I really struggled because I thought to myself, "All right, I have to wake up at seven

429
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,440
 in the morning the next day to go to class.

430
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,800
 I do want to ask her more and to give her some comfort."

431
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,760
 But I also thought about the sermon that was not done.

432
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,600
 And I also thought about, you know, I'm actually a pastor at KFCI, and I thought I didn't even

433
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,240
 get a chance to call all of my members.

434
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,760
 And so all of that, of course, you know, I'm just telling you the human side of me.

435
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,080
 And all of that just flashed by in like two seconds.

436
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:11,400
 And at the same time, I believe it was the spirit of love that was speaking in my heart.

437
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:20,240
 I looked at her more intensely as she was still talking, and I saw that God has put

438
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:27,400
 her in front of me at this time, in this moment, not someone else, but me.

439
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:33,720
 And at the same time as I was looking at her, I felt that God loved her.

440
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:40,400
 And I thought to myself, "If God loved her, and I'm his vessel because he has saved me

441
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,760
 from all my sins, shouldn't I be looking after her at this time?

442
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,560
 I mean, what is another 30 minutes to me?

443
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,800
 The next bus comes in 35 minutes, just FYI."

444
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,960
 And so after that struggle, I thought, "You know what?

445
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,000
 Forget about the bus, okay?

446
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,520
 Be here, be present."

447
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,040
 And so I said, "Tell me more.

448
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,320
 Tell me more what happened.

449
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
 How are you feeling?

450
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,960
 How are they?"

451
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,000
 And so she told me about how they used to be at church, and then they would pass by

452
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,440
 each other, they would have these little conversations, and how shocking it was for her.

453
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,240
 And so we chatted, and then we had a nice time to pray.

454
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,400
 We prayed together.

455
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,420
 We also prayed for that man's family, because they were non-Christians, and we're thinking

456
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,960
 about using a non-Christian type of memorial.

457
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,720
 So we prayed for their families also to have that peace in this time, because it was so

458
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,280
 shocking.

459
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,080
 And so we parted ways.

460
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:58,520
 Before we parted, I gave her the coronavirus forbidden hug, and then we left, and I went

461
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,240
 to take the next bus that was just about to come.

462
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,360
 And so when I got onto the bus, I was really thinking to myself, and I was praying at the

463
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,160
 same time, telling God, "Thank you.

464
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:19,400
 Thank you for allowing me to be carrying her burden just a little bit.

465
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,000
 Thank you for allowing me to be there."

466
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,320
 And then as I was just, you know, the bus taking off, I thought about that old man.

467
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:39,720
 I thought about the old man, and I just thought, "Did nobody take notice of his sadness?

468
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,400
 Did nobody care about how he was doing?"

469
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:51,640
 Because he actually committed suicide at two in the afternoon.

470
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
 And I thought about that.

471
00:32:53,640 --> 00:33:00,520
 And I also thought, "Did he not develop any friendships in the small group that was deep

472
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:11,040
 enough and safe enough for him to call at that moment when he couldn't take it anymore?"

473
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:17,880
 And I just kept on thinking about the old man, and I thought, "What if somebody took

474
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,760
 notice of him?

475
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,360
 Would things have been different?

476
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:31,160
 What if somebody took an extra 15 minutes and sat with him?"

477
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:36,600
 And I thought, "Oh, were they all kind of like me, who was trying to catch the earlier

478
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,520
 bus and was in such a rush?

479
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,320
 Maybe they had to go home to cook for their kids.

480
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,760
 Maybe they have to prepare their homework.

481
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,080
 And maybe there were so many other things.

482
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:58,360
 Maybe they were even preparing for next week's Sunday school materials."

483
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:05,400
 And so as we, as I was on the bus and going home, I really thought to myself, I thought

484
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,560
 that today I actually didn't write a sermon.

485
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,920
 I actually got to live out a sermon.

486
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:23,400
 And I realized I didn't do it at all, because in my flesh, I was going to catch that earlier

487
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,120
 bus.

488
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:33,200
 But it was in the spirit that allowed me to partner with God in that moment to carry someone's

489
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,440
 burden.

490
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,880
 Of course, I would always wonder if someone had carried that old man's burden, had spent

491
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,000
 an extra few minutes there, what would have happened?

492
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,560
 But nobody would know.

493
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,880
 And so I really reflected thinking about all this, and I think that's fulfilling God's

494
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,320
 law when he says, "Bear each other's burden."

495
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,960
 Because I felt that on the day, God helped me to love her, which was somebody that was

496
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,600
 on God's heart.

497
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:14,760
 And so today, my friends, I wanted to say that God's not asking us to do something very,

498
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,040
 very hard.

499
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:22,880
 He's not asking us to part the Red Sea or to walk on water, but he is asking us to bear

500
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,840
 one another's burden.

501
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,820
 And how can we do that?

502
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:32,960
 And for some of us, it might just be not catching this bus, but the next one, so that I can

503
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,240
 have an open ear and pray.

504
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:41,020
 And for others, it might be that we'll all chip in, and then we'll help with some medical

505
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,320
 bills of someone.

506
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,920
 And for others even more, it might just be giving that new person, that welcome of new

507
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,460
 people today, just welcoming that person.

508
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:59,560
 Maybe they're going through some hard things too, and just saying, "Wait, what has been

509
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,160
 on your mind lately?"

510
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:08,560
 And that would have helped to carry one another's burden.

511
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:18,260
 And so I just wanted to close today to say that God didn't meant for us to be alone.

512
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:24,100
 He meant for us to be in a community, and our faith is not meant that God saved us so

513
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
 we can enjoy a comfortable...

514
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:31,980
 Well, we are very comfortable still, but not to only enjoy a comfortable Christian life,

515
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:39,220
 but he has asked us, has called us to be his vessels, because we have been broken before,

516
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,580
 and yet he has redeemed us.

517
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:46,360
 And he's asking us to extend the same amount of love to others.

518
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,640
 And we do wanna do that.

519
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:57,740
 And so I don't know who's here or even watching our Facebook videos, maybe there's something

520
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:01,040
 on your heart that you're struggling with.

521
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,780
 I just wanted to say that it's okay to tell us about it.

522
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:11,940
 It's okay that we walk together and bear each other's burden, because we were meant to,

523
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,440
 God asked us to.

524
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,020
 And so if that's you, please come and tell us.

525
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:23,860
 And for us who are the ones that are able to bear others, let's stay alert, let's look

526
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,860
 around.

527
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:31,420
 I mean, not like a detective, okay, but really to pay attention, to see, has anybody, even

528
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,940
 though they've been coming to church every week, even though they seem to have a smiley

529
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,140
 face, what's happening with that person?

530
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:45,880
 Let us take initiative and go and really see how other people are doing.

531
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:54,120
 And so I'm just praying that God is helping us along the way to do all these things, which

532
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:59,900
 is to bear one another's burden in his spirit, in the way that he would do it.

533
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:05,400
 And at the same time, check our hearts all the time, and also for us to learn that we

534
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,200
 need one another.

535
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:16,020
 And so we'll ask the worship band to come and we'll pray together, that really for us

536
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,900
 to know how we can serve our King, how we can be a vessel to him in different times

537
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,840
 of the day, in different ways that we might not even have thought of.

538
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,720
 So let's pray together.

539
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:37,460
 Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for saving us.

540
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:45,140
 You have so many brokenness and weaknesses, and yet in Jesus, you have made us new, you

541
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,000
 have made us whole.

542
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,260
 And Father, we thank you for this spiritual community that we have, that we can lean on

543
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,260
 one another.

544
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,720
 We don't have to be by ourselves.

545
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,980
 You have given us a spirit that lives inside of us, and you've also given people around

546
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:07,780
 us so that we can love one another, we can bear each other's burdens.

547
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:14,020
 And Father, we're just praying that whenever you want us to be your vessel, that whenever

548
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:24,180
 you want us to have a pair of listening ears, or just to walk alongside with someone, or

549
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:29,660
 that we can pay for something that people need.

550
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:35,660
 Father, whatever that may be, I pray that your spirit stirs in us, so that in the moment

551
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:41,060
 when you want to do something, Father, that we're right there to partner with you.

552
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,300
 We know that this is a gift that you've given us.

553
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,820
 It is a blessing that we're able to bear one another's burden.

554
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:55,780
 And so Father, we thank you for this honor, and we thank you that you have saved us.

555
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,500
 And this is the beginning of everything.

556
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,660
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.

557
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,100
