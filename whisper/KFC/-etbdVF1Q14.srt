1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 - Okay, it's wonderful to be here with you.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,540
 I'm just gonna take a while, get organized here.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,680
 Flip this off and just to say what an honor it is

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,000
 to be with you tonight and to hear John.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,880
 John looked like he was having a good time on the beach,

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,520
 but it looked a bit cold to me.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,620
 If I go to the beach, I like to be a little warmer than that.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,520
 So anyway, it's great to be here.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,160
 I was trying to, Mary and I were trying to remember

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,200
 the last time we were here,

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,560
 but it was within the first couple of years of the church.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,560
 And just to see the impact that Kung Fu Church International

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,800
 and Kung Fu Church have had together

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,800
 on the one movement all across Hong Kong is really inspiring.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,680
 So it's an honor to be here.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,880
 And I guess tonight really my hope is that I can come

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,920
 and together we can encourage one another

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,480
 to keep joining together.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,640
 If there are any divisions among us in the city,

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,860
 if there's any divisions among us in our workplaces,

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,640
 if there's any divisions among us in the church,

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,840
 that those we can overcome with this heart

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,060
 of bridge building.

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,440
 So that's my desire tonight.

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,700
 And thank you for that prayer, Michelle.

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,520
 Thank you for praying for us.

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,120
 And so Michelle kicked off the series last week

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,860
 with identifying what are the main issues

29
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,880
 that are in 1 Corinthians.

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,800
 And my job is to kind of then step into that.

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,280
 I think the official title was party spirit,

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,280
 but it's basically looking at the different divisions

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,420
 that can rise up among us.

34
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,960
 As Michelle said, or as we were talking,

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,960
 I came here to Hong Kong to be a senior pastor

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,180
 at Community Church.

37
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,880
 Before that, we were pastoring churches in the UK

38
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,520
 and also in Germany.

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,840
 And so for about 22 years, I've been a pastor.

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,840
 And at one of those churches, we designed a little booklet.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,800
 And this booklet was called

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,120
 "How to Resolve Conflict in a Biblical Fashion."

43
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,920
 So how to resolve conflict in a biblical fashion.

44
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,120
 And the very first sentence of this booklet was,

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,120
 "It is normal when we are together to experience conflict."

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,040
 And the booklet was very well received.

47
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,720
 And so we thought, this is well received,

48
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,720
 so we're gonna go ahead and put it up on our webpage.

49
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,920
 And so we did that.

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,840
 And then somehow in the mysteries of Google,

51
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,120
 which I don't fully understand,

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,760
 Google took it and took that phrase

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,760
 that when it is normal when we are together

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,980
 to have conflict, put that next to our church name,

55
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,120
 and that's how people identified us.

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,880
 It was, here we are, come to our church.

57
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,440
 It is normal when we are together to have conflict.

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,120
 Okay, not very good marketing,

59
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,880
 but it is kind of normal, right?

60
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,740
 It is normal when people are together

61
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,180
 that over time we can expect some conflict

62
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,760
 because people are messy, right?

63
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,560
 And I'm one of them.

64
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,200
 And as we get into relationships,

65
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,600
 sometimes those relationships can get messy.

66
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,000
 And that's what Michelle was identifying last week

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,480
 in her second point of the ministry of Paul

68
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,360
 was that there was a call from Paul for unity.

69
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,320
 There was a call from Paul to come together

70
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,200
 and to overcome these groups.

71
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,640
 So what I'm gonna do tonight is basically

72
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,200
 just look at what that might look like

73
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,680
 to go a little bit deeper in that area.

74
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,720
 And I'd like to do that really by looking at three words.

75
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,840
 I think we're there.

76
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,520
 Oops.

77
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,760
 You definitely do not want me to sing to you.

78
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,840
 So maybe we can go to the slides and then we can look at it.

79
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,720
 If we could go to that first slide, the title slide.

80
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,560
 But basically we're gonna look at these three words.

81
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,960
 The three words when they come up are basically tribe.

82
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,280
 And then we're gonna look at priest.

83
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,480
 And then after priest, we're gonna look at

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,040
 what does it mean for the heart?

85
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,280
 So those are the three words we're gonna use

86
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,280
 to look at this question of the heart of a servant.

87
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,320
 Good, so here we are.

88
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,360
 So tribe, priest, and heart.

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,720
 So I wanna read to you a little bit.

90
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,760
 This is not like a bedtime reading or anything like that.

91
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,240
 But I wanna read to you a little bit

92
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,200
 from an author named Amy Chua.

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,240
 Do you know Amy Chua?

94
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,600
 Does that ring a bell at all?

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,560
 Amy Chua is at Yale.

96
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,240
 She's part of their legal, part of their law school there.

97
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,280
 She's written these amazing academic books,

98
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,680
 but she's best known for a book called "Tiger Mom."

99
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,360
 And this is not "Tiger Mom."

100
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,920
 I'm not gonna read from "Tiger Mom."

101
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,040
 But about four years ago, 2018,

102
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,840
 she became very concerned about all of the groups

103
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,000
 that were forming in our world.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,180
 And she became very concerned about the polarization,

105
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,680
 not only in the US, but around the world.

106
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,680
 So she wrote a book about tribes.

107
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,360
 And this is how that book starts.

108
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,040
 It says, "Humans are tribal.

109
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,840
 "We need to belong to groups.

110
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,540
 "We crave bonds and attachments,

111
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,340
 "which is why we love clubs and teams

112
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,640
 "and fraternities and family.

113
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,720
 "Almost no one is a hermit.

114
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,640
 "Even monks and friars belong to orders.

115
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,640
 "But the tribal instinct is not just an instinct to belong.

116
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:48,260
 "It also is an instinct to exclude.

117
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:54,580
 "The tribal instinct is not only an instinct to belong,

118
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,780
 "but it's an instinct to exclude."

119
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,100
 Now, hear how Paul starts his section that we read tonight.

120
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,040
 For when one says, "I follow Paul,"

121
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,240
 and another says, "I follow Apollo,"

122
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,920
 are you not mere humans?

123
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,400
 Or in the other translation, human beings.

124
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,560
 In other words, there's an instinct, right?

125
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,880
 And I recognize that instinct in me.

126
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,840
 When I was reading this,

127
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,480
 I follow Paul, I follow Apollos,

128
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,260
 kind of made me think about some years ago

129
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,640
 when we went to visit New York City.

130
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,880
 And I was so excited to go to New York City

131
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,520
 to hear Tim Keller preach in person, right?

132
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,960
 So I thought, "This is gonna be great."

133
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,280
 So much so that one of our oldest daughter

134
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,680
 was kind of thinking I was like a fangirl or something,

135
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,120
 like, "Timmy, I'm gonna hear him," right?

136
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,880
 But it was exciting, right?

137
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,720
 And I recognize that in me.

138
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,060
 But I know that Timmy, or Tim Keller,

139
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,060
 is at his best when he is pointing people to Jesus Christ.

140
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,500
 And he's often, if not almost always,

141
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,020
 at his best as he does that.

142
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,740
 But there's something in us, right?

143
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,740
 There's something in us that wants to group together,

144
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,100
 which is not bad.

145
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,380
 Michelle did a great job kind of laying this out last week

146
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,660
 about unity and diversity.

147
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,300
 But to have groups is not always bad, right?

148
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,820
 One of my colleagues at the university,

149
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,140
 he loves durian, right?

150
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,840
 I, on the other hand,

151
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,000
 well, it's not my favorite, right?

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,020
 But we get along fine.

153
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,660
 Hope I didn't offend any durian lovers in here or whatever.

154
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,780
 But yeah, that's just, it doesn't really matter, right?

155
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,560
 It's not a group that matters.

156
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,100
 But there are other groups

157
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,460
 where then it begins to be divisive.

158
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,980
 It begins to be exclusive.

159
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,180
 My mom had a gift of hospitality.

160
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,380
 And growing up, we had a big table.

161
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,700
 And the whole, the phrase that we would hear

162
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,740
 again and again from her is,

163
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,100
 "There's always room for one more at the table."

164
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,380
 But see, there's some groups which says,

165
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,420
 "You can't sit at this table."

166
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,740
 And when the groups become divisive like that,

167
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,460
 when the groups become exclusive,

168
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,140
 and we say, "You, because of who you are,

169
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,980
 "are not welcomed here,"

170
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,940
 then we begin to fall into what Paul is addressing here,

171
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,000
 the group of Apollos, the group of Paul.

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,380
 And sometimes we even add colors to them, don't we?

173
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,420
 And we begin to give colors like blue and like yellow

174
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,420
 and like red and like black and like green

175
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,220
 and like white.

176
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,420
 And we give these colors to these groups.

177
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,960
 And then it becomes divisive.

178
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,620
 And it becomes exclusive.

179
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,700
 And then the oneness, the unity,

180
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,100
 which we talked about last week, begins to fall apart.

181
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,780
 That's what I'm gonna talk about tonight,

182
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,780
 is to focus on that because it's not only out there, right?

183
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
 We know it to be in the church.

184
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,320
 We know it to always be a design of the devil

185
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,440
 to try to create different groups in a church.

186
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,640
 So we're always on guard,

187
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,040
 as Paul was on guard saying, "This is Apollos."

188
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,120
 Okay, so is that clear?

189
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,000
 That's kind of where we're gonna be addressing.

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,800
 And we're gonna be talking right at it.

191
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,960
 That was the tribes.

192
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,960
 But in the tribes, then there is a work to be done

193
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,120
 to be done.

194
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,920
 There's a work that we can do within the church.

195
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,080
 And in this area, then we come to look at the priests,

196
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,540
 the priest role.

197
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,440
 So the work that we do is of the priest.

198
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,920
 And here we need to let Scripture interpret Scripture, right?

199
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,320
 Because Paul is talking about this division.

200
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,320
 And then he says, "There is a work that we do,

201
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,720
 "for we are God's fellow workers," he's saying.

202
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,000
 Now, take a moment and just kind of breathe that in

203
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,040
 a little bit, right?

204
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,920
 To be a fellow worker of God.

205
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,580
 Okay, so think about your work.

206
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:39,880
 And to imagine that you are working alongside of God.

207
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,720
 The Greek word here is syn-ergo,

208
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,080
 which is literally working together with God.

209
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,800
 Not just doing work for God

210
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,160
 and calling on His help occasionally,

211
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,080
 but to be working alongside God.

212
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,840
 This is the work that we're called to.

213
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,560
 Now, to make this teaching really practical,

214
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,960
 what I'd like you to do is to imagine with me.

215
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,720
 Maybe not imagine, but just think with me for a little bit

216
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,760
 about divisive groups that you know.

217
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,320
 Maybe they're in your workplace.

218
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,680
 Maybe there's two groups.

219
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,080
 Before I became a pastor,

220
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,820
 I was in marketing with Accenture.

221
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
 There was always the marketing and the finance,

222
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,480
 because marketing wanted to spend a lot of money,

223
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,920
 finance didn't, and that's kind of how that worked.

224
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,060
 Maybe groups in your workplace.

225
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,400
 Are there two groups there?

226
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,840
 Maybe they're groups among your student groups.

227
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,720
 Maybe they're groups in your family.

228
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,700
 Maybe they're groups in the church.

229
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,720
 And just think about that for a moment.

230
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,280
 Does everybody have something in mind?

231
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,120
 Yeah?

232
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,320
 This is kind of a hard sermon for a Saturday night, isn't it?

233
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,440
 I mean, it's like, wow, okay.

234
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,800
 I want you to have that in mind,

235
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,520
 because then I think we can apply the word of God to it,

236
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,880
 and we can apply the work of the priest.

237
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,960
 So then we have to ask ourselves,

238
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,960
 if we are God's fellow workers, what is the work we do?

239
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,920
 And the work we do is the work of the priest.

240
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,240
 We are called to be priests.

241
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,840
 Peter, one of the best friends of Jesus,

242
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,080
 said you are called, you are a royal priesthood,

243
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,400
 you are a holy priesthood.

244
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,740
 The reformers said the priesthood of all believers.

245
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,000
 You may have heard the priesthood

246
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,380
 of all believers quite a lot.

247
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,100
 You may have said that about yourself,

248
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,920
 but what is the work of the priest?

249
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,640
 And that's what we're gonna look at now.

250
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,640
 Pontifex is the Latin for priest.

251
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,880
 This is a Saturday night,

252
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,480
 so it's great to have Latin on a Saturday night, right?

253
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,280
 So my mom, in addition to being very hospitable,

254
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,200
 also loved Latin.

255
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,720
 Latin was one of her passions.

256
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,840
 There was really no problem that was too big

257
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,800
 that could not be solved with Latin in her mind, right?

258
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,080
 But pontifex means priest.

259
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,920
 That's what you are.

260
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,760
 If you say you're the priesthood of believers,

261
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
 you're a pontifex.

262
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,400
 And what is a pontifex?

263
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,400
 Ponte is bridge, fex is to make, facer, to make.

264
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,200
 It's basically that's what we are.

265
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
 That's your work.

266
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,660
 That's my work.

267
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:25,340
 Maybe a bad news is there's tribes out there.

268
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,780
 The good news is that we are a tribe of bridge builders.

269
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,040
 That's what we do.

270
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,480
 We come as priest and we begin to build bridges.

271
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,040
 We begin to look at what does it mean

272
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,560
 to build the bridges together.

273
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,920
 So think about bridges.

274
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,760
 What is a bridge, right?

275
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,360
 Think about Stonecutter Bridge or Singma Bridge.

276
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,460
 What does a bridge do?

277
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,080
 It connects.

278
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,040
 What does it connect?

279
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,160
 Yeah, it connects one thing to another, right?

280
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,240
 It's two points.

281
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,040
 Often one side of a river to another side of the river,

282
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,840
 one to whatever, a chasm.

283
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,260
 It's a bridge that brings things together.

284
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,560
 That's what a bridge does, right?

285
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,560
 Okay, you still have that image of that group in your mind

286
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,640
 that were apart?

287
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,320
 What does a bridge look like connecting those?

288
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,040
 Or let's be a little bit more specific.

289
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,920
 What do you look like as a bridge maker

290
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
 connecting those two?

291
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,320
 What would that look like to be a bridge builder

292
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,280
 in that area and to begin to build bridges,

293
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,600
 to connect people, to do the priestly work

294
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,100
 that Christ himself came to do?

295
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,880
 Jesus was the ultimate bridge builder, right?

296
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,440
 Because he connected us with the Father.

297
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,720
 He came into the gap and filled that gap vertically.

298
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,360
 And that's what we can do.

299
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,440
 As bridge builders, we can build vertical bridges

300
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,900
 to God for others and build them so strong and so safe

301
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,000
 that people can feel they can want

302
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,400
 to go into the arms of God.

303
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,400
 But we can also build horizontal bridges.

304
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,680
 And we can begin to build into these groups.

305
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,640
 So there's no longer groups, but they're connected.

306
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,720
 And the people are traveling back and forth on that groups.

307
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,560
 That is what you and I are called to do.

308
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,200
 This is what we do as a group.

309
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,640
 We are doing this work together.

310
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,740
 So this is the bridge builder.

311
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,720
 This is the work we do.

312
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,260
 But as we go on, I wanna talk to you a little bit

313
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,680
 about a bridge building that we've been a part of, okay?

314
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,560
 Because this is a picture.

315
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
 See if I can get out of the way here.

316
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,000
 It's actually quite big here.

317
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,240
 But you can see this picture.

318
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,880
 This is a Lead for Life program.

319
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,080
 This is what we work on at Faith and Global Engagement.

320
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,360
 It's an area that I work in.

321
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,400
 It's a character leadership program.

322
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,400
 We have 200, basically 249 students in this cohort,

323
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,600
 and we have about 180 in the first one.

324
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,700
 So over 400 students involved in two cohorts.

325
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,360
 We also have 84 mentors.

326
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,240
 This happened last Sunday night.

327
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,480
 So this just happened as we launched this off.

328
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,280
 Now, the reason I wanted to show you this

329
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,640
 is there's a traditional conflict

330
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,920
 or a grouping called town gown.

331
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,280
 You heard of that?

332
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,600
 Right, just town gown.

333
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,320
 So right from the beginning,

334
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,640
 Oxford starting up in the universities,

335
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,800
 there was always tension where there was a university

336
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,660
 and there was a town.

337
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,960
 So much so that historians called it

338
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,640
 the town gown conflict, right?

339
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,200
 We've experienced that here in Hong Kong

340
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,360
 at different times, right?

341
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,160
 Conflict sometimes between what's going on

342
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,640
 in the universities and what's going on in the town.

343
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,120
 Groups.

344
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,400
 And so one of the things we wanted to do

345
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,920
 at Lead for Life and its character leadership

346
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,000
 is to say, let's bring both together.

347
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,380
 The gowns are pretty obvious here, right?

348
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,340
 These are our students,

349
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,880
 and the students come from every faculty

350
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,160
 in University of Hong Kong.

351
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,160
 But the 84 mentors are leaders in all different categories,

352
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,360
 all different sectors in Hong Kong,

353
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,200
 and they volunteer to come in

354
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
 and to come alongside our students for one year.

355
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,360
 And then the mentors get,

356
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,440
 and then the students stay together for another year,

357
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,880
 and they get another two set of mentors.

358
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,560
 The student group will stay together all four years.

359
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,880
 It's just our kind of little way

360
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,760
 of trying to bridge a gap.

361
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,500
 This is the mentor group,

362
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,960
 and you can barely see our mentor right here, right?

363
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,640
 You can just barely see the top of his head,

364
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,720
 but this is the group.

365
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
 The group is called Curiosity.

366
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,360
 This is the mentee group.

367
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,160
 And I love it how you can barely see the mentor

368
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,640
 because that's the purpose, right?

369
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,300
 The purpose is that we see the students.

370
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,760
 This is something that I wanted to give you

371
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,480
 as just a small example of pontifex,

372
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,620
 of bridge building, of trying to do what we can.

373
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,080
 So what does yours look like?

374
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,680
 What does yours look like as you begin to think

375
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,600
 about how I would build that bridge

376
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,520
 between these two groups,

377
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,140
 and what would be some steps we could take,

378
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,320
 and who you're going to do it with, right?

379
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,240
 Because this is not done by one person.

380
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,680
 This is done by a team.

381
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,320
 And when you build bridges,

382
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,220
 you work together to build those teams.

383
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,960
 Now, when we do this, we're coming on to the third word.

384
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,960
 Okay, but before I go on, is this making sense, right?

385
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,280
 Or is this following?

386
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,040
 So, okay, we've got groups, right?

387
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,640
 And then we need to bring those groups together

388
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,800
 because that's who we are.

389
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,120
 We're the priesthood of believers.

390
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,280
 That's our job.

391
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,800
 It's a family business, really.

392
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,240
 The father was a bridge builder, right?

393
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,600
 And he gave to the son to be the bridge builder

394
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,800
 in terms of Jesus Christ,

395
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,240
 and has been passed on generation,

396
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,520
 and generation, and generation.

397
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,720
 And now this whole room,

398
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,600
 we're filled with bridge builders, right?

399
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,260
 And so, what does it mean to do that?

400
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,960
 Now, before we go on,

401
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,280
 I'm just gonna give you this example

402
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,360
 to maybe kind of help us kind of see

403
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,480
 where we are in reflecting.

404
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,720
 Because what we're doing right now

405
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,520
 is we're doing the tough work

406
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,780
 of we're addressing potential issues or real issues

407
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,520
 in our work, in our families,

408
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,960
 maybe in our churches and in our friend group, right?

409
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,040
 But we're reflecting on it.

410
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,840
 Now, at the Lead for Life group,

411
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,800
 we've got this amazing head of research.

412
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,940
 He's also the project manager

413
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,840
 for Faith and Global Engagement, Hua Lun.

414
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,800
 And he does the reflection of how to reflect.

415
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,200
 And this is a good model.

416
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,040
 If you're thinking about

417
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,760
 how I wanna reflect on a scripture passage,

418
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,420
 how I wanna reflect on a problem,

419
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,960
 how I wanna reflect on really anything,

420
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,980
 this is kind of an iceberg metaphor to do that, right?

421
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,620
 So the very top of this is a hmm.

422
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,380
 And when Hua Lun teaches us this,

423
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,620
 he basically has us all do it together, right?

424
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,860
 So he says, first of all, we go hmm,

425
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,780
 that's interesting, right?

426
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,180
 That's what the hmm means.

427
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,860
 That means you come across something

428
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,760
 and you think hmm, that's interesting.

429
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,460
 Hmm, that's interesting that humans

430
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,200
 seem to have an instinct for tribalism.

431
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,840
 Hmm, that's interesting, right?

432
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,320
 But we don't stop there, right?

433
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
 Because we've gotta go a little bit further down.

434
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,200
 And then we go to the ah.

435
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,040
 You guys are really good.

436
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,680
 I'm gonna bring you over to the campus

437
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
 and have you guys do this.

438
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,040
 So we go to the ah.

439
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,380
 And ah means ah, that's useful.

440
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,600
 Bridge building, I'm a bridge builder.

441
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,240
 That's useful, I can build bridges.

442
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,320
 That's useful, ah.

443
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,360
 That's where we are right now in this sermon,

444
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,520
 just so we're tracking in.

445
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,040
 But you can see that we've really

446
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,600
 only stayed at the surface level.

447
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,360
 And now we need to go down to this big part.

448
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,200
 Now don't get scared.

449
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,940
 It's not like the rest of the sermon is much bigger.

450
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,440
 But now we need to go deeper.

451
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,760
 Now we go to the ah-ha.

452
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
 Right, and you know that?

453
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,100
 You know that's an ah-ha moment, right?

454
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,100
 So we go from the hmm to the ah-ha.

455
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:28,240
 Means this is relevant for me.

456
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,680
 Means there's something in here for me.

457
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,100
 This is interesting, it's useful, but it's for me.

458
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,640
 That's why it's the heart.

459
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,560
 So you guys ready to go a little deeper?

460
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,720
 Okay, so we're gonna go a little bit deeper

461
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,560
 because now we're actually looking at really what matters.

462
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:56,020
 Jesus said out of the heart flows what a person is, right?

463
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,420
 The mouth speaks overflow of what is out of the heart.

464
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,820
 Jesus was always looking at the heart.

465
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,480
 When the groups, and he dealt with groups

466
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,780
 from the Pharisees to the Sadducees to the Essenes,

467
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,420
 and when he dealt with those groups,

468
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,440
 he said, it was often said, he knew their heart, right?

469
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,680
 So that's where we're going.

470
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,820
 We're going down to the heart.

471
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,340
 And this is what Paul says.

472
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,740
 He's just finished talking about himself as a leader,

473
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,300
 and he's saying, don't follow me, follow Jesus Christ,

474
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,580
 because then he says, what after all is Apollos,

475
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,040
 and what is Paul?

476
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,240
 We're only servants.

477
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,900
 Okay, now we're getting down to the identity of who we are.

478
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,560
 Now we're getting down to, do we have the heart of a servant?

479
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:50,160
 Do we want to build that bridge?

480
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,080
 Do we want to make that connection?

481
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,800
 Are we willing to serve?

482
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,160
 And then when we look at the heart of the servant,

483
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
 we begin to ask a question,

484
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,480
 what is the heart of a servant, right?

485
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,960
 So again, it's a problem.

486
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,160
 So every good problem can be solved with Latin.

487
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,100
 So now we're back to this, and I promise,

488
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,160
 this is the last Latin in the whole,

489
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,160
 but humility is the characteristic

490
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,000
 of a heart of a servant.

491
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,120
 But what is humility?

492
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,720
 It comes from this humilis, it comes from the ground,

493
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,520
 it comes from dirt, really.

494
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,540
 Not that we are treated ourselves like dirt,

495
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,320
 but we are grounded.

496
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,320
 We are so grounded, we are not swayed by every wind

497
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,120
 of what people think about us,

498
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,640
 because we know who we are.

499
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,920
 We take in the tradition our rightful space.

500
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,060
 We don't take more, or that would be arrogance.

501
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,600
 We don't take less, or that would be not grateful to God.

502
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,320
 But we are grounded as servants.

503
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,320
 We have this humus, we have this groundedness to us.

504
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,820
 But then there's something else, because there's a core.

505
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,080
 That's the heart, that's the Latin for heart.

506
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,720
 So we have a humble heart, but the heart itself

507
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,200
 is where we get the word courage.

508
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,120
 So what's in your heart as a bridge builder?

509
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,380
 And do we have that humility, and do we have that courage?

510
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,820
 Because we need both if we're gonna be bridge builders,

511
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,000
 because we need the humility to recognize

512
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,960
 there is a problem, and we also need to have the humility

513
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,300
 to recognize that I may be part of that problem.

514
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,400
 But then we need the courage to act.

515
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,300
 It's wisdom is applied knowledge.

516
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,960
 We can know it and not do anything,

517
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,360
 but we need that courage, right?

518
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,200
 So that courage to act.

519
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,600
 So I'll give you an example.

520
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,640
 Recently, I was convicted by God, by the Holy Spirit,

521
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,440
 and it's been going on for some time,

522
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,320
 but I recently acted on it,

523
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,060
 of a bridge that I needed to build.

524
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,620
 A bridge that had been severed.

525
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:14,620
 A group that I needed to reach out and build a bridge.

526
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,780
 And by the grace of God, through the humility

527
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,620
 that is a grace, then I could recognize

528
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,660
 that I need to do something, and I am part of it.

529
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,900
 Now, you have to have the courage, right?

530
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,820
 Because you can know that, but you've gotta get on the MTR

531
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,180
 and go to that person, or to that whatever, right?

532
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,500
 You've gotta do it.

533
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
 And so recently I did.

534
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,140
 Felt it, got on the MTR, went to the place

535
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,540
 where we were going to meet,

536
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:50,740
 walked around several times before I went into the place,

537
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,960
 get a little bit of courage, and went in.

538
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,900
 What about you?

539
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,500
 In your humility, and by the grace of God,

540
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,520
 when you thought of those two groups,

541
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,260
 what's your part in it?

542
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,300
 You might really not be a part at all.

543
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,740
 That might be one of the giftings, is to come together,

544
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,580
 but it might be that you have a part.

545
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,060
 But what's the part of humility that you then act on,

546
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,900
 encourage, and to step out?

547
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,340
 That becomes, then, the heart.

548
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,900
 Now we're way below the surface, right?

549
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,460
 And now we're really looking at individually who we are.

550
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,460
 And when we do that, I wanna say something very clearly.

551
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,460
 Don't go into the bridge-building business.

552
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,100
 Don't go into the bridge-building work

553
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,240
 without building that foundation on Jesus Christ.

554
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,900
 And this is how Paul finishes this part of the text.

555
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,420
 "For no one can lay any foundation

556
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:02,340
 "other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ."

557
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,380
 Jesus knows about those groups

558
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,380
 that you were picturing in your mind,

559
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,400
 and his heart most likely is broken, as maybe yours is.

560
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,220
 But he's also laying a foundation.

561
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,980
 Did you know that bridges have foundations?

562
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,820
 Yeah, you're kinda nodding like,

563
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,460
 "That's very obvious, Steve, yes." (laughs)

564
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,900
 It wasn't obvious for me so much,

565
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,500
 'cause Paul here is talking about foundations

566
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,060
 in terms of a building, right?

567
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,100
 And we all think of that, but bridges have foundations too.

568
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,540
 In fact, when the architect and the engineer work together,

569
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,780
 then there's at least seven different types of foundations

570
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,300
 they could put into that bridge,

571
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,020
 depending on the terrain of what they need to do,

572
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,320
 and there's probably more.

573
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,100
 Priestly perspective, not an engineering perspective

574
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,220
 or an architecture perspective,

575
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,300
 but from a priestly perspective,

576
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,340
 there's only one foundation that we build on,

577
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,380
 and that is Jesus Christ.

578
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,340
 There is only one bridge builder that we follow,

579
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,640
 the one who came down and, as I said before,

580
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,900
 made that vertical bridge that any one of us tonight,

581
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,220
 if there is a broken bridge between you and God,

582
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,060
 or if there never really has been a direct connection,

583
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,320
 then Jesus says, "I'm here."

584
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,220
 And he also yearns for your neighbor,

585
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,260
 because Jesus didn't say, "Love the Lord your God

586
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,180
 "with all your heart, soul, mind, and body, full stop."

587
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,220
 He said, "Love the Lord your God

588
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,600
 "with your heart, soul, mind, and body,

589
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,580
 "and love your neighbor as yourself."

590
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,180
 This is the great commandment, singular.

591
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:50,180
 So the bridges, again, go vertically and horizontally,

592
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,420
 and that's the cross.

593
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,020
 And so look for the cross in 1 Corinthians.

594
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,680
 You'll find the cross coming up,

595
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,440
 Paul mentioning it again and again.

596
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,460
 That's the bridge building.

597
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,020
 That's what brings us all together.

598
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,340
 For no one can lay any foundation

599
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,980
 other than that of Jesus Christ, amen?

600
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:20,020
 Are we still on?

601
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,940
 Yeah, okay, so we're gonna close here.

602
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,260
 I thought maybe the sound booth was telling me,

603
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,860
 "Okay, it's time, we're cutting you."

604
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,700
 (audience laughing)

605
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,900
 You're done, so.

606
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:32,900
 We wanna close with a song, and we want,

607
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,100
 I'm not gonna sing, but we wanna close with a song,

608
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
 and we wanna close with a prayer.

609
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,380
 But before we do that, I think,

610
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,540
 do we have a few minutes, Michelle?

611
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,660
 Okay, any thoughts, questions?

612
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,900
 Is that ringing true?

613
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,900
 Is that resonating, maybe, with where we are?

614
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,580
 You're being very polite, that's good.

615
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,100
 Okay, good, no, no, no,

616
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,380
 but is there any questions in that?

617
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,900
 Any things when you're thinking about that,

618
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
 you think, "How does that actually work?"

619
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,500
 You ready to do some bridge building?

620
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,020
 Feel a little bit scared?

621
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:15,140
 It's okay, you know, courage,

622
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,620
 the definition of courage is overcoming fear.

623
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,140
 If you don't have fear, you don't have courage.

624
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,140
 If you're in a perfect world, you don't need courage.

625
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,660
 You only need courage when there's something to overcome.

626
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,180
 So it's okay to feel that fear, but we have that courage.

627
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,180
 Okay, so let's do this.

628
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,980
 Rather than talk to me, let's talk to God.

629
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,820
 That'll probably be much more useful.

630
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,700
 So we're gonna do this.

631
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,900
 We're gonna have a song that we're gonna close in,

632
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,380
 but before we go into the song, I wanna give us a prayer.

633
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,740
 It's a very simple prayer.

634
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,340
 And it's a prayer, whoops.

635
00:30:52,340 --> 00:31:02,060
 It's a prayer about humility.

636
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,540
 It's about a servant's heart.

637
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:10,540
 And it's a prayer a mentor taught me many years ago.

638
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,220
 And it's a very simple prayer.

639
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,540
 You can say it in less than a second.

640
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,500
 And so I wanna offer that prayer to you

641
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,020
 because I feel like that in this prayer,

642
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,780
 it's something for some of us.

643
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,940
 May not be for all of us,

644
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,900
 but there's something for some of us.

645
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,340
 But the song I also want us to be thinking about.

646
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,100
 So as the band is playing,

647
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:36,060
 then the song we're gonna sing is Christ is enough, right?

648
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,220
 Is he?

649
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,860
 You know?

650
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,180
 Yes, he is.

651
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,540
 But we need to confirm that and affirm that.

652
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,300
 So when we're hearing that song,

653
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,860
 it is Christ is enough.

654
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,140
 His foundation is enough for the bridge

655
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,060
 you're going to build or are building.

656
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,380
 Many of you are already way ahead of me

657
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,140
 in building those bridges.

658
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,980
 But there's something else.

659
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,220
 You know, right in the middle, there's that beautiful part,

660
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,660
 I have decided to follow Jesus.

661
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,660
 Okay, that's Paul's answer to, I'm not following Apollos.

662
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,940
 I'm not following Cephas.

663
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,140
 I'm not following Paul even.

664
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,220
 We're following Jesus Christ.

665
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,300
 Okay, so here's the prayer.

666
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,700
 The prayer is this.

667
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,100
 Lord, bring me someone to serve today.

668
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,020
 Yeah, it's pretty simple, right?

669
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,260
 I have a little bit of fear and trembling

670
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,820
 every time I'm going to pray this prayer.

671
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,380
 There are people who won't pray this prayer.

672
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,700
 They don't believe that God answers prayer,

673
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,780
 but they're not gonna pray this prayer

674
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,780
 because they know he'll answer this, right?

675
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,180
 (audience laughing)

676
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,620
 And he does.

677
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,660
 And sometimes in beautiful ways, simple ways.

678
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,020
 If you're like me, you know, my day is kind of full, right?

679
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,140
 And so then you're thinking, if I pray that,

680
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,020
 what's gonna happen?

681
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,820
 And am I gonna, you know, and we imagine worst case scenarios

682
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,460
 and we're cleaning, you know.

683
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,260
 But our God is a gracious God.

684
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,420
 His grace is sufficient for you.

685
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,380
 So one of the first times I got back

686
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,140
 to praying this recently, I was just walking down

687
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,620
 by the Hotel Gen in that area.

688
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,340
 And there was a domestic worker

689
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,700
 who was looking for a Hotel Gen

690
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,300
 because they wanted to take something

691
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,660
 who was for a person there in quarantine.

692
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,900
 And this person was going up to everybody

693
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,140
 and everybody was saying, I don't know where it is.

694
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,380
 But I did know because we had,

695
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,140
 when our daughter had stayed in Hotel Gen

696
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,700
 and it was right there.

697
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,500
 And so she came over and I said, yeah, that's where it is.

698
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,540
 And she was very gracious and she went on.

699
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,100
 I feel like that was my service that day

700
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,900
 'cause I just prayed the prayer about 10 minutes before.

701
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,420
 It might be as simple as that.

702
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,820
 There are other times when I prayed that prayer

703
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,420
 which begins a much deeper journey.

704
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,340
 But let's do this.

705
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,060
 Let's pray the prayer and pray it together.

706
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,420
 So let's do that right now.

707
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:04,060
 So yeah, you may wanna just bow your head

708
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,300
 or close your eyes, give your neighbor a little bit of space.

709
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,660
 We'll pray a little bit.

710
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,580
 And I'd like to pray for you and over you.

711
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,940
 And as we're sitting here in silence,

712
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,260
 I thank you that you are here.

713
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,500
 None of us is here without a purpose.

714
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,540
 That God had a plan for us being here

715
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,420
 and he had a word for us.

716
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,180
 And we don't wanna miss that.

717
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,900
 So in our silence, we wanna say,

718
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:35,580
 God, if there's anything that you wanted me to hear,

719
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,420
 let me hear that.

720
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,100
 Or maybe you already know what it was

721
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,460
 and just go there in your conversation.

722
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,620
 And I pray that if there's anyone here

723
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,300
 who feels severed from God,

724
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,460
 who feels like the bridge has fallen down,

725
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,860
 who feels like they never really had a bridge,

726
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,340
 who feels somehow they're just distant from God.

727
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,780
 Michelle preached beautifully last week about directional.

728
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,980
 It's not how far or how close you are to God,

729
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,020
 it's which direction you're going.

730
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,580
 And you can turn and just start going back

731
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,820
 and you can pray to the bridge builder,

732
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:17,540
 Jesus Christ, connect me to God.

733
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,980
 And there are many here

734
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:29,660
 that did have a pretty clear image

735
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,620
 of the groups that they would love to bring together.

736
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,620
 And so pray for that, pray for them.

737
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,660
 Pray that you can be part of the bridge building exercise.

738
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:49,380
 And then through the power of the Holy Spirit,

739
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,980
 let the Holy Spirit pray this prayer through you.

740
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,980
 Lord, bring me someone to serve today, even today.

741
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:02,420
 And then pray it tomorrow.

742
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,820
 And then pray it tomorrow and the next day.

743
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,820
 It's a bridge builder's prayer.

744
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,580
 Lord, hear our prayer.

745
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:23,580
