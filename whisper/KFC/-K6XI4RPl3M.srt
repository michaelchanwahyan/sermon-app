1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 - Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 Let's just wave.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,640
 Yeah, it's great to be here.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,800
 Tonight we'll be continuing our series

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,920
 on women in the Old Testament.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,200
 So we've looked through a few stories already

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,240
 on Eve and Rebecca,

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,040
 and last week we looked at Leah and Rachel,

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,080
 and today we're gonna be looking at the life of Miriam.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,280
 Now, not a lot of women have been noted in the Bible.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,760
 Now, there are even fewer that has prominent roles,

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,760
 and yet Miriam was noted to be the very first prophetess

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,160
 in the Bible.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,880
 So there's a lot of things that we can learn about her,

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,720
 and today we'll be learning about how or what is it

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,320
 that it means to be faithful to God,

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,760
 and we're gonna learn actually both through her strengths

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,880
 as well as her weaknesses.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,240
 So what is, I mean, who is Miriam anyway?

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,240
 Well, she is better known as the sister of Moses and Aaron

21
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:11,720
 who led the Israelites out from Egypt into the Promised Land.

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,320
 So her name really means beloved

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,440
 if it's with the sound in Egypt,

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,520
 or the star of the sea,

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,120
 or sea of bitterness in the word Hebrew.

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,160
 And so we're gonna see a little bit

27
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,000
 of all of those characteristics playing out tonight.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,720
 And she came from a family of a priest,

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,200
 so she came from quite a godly family,

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,440
 or that's the context of it.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,320
 So now the first appearance of her in the Bible

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,760
 is actually in Exodus, verse two, one to 10.

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,480
 Now, at that time, she was actually the unnamed sister,

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,880
 so she's not given a name at that time,

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,240
 but with the process of elimination,

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,120
 Moses only had one sister, so we know that it's Miriam.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,440
 And so at that time, what happened

38
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,200
 was that the Israelites were oppressed

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,480
 and they were living in the land of Egypt,

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 and they were living actually as slaves.

41
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,320
 And so because their population grew so much

42
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,520
 that Pharaoh wanted to limit their numbers.

43
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,840
 So what he planned, or what he said is that

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,840
 to have all of the baby boys put to death when they're born,

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,640
 and that's the command that he gave

46
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,480
 to the midwives of the Hebrews.

47
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,360
 But the Hebrew midwives feared the Lord,

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,640
 so then they did not listen to him

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,200
 and instead allowed the baby boys to continue on.

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,880
 So Pharaoh found out that his plan wasn't working out,

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,600
 so instead he said, "Let's get all of the baby boys

52
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,440
 "and throw them into the Nile River

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,160
 "to be killed and drowned."

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,160
 And so this is the time when Moses was born.

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,400
 And so when he was born, he was kept for three months,

56
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,640
 and eventually his mother could no longer keep him

57
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
 'cause he was probably quite big.

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,320
 And so he put him in a basket,

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,320
 and then he put it among the reeds in the Nile River.

60
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,160
 And so this is the first account,

61
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,480
 and let's just read it together.

62
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,640
 I'll read it to you.

63
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,400
 This is in Exodus chapter 2, 78.

64
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,560
 It says here, "Then his sister," which is Miriam,

65
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,400
 "asked Pharaoh's daughter,"

66
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,400
 because the slave of Pharaoh's daughter found this basket,

67
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,680
 and she said, Miriam asked her,

68
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,680
 "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women

69
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,880
 "to nurse the baby for you?"

70
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,760
 And she said, "Yes, go," she answered.

71
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,640
 "So the girl went and got the baby's mother.

72
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,480
 "Pharaoh's daughter said to her,

73
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,080
 "Take this baby and nurse him for me."

74
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,880
 And, "I will pay you."

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,600
 So the women took the baby and nursed him.

76
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,360
 When the child grew older,

77
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,440
 she took him to Pharaoh's daughter,

78
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,520
 and he became her son.

79
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,520
 She named him Moses, saying, "I drew him out of the water."

80
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,640
 Now, the very first thing that we can learn from Miriam

81
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,160
 is how do we be faithful?

82
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,800
 Well, seeing from her story is to be courageous

83
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,920
 for the people that you love.

84
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,160
 Well, it's actually extremely courageous

85
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,600
 for Miriam to be speaking to Pharaoh's daughter,

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,920
 because remember, she was just a Hebrew slave,

87
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,000
 and here it is, the Pharaoh's daughter,

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,400
 this official, this royalty.

89
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,880
 So what it meant was that if she had said anything

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
 that the princess did not like,

91
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,520
 then her life could be in danger.

92
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,240
 But instead, she was courageous enough

93
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,400
 to go in front of the princess and actually tell her

94
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,320
 that, "Do you want me to get a nurse for this baby?"

95
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,840
 Not only was she courageous, but also cunning.

96
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,360
 Now, this kind of courage is not like one

97
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,840
 where we'll eat a type of exotic food,

98
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,840
 like a fried insect, or not even going up to your crush

99
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,200
 and asking them out for a date kind of courage, right?

100
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,000
 'Cause those ones don't cause your life.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,800
 But this kind is the one where you're going on a bungee jump

102
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,680
 and you're not quite sure the rope won't break,

103
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,240
 but if it does, you're gonna die.

104
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,800
 So this is the kind of courage that she had.

105
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,480
 And remember what her age was, most likely just above six,

106
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,480
 'cause I think anything younger,

107
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,960
 the princess probably wouldn't take her seriously,

108
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,080
 and probably somewhere less than 12 years old,

109
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,920
 otherwise she would already have been an adolescent.

110
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,120
 So imagine for that to happen.

111
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,840
 I mean, it's easy for us to think

112
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,840
 that a mother would protect a child,

113
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
 but this is actually quite the reverse.

114
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,160
 It was a child preserving the life of this baby

115
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,440
 and also for the family.

116
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,840
 And at first I thought, "Well, did she do it for herself?"

117
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,360
 Mostly, most likely not, because who wants a baby brother?

118
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,720
 The divided attention of the parent, right?

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,280
 Of course not.

120
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,240
 So she didn't do it for herself,

121
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,440
 but instead for the loved ones of her.

122
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,360
 And why is it that when we do that,

123
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,520
 we're actually faithful to God,

124
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,080
 when we're courageous for our loved ones?

125
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,400
 Because she had no idea that eventually Moses

126
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,360
 would be the leader of the Israelites.

127
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,920
 But when she was courageous for those ones that she loved,

128
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,760
 God actually used her and opened the doors.

129
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,800
 And so I wanted to ask you tonight as well.

130
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,800
 I mean, have you ever been courageous

131
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
 for someone that you love

132
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,240
 and am willing to lay down your life for him or her?

133
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,240
 Well, recently I've met with some distant relative.

134
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,560
 And how distant are they?

135
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,440
 Well, I only see them during funerals and weddings.

136
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,840
 So that's how distant.

137
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
 And so I actually was at a funeral

138
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,840
 of one of my relatives a few weeks ago.

139
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,320
 And when I went, I really had this thought,

140
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,080
 all right, this is the time

141
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,880
 when I'm gonna seize the opportunity,

142
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,160
 I'm gonna share the gospel with them.

143
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,400
 And so I was there and I was trying to find a way,

144
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,760
 but eventually I talked with my aunt and my cousin.

145
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,800
 But honestly, I have to confess,

146
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,280
 I did not have the courage to mention Jesus to them.

147
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,640
 And I felt really bad afterwards.

148
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,780
 I'm like, oh, when am I gonna get this chance?

149
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,200
 But the Lord had been good.

150
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,000
 And so He actually opened up an opportunity

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,440
 and someone from our relative said, what's your number?

152
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,360
 Let's create a WhatsApp group.

153
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,840
 I'm like, okay, this is good.

154
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,480
 So we created a WhatsApp group

155
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,760
 with like 20 of our relatives there.

156
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,120
 I'm like, all right, this is good,

157
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,240
 even though I was too chickened out.

158
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,160
 And then just last week,

159
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,320
 one of those aunts actually invited my mom to lunch.

160
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,880
 And I wanted to say it did not happen for the last 30 years

161
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,120
 'cause it's from my dad's side.

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,400
 So we haven't seen them for some time.

163
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,960
 And so my mom also told me, she's like,

164
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,560
 okay, I will go and spread the gospel.

165
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,520
 I'm like, all right, mom, you go, you go.

166
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,360
 Because I kind of messed up last time.

167
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,920
 So I said, I'll be praying for you.

168
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,500
 And then, so she went,

169
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,020
 and of course she was also very scared.

170
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,200
 And when you're scared, you sit through the entire dinner

171
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,380
 without mentioning what you wanted to say there, right?

172
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,320
 So eventually the people started getting up

173
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,640
 and they have to go, right?

174
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,600
 And that's when my mom mustered up the courage and said,

175
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,920
 you know, my daughter is speaking next week

176
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,680
 at the church on the Cantonese side

177
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,440
 'cause they only know Cantonese.

178
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,900
 And I said, well, would you guys like to listen

179
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,080
 to the sermon?

180
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,540
 And surprisingly, a few of them said, yeah, okay.

181
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,840
 But we thought to ourselves, well, just because they said,

182
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,040
 yes, we're not sure if they're gonna watch it.

183
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,800
 But after my mom sent it out,

184
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,440
 actually one of the relatives watched it.

185
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,960
 And then he encouraged everybody else to watch it,

186
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,880
 which is a lot nicer than us promoting ourselves, right?

187
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,320
 So, and what I wanted to say was, you know,

188
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,920
 we might not be like Miriam,

189
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,600
 where's life and death all the time.

190
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,440
 And thank God for that.

191
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,480
 But we're actually put in a position sometimes

192
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,000
 to be courageous for the ones we love.

193
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,880
 And that might mean just mustering up that bit of courage

194
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,600
 to speak to, actually, I don't know why,

195
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,000
 but it's hardest to speak to our relatives

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,720
 and our moms and dads.

197
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,880
 And, you know, maybe it's that,

198
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,280
 or to share it with our coworkers.

199
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,440
 Or sometimes it might mean for us

200
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,440
 to see someone being in an unjust situation

201
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,680
 and just being courageous and putting out our hands

202
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,080
 to help them,

203
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,600
 even though there might be oppositions happening.

204
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,720
 So today, you know,

205
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,840
 I really feel like God's asking us to be faithful servants.

206
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,760
 And that means for us to be courageous,

207
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,000
 to help those around us, to bring them to Christ.

208
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,200
 And a lot of time it just means doing that step.

209
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,600
 So very proud of you, mom, you know?

210
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 And yeah, so the next thing that, you know,

211
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,240
 when Miriam appears again

212
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,640
 is actually at the crossing of the sea.

213
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,640
 And that is in Exodus chapter 15, 19 to 21.

214
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,160
 So this is a time when they have just crossed the Red Sea

215
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,120
 on dry land because God has split the sea

216
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,400
 and then they have crossed,

217
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,200
 but then the Egyptians that were chasing after them

218
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,640
 also went in and the water drowned them.

219
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,720
 And this is the moment when Miriam comes up again.

220
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
 And so let me read it to you.

221
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,520
 In Exodus chapter 15, 19 to 21.

222
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,440
 When Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and horsemen

223
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,000
 went into the sea,

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,880
 the Lord brought the waters of the sea back over them.

225
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,920
 But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.

226
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,120
 Then Miriam the prophet,

227
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,960
 notice she's called the prophet here,

228
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,480
 Aaron's sister took a timbrel in her hand

229
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,480
 and all the women followed her with timbrels and dancing.

230
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,840
 Miriam sang to them and Pastor John asked me not to sing.

231
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,000
 So I will not sing this verse.

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,760
 Sing to the Lord for he is highly exalted,

233
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,200
 both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea.

234
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,080
 I still think it would have been better by saying it,

235
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,400
 but anyways.

236
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,920
 So the second point that we want to learn from Miriam

237
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,840
 about being faithful is to use our gifts.

238
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,080
 Now Miriam led all the women in songs.

239
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,840
 Now this is not just a few women, this is all.

240
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,360
 Do you know how many women were there?

241
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,200
 600,000 women.

242
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,040
 And they were praising the Lord together, singing this.

243
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,720
 And not only was she a leader, but she was also a musician.

244
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,640
 I mean, timbrels are probably a tambourine like instrument

245
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,640
 and imagine, I mean, just us having been here

246
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,200
 in front of maybe 100 people, it's hard enough,

247
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,560
 but 600,000 people.

248
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,120
 And actually for her, as a female,

249
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,160
 she actually played a very unique role as well.

250
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,840
 'Cause remember that time when the Pharaoh

251
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,520
 asked all the babies to be drowned?

252
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,200
 I mean, imagine the hurts in all of those mother's heart.

253
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,160
 And also if your neighbors, if their baby was killed

254
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,800
 and you saw that, that must have been so painful

255
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,200
 for all of the women to be watching.

256
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,200
 And so this, for Miriam to step up with her leadership skill

257
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,320
 with her worship skills and just bringing the women together

258
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,480
 and allowing them this opportunity to say,

259
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,920
 look at our God, He has vindicated us.

260
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,760
 Instead of having our babies drowned,

261
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,080
 now all of the Egyptians who came after us,

262
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,320
 they are drowning.

263
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,480
 So she really stepped up and used her gifts.

264
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,560
 And that's one of the ways that we can be faithful too.

265
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,560
 And I wanna read you from 1 Peter 4, chapter 4, 10 to 11.

266
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,000
 It says, "Each of you should use whatever gift

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,880
 "you have received to serve others."

268
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,880
 As faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms.

269
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,560
 If anyone speaks, they should do so

270
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,800
 as one who speaks the very words of God.

271
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,780
 If anyone serves, they should do so

272
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,040
 with the strength God provides.

273
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,540
 And you see here, Miriam was doing exactly that.

274
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,940
 She was a faithful steward.

275
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,040
 She just stepped up and brought the ladies together

276
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,020
 to worship because that was her place

277
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,480
 and she seized the opportunity.

278
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,800
 And I just wanna say that I'm very encouraged here

279
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,720
 at our church all the time.

280
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,040
 I mean, last week, Christina came up

281
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,800
 and she was telling us about how she is starting

282
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,920
 to work with a lot of the babies

283
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
 and even the children's ministry.

284
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,740
 And that's really her gift.

285
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,640
 And we can see that it's her passion as well.

286
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,620
 And of course today, and every week we saw our worship team.

287
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,480
 There's Paul and Yen and there's Kelly and Florence

288
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
 and all of our musicians here.

289
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,400
 They're using the gifts and talents really to help us

290
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,520
 to serve the Lord, to lead us into praise and worship.

291
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,800
 And not to mention, at our sound booth,

292
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,020
 it's very dark at the back,

293
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,240
 but we have volunteers and interns

294
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,340
 and we've got Esther and Toby

295
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,160
 and then there's Fave and Sterling

296
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,160
 and they're faithfully serving with their gifts as well.

297
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,340
 And our greeters, Kathy and Vincent helps out all the time

298
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,900
 along with the other greeters.

299
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,340
 And it's just amazing to watch.

300
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,220
 And I can't even name all of us

301
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,340
 because there are so many of you guys doing that.

302
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,420
 And we also have our clan leaders as well.

303
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,840
 And I mean, the list can go on

304
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,540
 and then we'll stay here until 8 p.m.

305
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,100
 and then that will be an issue.

306
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,260
 And so, I mean, I'm sorry if I left out your name.

307
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,180
 I didn't mean to.

308
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,040
 It's just the list does get really long.

309
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,860
 But I just wanna say that it's so encouraging to watch

310
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,620
 because that's how we become the faithful stewards of God.

311
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,100
 And so today, I just wanna, once again,

312
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,940
 when we look at the story of Miriam

313
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,940
 and how she used her gifts.

314
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,480
 And why is it important?

315
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,200
 Because you are all very unique

316
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,560
 and you might be able to serve a group

317
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,700
 that someone else cannot.

318
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,340
 So if you don't step up,

319
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,240
 someone is actually suffering from that.

320
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,540
 So anyways, if you're one of those that says,

321
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,500
 "I have no gifts to share or use."

322
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,300
 You know what one of my gifts are?

323
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,700
 To identify other people's gifts.

324
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,620
 So if you have trouble finding that,

325
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,420
 let's come to one of us

326
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,420
 and we'll be very happy to help you identify what those are.

327
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,740
 So let us read on to see Miriam's life.

328
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,820
 So let's see.

329
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,420
 So she reappears again in the Bible in Numbers,

330
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,260
 the book of Numbers chapter 12.

331
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,060
 Now this time, it isn't as bright as the first two times.

332
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,660
 I will learn from her mistakes.

333
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,780
 So this account is where the Israelites have,

334
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,860
 so they've just crossed the Red Sea

335
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,980
 and now they're approaching the Promised Land.

336
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,100
 And this is what happens.

337
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,420
 I will read it to you again.

338
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,420
 It is Numbers chapter 12, starting in verse one.

339
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,500
 Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses

340
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,380
 because of his cushion wife,

341
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,460
 for he had Mary a cushion.

342
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,780
 "Has the Lord spoken only through Moses?" they ask.

343
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,460
 "Hasn't he also spoken through us?"

344
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,680
 And the Lord heard this.

345
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,860
 Now Moses was a very humble man,

346
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,300
 more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.

347
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,420
 Now the Lord was angry about this

348
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,380
 and actually asked all three of them

349
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,600
 to come out to the tent of meeting.

350
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,900
 That's where they were.

351
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,900
 And he came down in a pillar of cloud, this is bad,

352
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,540
 and he stood at the entrance and summoned,

353
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,200
 Aaron, Miriam, come forward.

354
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,780
 Okay, this is, you know, when the Lord calls you

355
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,780
 and it's not good, then, you know, we better be awake.

356
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,620
 So this is what he said in verse six.

357
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,180
 "Listen to my words.

358
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,600
 "When there is a prophet among you,

359
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,460
 "I, the Lord, reveal myself to them in visions.

360
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,660
 "I speak to them in dreams,

361
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,780
 "but this is not true of my servant Moses.

362
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,920
 "He is faithful in all my house,

363
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,020
 "with him I speak face to face, clearly,

364
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,380
 "and not in riddles.

365
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,180
 "He sees the form of the Lord.

366
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,300
 "Why then were you not afraid

367
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,480
 "to speak against my servant Moses?

368
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,300
 "The anger of the Lord burned against them,

369
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,140
 "and he left them."

370
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,500
 Now Miriam's skin right afterwards was leprous.

371
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,740
 It was white as snow,

372
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,900
 and it was as if it was half eaten away.

373
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
 And Aaron was pardoned from this,

374
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,580
 most likely because Miriam was the one that initiated it.

375
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,780
 And Aaron begged Moses,

376
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,860
 "Forgive us of our sins and pray to the Lord."

377
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,100
 And so Moses cried out to the Lord saying,

378
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,580
 "Please, God, heal her."

379
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,540
 And he did hear her prayer and healed her,

380
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,840
 except she was to be confined outside the camp

381
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,060
 for seven days before being back.

382
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:28,540
 So, I mean, this is utter humiliation for Miriam,

383
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,940
 which is almost the exact opposite

384
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,980
 of what she was going for.

385
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,300
 Because, I mean, what was it that she was trying to do?

386
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,300
 She was trying to accuse Moses

387
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,300
 of having this Kashite woman to be a wife.

388
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,060
 And we're not quite sure what that means.

389
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,180
 I mean, Kashite could mean the wife that she has,

390
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,380
 Sephora, when she was a Median wife,

391
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,900
 Median wife that he had acquired when he was in the desert,

392
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,380
 or it could mean that he had another wife,

393
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,780
 but that her skin color was different.

394
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,980
 And so, I mean, we don't really seem to know

395
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,000
 what the issue is,

396
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,860
 but she seems to be using it against Moses to say that,

397
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,340
 "Well, he's not so great after all."

398
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,820
 And so, I mean, when we look at this,

399
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,980
 we see that God makes no comment

400
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,460
 on this cushioned wife of Moses.

401
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,220
 So, obviously, it was not bothering God,

402
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,980
 but what was bothering God?

403
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,900
 What do you think it was that was Miriam's crime?

404
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,580
 I mean, could it be like last week

405
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,340
 when Pastor James is teaching us on envy?

406
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,620
 Was it because of envy and jealousy?

407
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,260
 I mean, it seemed to be like so on the surface, doesn't it?

408
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,260
 It seemed to be that he wants to be the same as Moses.

409
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,900
 But if we look further into the scripture,

410
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,100
 what is really her crime?

411
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:03,300
 You see, her crime wasn't so much on what she said,

412
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,820
 because if it was envy and jealousy,

413
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,400
 then God will be a very busy person

414
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,300
 because he'll have to punish every person

415
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,900
 that's jealous or envious or even prideful.

416
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,900
 But no, God came down actually for Moses, not for Miriam.

417
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,660
 So what was her crime was that it wasn't so much

418
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,620
 what she did, but who she did it to.

419
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,280
 It was because she was talking against his servant.

420
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,340
 That was her crime.

421
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,900
 And so now we can also learn from Miriam's mistake.

422
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,780
 If we want to be faithful to God,

423
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,300
 actually, we need to focus on God.

424
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,840
 This is the third point.

425
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,320
 We need to focus on God.

426
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,560
 You see, while Miriam was so focused on the power

427
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,240
 and the status, you know, rather or not,

428
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,080
 she is the same as a prophet as Moses,

429
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,660
 Moses was not focused on that.

430
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,460
 What was Moses focused on?

431
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,660
 God.

432
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,020
 He was focused on just being faithful to God.

433
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,220
 And how do we know that is because in the previous chapter,

434
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,020
 in chapter 11, he was actually the one that asked God,

435
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,340
 "Could you send me some help?"

436
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,260
 Because all these Israelites, they're complaining

437
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,460
 that there's no meat in the middle of the desert.

438
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,300
 And then God said, "Okay, okay."

439
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,420
 Well, he didn't actually quote, I don't wanna say,

440
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,460
 I quote God saying, "Okay," right?

441
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,180
 So he actually said, "All right, bring 70 of the elders

442
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,960
 "and the officials, and I will take some of the power

443
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,160
 "that I've given to you, and I'm gonna place it on them

444
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,300
 "so they can help you."

445
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:52,240
 And so while he placed his hand on them and prayed for them,

446
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,060
 not only did the 70 people received God's power,

447
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,940
 but two more from outside that camp.

448
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,100
 And so they were also prophesying.

449
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,240
 And what happened was Joshua went straight to Moses saying,

450
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,260
 "They're prophesying, stop them."

451
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,900
 And you know what?

452
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,020
 This is what Moses replied.

453
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,740
 "Are you jealous?"

454
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,820
 I didn't put it on my PowerPoint, I'll have to read it.

455
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,020
 "Are you jealous for my sake?

456
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,520
 "I wish that all the Lord's people were prophets

457
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,520
 "and that the Lord would put his spirit on them."

458
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,440
 So we can see that the heart of Moses

459
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,740
 was not on hoarding more power,

460
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,940
 but that he actually wanted all people to be prophets.

461
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,940
 And so we need to ask ourselves the same thing.

462
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,940
 Are we faithful to the job that God called us to do?

463
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,420
 Or are we faithful to God himself

464
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,060
 and how he wants to do things?

465
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:02,060
 Now, what we find is that Moses was so secure

466
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,180
 in his relationship with the Lord

467
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,780
 that he didn't feel like he had to compete

468
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,540
 or he has to get God's approval

469
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,720
 or to try to prove anything to anyone.

470
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,060
 And I just wanna share with you

471
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:22,060
 how I also am so secure in my earthly father.

472
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,380
 I mean, I remember a time when I was really young,

473
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,700
 I was about, I think eight or so.

474
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,700
 And oh, well, I mean, for my entire youth time,

475
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,020
 my dad had favored me.

476
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,700
 And I have to say, this is not only my version,

477
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,380
 you won't hear a different version from my sister, okay?

478
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,980
 And my dad favored me so much

479
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,380
 that when we went out for dinners,

480
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,060
 I was the one that got the shark fin soup with the rice.

481
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,660
 That is the (speaks in foreign language)

482
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,060
 Okay, if you know that dish.

483
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,140
 And I was the only one who got it.

484
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,240
 Everybody was sitting there.

485
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,220
 So that was how much I was favored.

486
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,260
 And I just, well, I knew that my relationship with him

487
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,300
 was rock solid.

488
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,460
 And so one time, my sisters, I have two older sisters,

489
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,860
 wronged me in some way and I was crying.

490
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,540
 And I looked at myself in the mirror

491
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,860
 and I looked like I've just cried.

492
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,220
 And I know that if I walked out there,

493
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,460
 my dad would scold at them and would punish them.

494
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,740
 And I really didn't want that to happen.

495
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,900
 So what I found in the bathroom was some baby powder.

496
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,160
 And so I thought baby powder equals to makeup.

497
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,300
 Hey, I was only eight,

498
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,180
 so I have no idea what the difference is.

499
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,660
 So there I was, powdering myself up

500
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,420
 and making sure that my dad would see me

501
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,620
 as if I haven't cried.

502
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,700
 And of course, by the time I was done,

503
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,900
 my face was, I mean, white as a ghost.

504
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,260
 So, and so, you know, when I walked out,

505
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,140
 I mean, I thought it was perfectly looking,

506
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,580
 but of course my dad asked, have you been crying?

507
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,300
 And I'm like, yes.

508
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,860
 Was your sisters mean to you?

509
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,420
 I was like, yes.

510
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:06,580
 And then he asked, is it that you're putting on all this

511
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,500
 so I wouldn't punish them?

512
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,860
 And I said, yes.

513
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,580
 And then he said, well,

514
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,060
 because you don't want me to punish them,

515
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,100
 I will pardon them.

516
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,860
 And, you know, I was so secure with my place

517
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,760
 in my father's heart that I didn't feel

518
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,700
 like I have to compete.

519
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,140
 And not only did I feel like I didn't have to compete,

520
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,220
 but I want, I didn't, I was,

521
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,460
 I was having enough love for even my sisters.

522
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,340
 And I feel like, you know, with this,

523
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,060
 when we see Miriam, what happened was

524
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,260
 she was still trying to gain the approval of men

525
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,020
 or trying to have a status in God's heart.

526
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,380
 And that was not the right approach.

527
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,380
 What was the right approach was what Moses had.

528
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,740
 And he had an extraordinary relationship with God.

529
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,500
 It was so secure that he didn't have to fight over it

530
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,260
 or, you know, to feel like he's,

531
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,320
 his status might be in jeopardy.

532
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,420
 And that's why he could extend and say,

533
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,220
 I wish that everyone was prophets

534
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,940
 and was able to have the spirit on them.

535
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,060
 You know, that's something for us to think about.

536
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,860
 I mean, are we also in the place where we're so secure

537
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,740
 that we don't have to compete for it?

538
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,000
 Or is it that sometimes that someone did something

539
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,260
 really well or even better than us,

540
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,220
 that we start to feel like we need to prove

541
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,340
 that we're doing as good as them or even better

542
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,820
 or put them down.

543
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,380
 And I mean, it's easy, you know,

544
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,760
 if that person is a lot older than you or a lot younger,

545
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,880
 but if you guys happen to come from the same background,

546
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,140
 let's say the same school around the same age,

547
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,940
 it just becomes so much harder.

548
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,880
 But if we learn from this,

549
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,180
 which is if we have the right relationship with God,

550
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,860
 then we don't have to be like Miriam and be envious

551
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,380
 because we're so secure in God.

552
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,960
 And so there are two things at least we can learn

553
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,700
 about God here is that when he has

554
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,020
 an extraordinary relationship with someone,

555
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:29,020
 he's actually ready to defend that person in a heartbeat.

556
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,120
 And also he's willing to reveal himself.

557
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,440
 See here that he says, "For a prophet,

558
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,300
 "he speaks in like visions and riddles,

559
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,360
 "but not for Moses

560
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,040
 "because of this extraordinary relationship."

561
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,040
 And also we see that he has extraordinary relationships

562
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,960
 with people who are humble and faithful to him.

563
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,960
 And so that is the key, everyone.

564
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,320
 That is the key.

565
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,720
 How do we have this relationship?

566
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,720
 Is that we are humbled and we are also faithful to him.

567
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,260
 Now, I mean, it's easy to say humble or faithful,

568
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,520
 but what does that mean?

569
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,480
 Well, if we look at John, not John,

570
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,200
 but if we look at the book of gospel of John,

571
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,880
 chapter 14, 21, it says,

572
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,480
 "Whoever has my commands and keeps them

573
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,720
 "is the one who loves me.

574
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,600
 "And the one who loves me will be loved by my father,

575
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,040
 "and I too will love them."

576
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,200
 And see this, "And show myself to them."

577
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,240
 I mean, church, do you want God to show himself to you?

578
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,400
 Do you want him to love you?

579
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,400
 I mean, I don't wanna say this as if this is works.

580
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,120
 We're not working to get a place in God's heart,

581
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,520
 but it says here that if we follow his commands,

582
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,400
 it means that we love him.

583
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,840
 So this is an act of love that we're doing.

584
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,220
 It is not the result.

585
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,040
 And so, I mean, just recently, I was reading my Bible

586
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,680
 and one of the scripture that I was reading

587
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,040
 was Hagar and Ishmael.

588
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,080
 I mean, what I wanted to say is,

589
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,200
 every day when we read a Bible verse,

590
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,240
 it might not seem like it's very related

591
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,520
 to what we might be going through.

592
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,160
 But if we take that verse, I mean, for me,

593
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,080
 it was Ishmael and Hagar,

594
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,760
 they were kicked out of Abraham's home.

595
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,020
 And then they saw that there was no way out

596
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,080
 and they cried out to the Lord.

597
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,340
 And then the Lord said, "I will bless Ishmael."

598
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,520
 And then her eyes was open and she saw an oasis

599
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,820
 where there was water and that's how they lived on.

600
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,820
 And of course, he also became a prosperous nation.

601
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,760
 So I mean, how would that help us

602
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,680
 if that happened to be the Bible verse that you read?

603
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,480
 And how it helped me was that I focus on God's goodness.

604
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,240
 And so while I was preparing literally for this sermon,

605
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,680
 I prayed into those scriptures.

606
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,680
 And I just said, "God, you're the God that provides.

607
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,960
 And right now I really need your divine enlightenment."

608
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
 And he helped me.

609
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,920
 He just gave me these enlightenments

610
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,280
 and I wrote this sermon with the fastest speed.

611
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,600
 And I think Pastor John could be my testimony of that.

612
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,360
 I can testify on it.

613
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,680
 And so, I mean, what I wanted to say is that

614
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,020
 we need to not focus on the road that we're in,

615
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,040
 but we need to focus on building

616
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,380
 this extraordinary relationship

617
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,280
 so that God appears in our lives every single day.

618
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,920
 Now, so today concluding,

619
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,240
 I just wanted to say that in Miriam's life,

620
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,600
 she has both strengths and weaknesses

621
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,220
 and we can learn from it to see how we can be faithful

622
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,760
 in our walk with God.

623
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,560
 I mean, she was courageous for her loved ones

624
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,640
 and we need to do that too.

625
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,520
 She was using her gifts at the right time in a unique way

626
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,800
 that served the purpose of God.

627
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,080
 And lastly, even though it was her mistake

628
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,120
 that she had focused on other things,

629
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,600
 but we know we can learn that we need to focus on God

630
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,160
 and building that intimate relationship with Him.

631
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,640
 And that is the key.

632
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,260
 'Cause while we serve God,

633
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,400
 it's easy to actually lose God Himself.

634
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,400
 So today, let us all be faithful servants of God.

635
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:46,440
 And the Lord our God shall speak to us then

636
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,080
 face to face and we won't have to guess what He is saying.

637
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,280
 And He can show up in your life every single day.

638
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,000
 So let us surrender everything that we have to Him

639
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,820
 and let us just want Him and Him alone.

640
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,260
 So let us pray together.

641
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,640
 Dear Heavenly Father,

642
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,640
 we thank you so much that you are in our midst

643
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,600
 and Father, you said that if we keep your commands,

644
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,400
 we are the ones who love you and you will love us back

645
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,680
 and you will show yourself to us.

646
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,240
 And Father, we pray that today,

647
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,260
 as we learn from the life of Miriam, your servant,

648
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,880
 that we too can know and remember

649
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,760
 that the most important thing of course

650
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,400
 is to use the gifts that you've given us,

651
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,400
 but it's even more important that we focus on you.

652
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,800
 And Father, we pray that we'll surrender ourselves

653
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,080
 for one purpose only,

654
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,220
 and that is to build this extraordinary relationship

655
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,140
 with you.

656
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,800
 So help us God.

657
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,560
 In Jesus Christ name we pray, amen.
