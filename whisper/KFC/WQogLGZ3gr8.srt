1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,320
 Thank you Michelle for that kind introduction. Tonight I'm not going to preach so much as

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:22,440
 prophesy. Now I know what you're thinking, has Pastor John gone weird? But I just want

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:31,760
 to debunk and describe what prophecy actually is. That prophecy is not so much predicting

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:43,400
 the future as speaking God's word for the moment. Prophecy is forth telling as much

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:54,200
 as foretelling. And it may simply be defined as speaking forth, speaking out God's word

6
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:04,440
 to those whom God has desired to hear it. God, through scripture and through his people,

7
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:17,280
 continues to speak today. And he wants to use us to strengthen, encourage and comfort

8
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:31,960
 each other. I believe that God in the year 2020 is still saying, "Dear Church." And

9
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:38,440
 that is the title of our 8 week series in the book of Revelation and will encompass

10
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:52,760
 the first three chapters of Revelation. Revelation is a book of prophecy. We will be studying

11
00:01:52,760 --> 00:02:07,440
 seven letters to the seven churches. They are prophetic letters. Now look at this, "On

12
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:18,400
 the Lord's day I was in the spirit and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet which

13
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:33,640
 said write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, to Smyrna,

14
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:47,400
 to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia and Laodicea." And here we see a map of those

15
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:58,520
 seven churches. The obscure and extravagant imagery of the book of Revelation has led

16
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:14,320
 to a wide variety of Christian interpretations. Historicists, Preterists, Idealists and Futurists.

17
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:25,000
 Now don't get hung up on four big words. The table in front of you explains them a little

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,480
 bit. Historicist interpretations see Revelation as containing a broad view of history. To

19
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:43,200
 put it another way, the historicist aligns historical events with what is described in

20
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:53,760
 Revelation. Whilst Preterists interpretations treat Revelation as mostly referring to the

21
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,380
 events of the first century, to the apostolic age or at least to the fall of the Roman Empire.

22
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:08,960
 In other words, they believe that the prophecies in Revelation have already been fulfilled.

23
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:17,840
 Thirdly, the idealist or should we say symbolic interpretations consider that Revelation does

24
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,200
 not refer to actual people or events but it is an illustration of the spiritual path and

25
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:34,240
 the ongoing struggle between good and evil. Futurists meanwhile believe that Revelation

26
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:42,320
 describes future events with the seven churches growing into the body of believers throughout

27
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:54,240
 the age. You might be asking yourself which approach is correct? Well, each one is true

28
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:03,240
 in some regard. The book of Revelation did speak to John's day. It speaks to church history.

29
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:10,960
 It does have meaning for our personal life. And while elements of the first three approaches

30
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:21,040
 have their place, we cannot deny the place of the futurist view. We can know that the

31
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:31,240
 book of Revelation speaks with clarity about what we call end times because of two central

32
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:43,640
 principles drawn from Revelation 1, 1-3. Firstly, we believe that the book of Revelation must

33
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:50,880
 mean something. This is a book that Jesus gave to show his servant something. It is

34
00:05:50,880 --> 00:06:00,240
 not a book of meaningless nonsense. It has a promise of blessing, not a promise of confusion.

35
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:11,440
 And secondly, we believe that Revelation definitely claims to contain predictive prophecy. John

36
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,520
 made it clear. He spoke about things which must shortly take place. He said the time

37
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:29,240
 is near. John wrote about events that were still future to him. But what about the church

38
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:41,440
 today? I believe this is possibly one of the most significant times in church history.

39
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:52,880
 Are we a church in crisis with all that's going on? Or are we a church in opportunity?

40
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:01,760
 I believe we have a choice. We can either get on with what we know as church, doing

41
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:08,640
 things that we've always done in the way that we've always done them. People say to me,

42
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:16,920
 "Pastor John, I can't wait to get back to church the way it was." Or do we use this

43
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:30,960
 season to listen to what God is saying as he speaks the word, "Dear Church." And to

44
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:39,240
 help me, I want to look closely at the first few words of Revelation chapter 1. Let me

45
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:49,240
 read them. "The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave him to show his servants things

46
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:59,840
 which must shortly take place." Let's pick this apart. Firstly, the revelation of Jesus

47
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:10,960
 Christ. Now the ancient Greek word which is translated "revelation" is "apokalipsis"

48
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:24,920
 means the apocalypse. This word simply means a revealing or an unveiling. The book of Revelation

49
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:32,040
 is the revelation of Jesus Christ in the sense that it belongs to him. He is the one doing

50
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:41,000
 the revealing. It is also Jesus' revelation in the sense that he is the object revealed.

51
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:53,480
 Jesus is the person revealed by the book. From the outset, we are given the most important

52
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,560
 truth about the book of Revelation. Yes, this book shows us the Antichrist. Yes, it shows

53
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,920
 us God's judgment. Yes, it shows us calamity on the earth. And yes, it shows us the mystery

54
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:20,120
 Babylon in vivid detail. But most of all, it is the revelation of Jesus Christ to us.

55
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:32,640
 If we catch everything else but miss Jesus in the book, we miss the book of Revelation.

56
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:43,760
 And I want to say to us KFCI, how we need a revelation of Jesus. What is Jesus to you?

57
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,240
 A person in a book? A good man? A worker of miracles? An upmarket Santa Claus that you

58
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:59,880
 can pray to with your shopping list? I'm praying for you right now that he would reveal himself

59
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:14,040
 to you as a saviour, lord, healer, deliverer. But what was the reason for the book of Revelation?

60
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:22,440
 The answer is in this phrase, "which God gave him to show his servants." This is an important

61
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:30,520
 reason why God the Father gave the revelation of Jesus Christ. He gave it to show his servants.

62
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:38,240
 God gave this revelation that it might be shown, not hidden. This is an apocalypse,

63
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:47,480
 a revelation, not an apocrypha, something hidden. But what was God the Father through

64
00:10:47,480 --> 00:11:01,720
 Jesus showing? He was showing things which must shortly take place. This describes when

65
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,160
 the events will take place. They will happen shortly and they must happen shortly. This

66
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:15,000
 means the book of Revelation is a book of predictive prophecy. It speaks of things that

67
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,560
 will happen in the future, at least in the future, at the time of writing. According

68
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:30,000
 to Revelation 1, verse 3, the time is near for the fulfilment of these things but the

69
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:41,280
 time was not present at the time of writing. Now let me explain. Short and near are relative

70
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:52,520
 terms and my friends this is God's timetable, not man's. Yet for 2,000 years history has

71
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,840
 been on the brink of consummation of all things, running parallel to the edge, not running

72
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:10,000
 towards a distant brink. The Greek phrase for shortly literally means quickly or suddenly

73
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,800
 coming to pass. The idea is not that the event may occur soon but that when it does it will

74
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:33,040
 be sudden. I just want us to be ready. Now God had a harsh word for nearly all of the

75
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:40,320
 seven churches. I don't want to do a spoiler alert tonight but recommend the next seven

76
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:52,560
 weeks. But God also had a promise to the conqueror in both the NIV and the ESV. He talks about

77
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:03,680
 to the one who conquers. It's like if we've got a habit in everyday life. When we conquer

78
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:17,640
 it our life is different before than after. But tonight I want to cover what I believe

79
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:31,120
 that God may be saying to the church now. And I would submit that God may be saying

80
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:44,320
 this. To the church in 2020 there is no new normal. I hold this against you. You keep

81
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:56,800
 saying I want to get back to church. But the church you want to get back to does not exist.

82
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:08,960
 Listen to my voice. I've drawn a little picture with Bonnie's help of highway 2020, freeway

83
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:18,280
 2020, motorway 2020. Call it what you like. But let's look at it just for a moment as

84
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:29,600
 I speak. Let me explain. We were able to by God's grace start KFCI in October 1996. No

85
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:43,920
 it was October 2016. I had a senior moment then. And our history up until 2019 was fairly

86
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:54,800
 smooth sailing. We were building momentum. We were going into something. And then in

87
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:06,960
 a few years accidents, obstacles, things got in our way. We saw firstly the political protests.

88
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:12,120
 I remember one Saturday evening preaching here when there were virtually cocktails,

89
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:19,480
 Molotov cocktails going on outside our building. Then we had and have COVID-19. And then we

90
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:28,000
 had the political differences in our city. I believe we're at a point in our church and

91
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,200
 the church worldwide where we have a choice. We can go back to the way things were and

92
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:44,560
 there is definitely a path that leads back there. Or we can look forward. Now I need

93
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:55,320
 to warn you the way forward is dangerous. It's bumpy. There are warning signals out

94
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:08,120
 there. But I just want to say this. The temptation is to go back. Retrace our roots. Go back

95
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:20,720
 to the familiar path. It is the easy option. God I believe is warning us against this.

96
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:35,520
 I believe it is simply not an option if we are to fulfil God's vision for our church.

97
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:43,600
 Because almost 100% of Hong Kong is linked by technology as we are using technology this

98
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:53,320
 evening. I want to use some technological type words to demonstrate what I believe God

99
00:16:53,320 --> 00:17:06,840
 is encouraging us to do when he says the words "Dear Church". Firstly and importantly I believe

100
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:19,940
 God is saying "Church do not push the repeat button". Let me say that again. Do not press

101
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:28,440
 the repeat button. Isaiah 43 says "Forget the former things. Do not dwell on the past.

102
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:38,760
 See behold I am doing a new thing". We often talk about the good old days. Until we realise

103
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:47,280
 that the good old days probably weren't so good after all. But what does doing a new

104
00:17:47,280 --> 00:18:03,200
 thing entail? What is God's mandate to us today? I want to continue the theme of ours

105
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:13,760
 as I share what I believe God is saying to KFCI. To the church that we see in 2020. And

106
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:29,160
 the first is this. Reset. Can I repeat that? Reset. It means to set again or to set differently.

107
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:38,480
 Alternative words I could have used were to change, to reappraise, to adjust. I believe

108
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:48,840
 we can consider that God's finger is on the reset button. I could quite easily use the

109
00:18:48,840 --> 00:19:00,160
 word reboot. But 2020 has made this more of a necessity than an option. I think we've

110
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:11,520
 had more services online this year than live. We've experimented with pre-recorded sermons,

111
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:19,440
 pre-recorded services, live stream, zoom worship like this evening. And I want to thank all

112
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:30,880
 those in our congregation who have made these possible. We've missed face to face. But church

113
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:39,320
 attendance here and around the world, albeit measured by clicks and likes, has actually

114
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:47,240
 increased. We have attracted attendees from all across the world. With some weeks up to

115
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:57,080
 500 views on YouTube for our Saturday evening service. To be honest with you, people have

116
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:06,120
 gotten used to doing church in their shorts and not have to travel on the MTR, on the

117
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:14,920
 bus or park the car. Let's face it, in Hong Kong that's expensive to attend a church service.

118
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:24,080
 We do need to change, reappraise and adjust. We need to start anew with fresh ideas in

119
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:35,760
 the way that is consistent with who we are as KFC. But not necessarily constrained by

120
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:48,640
 what has taken place before. And the fact is this, online is something we will be seeing

121
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:58,760
 more and more globally in the future. And we have to decide, not how we can fight it,

122
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:06,920
 but how we can use it to our advantage. I want to recommend a book to you. It's a book

123
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:16,640
 called "From Social Media to Social Ministry". It was written by Nona Jones. You'll want

124
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:30,120
 to read it cover to cover. But in any event, KFCI, we need to reset. And after we have

125
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:44,760
 reset, we need to renew. Now renew can mean resume an activity after an interruption or

126
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:57,080
 to give fresh life and fresh strength to. Church, this is the key. It's the same word.

127
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:06,160
 But do we resume an activity after an interruption? Or do we give fresh life and strength to it?

128
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:17,280
 I believe that God is calling us to the latter. The alternative meanings are to refresh, to

129
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:28,680
 rejuvenate, to renovate and to restore. These are words of renewal. Look at this. It's taken

130
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:40,080
 from Isaiah 40. But those who hope or alternatively those who wait on the Lord will renew their

131
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:47,400
 strength. They will soar on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will

132
00:22:47,400 --> 00:23:05,800
 walk and not grow faint. Church, the core is clear. Reset. Renew. Now to be honest,

133
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:15,360
 I was tempted to say next, restore. Certainly it's a computer term, restore to factory setting.

134
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,120
 It's a biblical term. It's mentioned over a hundred times in the Bible. But I have a

135
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:31,320
 stronger word with a similar meaning and it's been on my heart for quite a while. Restore

136
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:44,640
 can mean that you go back to what you've had before. So I've chosen the word revive. Revive

137
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:55,040
 means to restore to life or restore to consciousness. I've had a stirring in my bones for quite

138
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:02,520
 a while with the political situation, with COVID-19, with all that is going on around

139
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:14,080
 the world. That God is about to bring a revival. But what do I mean by this? The Psalmist asked

140
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:22,480
 this in Psalm 85, "Will you not revive us again that your people may rejoice in you?"

141
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:30,960
 The Psalmist is asking God for revival so that once again the people can rejoice in

142
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:41,480
 God. Now where does revival begin? And can I just say tonight, if you are not a Christian,

143
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:49,120
 you can't be revived because firstly you've got to be vibed. You've got to be made alive

144
00:24:49,120 --> 00:25:00,080
 to Christ. Can I commend that to you tonight? But if you're a believer, I invite you to

145
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:10,920
 draw a circle around where you are standing. And I want to tell you this, revival starts

146
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:24,240
 within that circle. The word, the Hebrew word for revive is "chayah" and means to be quickened,

147
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:34,680
 to be made alive, to be restored. Showing what I just said. You must first be quickened

148
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:47,240
 or made alive by the Spirit of God before revival can occur. And this takes a new birth,

149
00:25:47,240 --> 00:26:00,440
 a new birth in Him. But the word that keeps coming to me is "awakening." I am 67 years

150
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:15,040
 of age and I'm fed up with hearing stories about past awakenings. I want to see one now.

151
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:32,400
 My friends, it will not come if we repeat. But let us reset, reboot, renew. We can do

152
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:50,680
 this but God is the only one who can revive. But I've not finished yet. There is another

153
00:26:50,680 --> 00:27:03,640
 hour left. And it's this word "reconciliation." I'll say it again. Reconciliation. The past

154
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:15,640
 year or so has resulted in a society that is divided and isolated. There has never been

155
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:27,240
 more polarization than that which we see now. Young and old, rich and poor, Republican or

156
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:39,680
 Democrat, blue or yellow, I could go on. Two things I believe God's saying to us. Be reconciled

157
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:52,240
 to Jesus, oh yes, but be reconciled to each other. And I want to honor here Florence Lau

158
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,760
 and others who have encouraged me in this area of reconciliation. I want to read you

159
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:09,280
 a passage from Paul's letter to the Corinthians, from 2 Corinthians 5. So from now on we regard

160
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:15,360
 no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do

161
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:23,880
 so no longer. Therefore if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come. The old is gone.

162
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:33,360
 The new is here. All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ and

163
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:43,520
 gave to us the ministry of reconciliation. That God was reconciling the world to himself

164
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:56,720
 in Christ, not counting people's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message

165
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:05,280
 of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ's ambassadors. As though God was making his

166
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:22,160
 appeal through us, we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God. Now I have a

167
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:33,520
 fairly hard word now. Don't even begin to think about fulfilling God's vision in renewing

168
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:43,520
 our church before we fulfill the prayer of Jesus in John 17. He said this, "My prayer

169
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,000
 is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,

170
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:01,520
 that all of them may be one Father just as you are in me and I am in you." My concluding

171
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:14,480
 comments are these. There is no new normal. I hold this against you. You keep saying,

172
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:22,640
 "I want to go back to church." But the church you want to get back to doesn't exist.

173
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:38,240
 Listen to my voice. To him who resets, reboots, renews, refreshes, I will make him or her

174
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:56,080
 an agent of reconciliation. My friend, will you hear God's voice today? A friend wrote

175
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:05,920
 to me last year. He said this, "The trip of a lifetime ended, landed in my lap. I visited

176
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:15,200
 the seven churches of Revelation. A friend and I flew to Izmir, Turkey, where we rented

177
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:29,760
 a car and we drove to all seven churches in a quick three-day trip. In the end, we saw

178
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:42,080
 a lot of rocks." Now don't get me wrong, they were beautiful rocks. But they were rocks,

179
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:51,200
 ancient ruins of cities that were once teeming with people long ago, rather like Hong Kong

180
00:31:51,200 --> 00:32:05,120
 is now. In the Apostle John's vision of Revelation, Jesus spoke to Christians in these cities,

181
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:20,240
 commending some but warning most. My question is this, do we want to be a church, a city

182
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:37,600
 with a lasting legacy or do we want to be a pile of rocks? That's my question. Hear

183
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:51,600
 what God is saying to his church. Let me pray. Father God, we thank you for the book of Revelation.

184
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,160
 We thank you Lord that you chose to speak to those seven churches and the churches throughout

185
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:05,560
 the ages through the words that you spoke to the Apostle John. And we thank you Lord

186
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:15,480
 that you are still speaking to your church today. I pray Lord that we will have the grace

187
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:22,440
 to hear your voice and Lord that you would cause us to respond. For those of us who are

188
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:31,080
 not yet believers, Lord that tonight we would make a decision to repent, to turn to you

189
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:37,600
 and to give our life to you. And for those of us who are believers, that we wouldn't

190
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:45,360
 be looking to go back to those things that we knew, those familiar things. And Lord that

191
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:53,560
 you would set our path down the road and we know it's going to be difficult to reset,

192
00:33:53,560 --> 00:34:03,720
 to renew and to revive. That Lord that you would bring your church in 2020 here in Hong

193
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:15,120
 Kong and around the world to a revival. God we proclaim that you are sovereign over us.

194
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:24,440
 May your sovereign power flow through your church right now in Jesus name. Amen.

195
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:34,440
