[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.760]   And we're taking this opportunity post Eta
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.460]   to do a short series on 2 Peter.
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:19.240]   2 Peter is actually very rarely preached in church.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.560]   And as Michelle said, I don't think I can ever remember
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.840]   preaching anything from 2 Peter in the last 25 years.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.200]   But it is an important book
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.760]   and it is an important book with an important message.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.960]   And the clue came before Lent in 1 Peter 5.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.180]   I wanna turn to it before we start.
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.300]   'Cause 1 Peter 5 said this, verse 8.
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.520]   Be alert.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.080]   Be alert and of sober mind.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.080]   "Your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion,
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.320]   "looking for someone to devour.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.140]   "Resist him, standing firm in the faith
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.200]   "because you know that the family of believers
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.480]   "throughout the world is undergoing
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.280]   "the same kind of sufferings."
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.920]   It is why we have called this short series,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.680]   "Beware, but Grow."
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.520]   Beware means to look out, keep your eyes open, stay alert.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.680]   I wanna tell you a story about a college professor
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.280]   who had a mysterious habit of removing a tennis ball
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.680]   from his jacket pocket as he walked into the lecture.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.400]   He would set it on the corner of his podium.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.600]   And after giving the lecture at the end of the day,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.440]   he would once again pick up the tennis ball,
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.120]   place it in his jacket pocket and leave the room.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.520]   No one ever understood why he did this
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.520]   until one day a student fell asleep during the lecture.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.960]   The professor didn't miss a word of his lecture
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.400]   as he walked up to the podium, picked up the tennis ball
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.160]   and he threw it.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.160]   He hit the sleeping student squarely on top of the head.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.280]   I'm much too kind to do that, I did it on his chest.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.520]   The next day, the professor walked into the room,
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.800]   reached in his jacket and removed a baseball.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.160]   No one ever fell asleep in class the rest of the semester.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.720]   As your pastors here at KFCI,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.600]   our heart for you is 100% in line with Peter's message.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.800]   That's why I'm so excited to preach this message tonight.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.260]   We want to protect you from harm.
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.240]   God has been speaking to us about being shepherds.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.560]   And the main job of a shepherd is to protect their flock.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.200]   At the same time, God has been speaking to us
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.360]   about being gardeners.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.640]   Gardeners tend their plants and help them to grow.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.640]   It is our desire to help you and to help this church grow,
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.500]   not necessarily numerically.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.120]   And tonight I'm gonna use 2 Peter 1,
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.640]   especially the first 11 verses
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.520]   to explain how we can grow in the knowledge of Christ.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.520]   Now I'm not talking about knowledge
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.680]   that enables you to pass an exam
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.480]   or get a theological degree,
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.000]   although there's nothing wrong with any of this.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.360]   But our heart is, and hear my heart on this,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.160]   not so much that you would know about Christ,
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.800]   but that you would know Christ
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.280]   and that you would grow in the knowledge of Him.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.840]   And to illustrate that, I firstly wanna talk about
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.520]   the gift of knowledge, the gift, G-I-F-T.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.400]   Now, if anybody in the early church
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.080]   knew the importance about being alert other than George,
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.840]   it was the Apostle Peter.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.080]   He had a tendency in his early years to feel overconfident
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.160]   when danger was near and to overlook his master's warnings.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.120]   Look at the Gospels.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.200]   He rushed ahead when he should have waited.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.960]   He slept when he should have prayed.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.360]   He talked when he should have listened.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.820]   He was a courageous but careless Christian.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.960]   To be honest, I identify with Peter quite a lot.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.400]   But he learned his lesson
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.000]   and he wanted to help us learn it too.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And the lesson was in those four letters, G-R-O-W, grow.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.600]   In his first epistle, you will remember,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.020]   Peter emphasised the grace of God.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.200]   We talked, didn't we, week after week
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.360]   about the grace of God.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.280]   But in his second letter,
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.300]   his emphasis is on the knowledge of God.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.640]   The word know or knowledge is used at least 13 times
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.960]   in this short epistle.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.520]   As I said, this word does not mean
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.200]   a mere intellectual understanding of some truth,
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.620]   though that is included.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.680]   It means a living participation in the truth.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.160]   The best way to detect falsehood
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.160]   is to understand the characteristics of the truth.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.400]   And what I wanna cover tonight
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.560]   is the three most important affirmations
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.560]   that Peter made about the true Christian life.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.080]   And each one is a consequence of the previous one.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.120]   You'll see this from the diagram.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   Peter says this.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.800]   Firstly, he says the Christian life begins with faith.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.600]   But the faith results in spiritual growth.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:17.020]   And that thirdly, spiritual growth brings practical results.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.480]   Have you got that?
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.560]   Let's take them one at a time.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.100]   Firstly, the Christian life begins with faith.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.720]   Peter called it like precious faith.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.800]   It means our standing with the Lord today
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.360]   is the same as the apostle centuries ago.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.440]   The ESV calls it a faith of equal standing.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.880]   To those who through the righteousness of our God
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.120]   and Saviour Jesus Christ have received a faith
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.780]   as precious as ours is what Peter said.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.720]   They had no special advantages over us
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.160]   because they were privileged to walk with Christ,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.520]   see Him with their own eyes and share in His miracles.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.280]   It is not necessary to see the Lord with our human eyes
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.520]   in order to love Him, trust Him and share His glory.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:22.160]   But the first thing that we see very clearly is this.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.480]   That this faith is in a person.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.880]   Let me read it to you.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.880]   Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.640]   To those who through the righteousness of our God
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.000]   and Saviour Jesus Christ have received a faith
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   as precious as ours, grace and peace be yours in abundance
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.760]   through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.680]   Faith is in a person and that person is Jesus Christ,
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.000]   the Son of God, the Saviour.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.400]   From the very outset of his letter,
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.880]   Peter affirmed the deity of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.640]   God and our Saviour are not two different persons.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.040]   They described one person, Jesus Christ.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.560]   This is one of the New Testament's clearest declarations
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.880]   of the divinity of Christ.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:35.160]   A Saviour is one who brings salvation.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.600]   And the word salvation was familiar
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.960]   to the people of that day.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.960]   In their vocabulary, it meant deliverance from trouble,
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.240]   particularly deliverance from the enemy.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.680]   It also carried the idea of health and safety.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   A physician was looked on as a Saviour
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.160]   because he helped deliver the body
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.080]   from pain and limitations.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.960]   A victorious general was a Saviour
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.080]   because he delivered the people from defeat.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.240]   Even a wise official was a Saviour
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.680]   because he kept the nation in order
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.920]   and delivered it from confusion and decay.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.880]   And for us, it is easy to see how the title Saviour
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.640]   applies to our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.640]   He is indeed the great physician
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.040]   who heals our heart from the sickness of sin.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.480]   He is the victorious conqueror
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.120]   who has defeated our enemies,
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.760]   sin, death, Satan, hell, and leading us in triumph.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.760]   He is God and our Saviour.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.920]   And in order to be our Saviour,
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.720]   he had to give his life upon the cross
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.160]   and die for our sins.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.320]   And Pastor Michelle shared this with us
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.080]   very clearly last week.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:19.080]   Now, these verses tell us that our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.400]   has three spiritual commodities
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.800]   that can be secured from nobody else.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:34.280]   Righteousness, grace, and peace.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:43.000]   We cannot get these from anybody else.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   When you trust him as your Saviour,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.440]   his righteousness becomes your righteousness.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.600]   And you are given a right standing before God.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.120]   You could never earn this righteousness.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.760]   It is a gift of God to those who believe.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:07.920]   Grace is God's favour to the undeserving.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:14.000]   God in his mercy does not give us what we do deserve.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.360]   God in his grace gives us what we don't deserve.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   And the result of this experience is peace.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.600]   Peace with God and the peace of God.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.160]   In fact, God's grace and peace are multiplied,
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.360]   the ESV tells us, towards us as we walk with him
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.400]   and trust his promises.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:45.280]   So yes, this faith is in a person.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.880]   But secondly, this faith involves God's power.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.800]   Verse three,
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:13:13.800]   The Christian life begins with saving faith.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.560]   Faith in the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.680]   But when you get to know Jesus Christ personally,
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.240]   you also experience God's power through the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.240]   And this power produces life and godliness.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.520]   You see, the unsaved sinner is dead.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.600]   And only Christ can raise him from the dead.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.000]   When you are born into the family of God
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.400]   through faith in Christ, you become complete.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.880]   God gives you everything that you will ever need
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.640]   for life and godliness.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.880]   Nothing has to be added.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.480]   God never has to recall any of his models
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.960]   because something is lacking or faulty.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.600]   It's great to have some babies in church.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.480]   I love this.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.440]   And just as a baby has genetic structure
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.040]   that determines how they will grow.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.720]   Thanks for the visual aids guys, by the way, it's fantastic.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.840]   So the believer is genetically structured
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.080]   to experience glory and goodness.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.640]   Other versions say glory and excellence.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:37.560]   One day, we will all be like Jesus Christ.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.120]   We have been called to his eternal glory.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.200]   And we will share that glory when Jesus Christ returns
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.840]   and takes his people to heaven.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:53.880]   But we should not wait until we get to heaven
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.640]   to be like Jesus Christ.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.880]   In our character and conduct,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.120]   he should reveal his beauty and grace today.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.560]   And so this faith is in a person.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.520]   This faith involves God's power.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:20.080]   But this faith also involves God's promises.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:26.360]   Verse four, through these he has given us his very great,
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.240]   very great and precious promises.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.560]   So that through them you might participate
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.840]   in the divine nature.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.120]   Having escaped the corruption in the world
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.160]   caused by evil desires.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.400]   God's promises are great.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.280]   They're great because they come from a great God.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.680]   And they will lead to a great life.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:56.560]   They are precious because their value is beyond calculation.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.320]   If we lost the word of God,
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.280]   there will be no way to replace it.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.440]   I thought about it, Peter's a little bit like Gollum
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.640]   in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.320]   He must have liked the word, my precious.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.480]   'Cause if we look at his epistles,
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.520]   he wrote about precious faith, precious promises,
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.240]   precious blood, precious stone, precious saviour.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.360]   My precious.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:33.160]   When the sinner believes on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.520]   the Spirit of God uses the word of God
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.040]   to impart the life and nature of God within.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:47.760]   A baby shares the nature of his parents
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.800]   and the person born of God
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.560]   shares the divine nature of God.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.760]   The lost sinner is dead,
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.480]   but the Christian is alive
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.960]   because he shares the divine nature.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.120]   The lost sinner is decaying because of his corrupt nature,
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.600]   but the Christian can experience a dynamic life of godliness
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.120]   because he has a divine nature within.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:21.760]   Mankind is under a bondage of corruption,
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.640]   but the believer shares the freedom of growth
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.480]   that is part of possessing the divine nature.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.920]   And because we possess this divine nature,
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.400]   we have completely escaped the defilement
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.120]   and decay in this present world.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.400]   If we feed the new nature,
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.240]   the nourishment of the word of God,
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.840]   we will have little interest in the garbage,
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.640]   the laptop of the world.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.680]   But if we make provision for the flesh,
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.640]   our sinful nature will lust after the old sins
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.240]   and we will disobey God.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.080]   Godly living is a result of cultivating
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.240]   the new nature within.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:22.480]   So yes, the Christian life begins with faith,
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.480]   but it doesn't end there.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.360]   We will go one step further.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.720]   Faith results in spiritual growth.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:38.640]   I spoke about the gift of knowledge.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.600]   Now I want to cover the growth of knowledge.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.760]   Let me read it to you.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:50.480]   For this reason, make every effort to add to your faith,
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.560]   goodness, and to goodness, knowledge,
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.400]   and to knowledge, self-control,
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.680]   and to self-control, perseverance,
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.560]   and to perseverance, godliness,
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.880]   and to godliness, mutual affection,
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.240]   and to mutual affection, love.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.880]   My friends, where there is life, there must be growth.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:18.520]   New birth, exciting as it is, is not the end.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.120]   It's the beginning.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.320]   God gives all His children all they need
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.480]   to live godly lives, but, and it's a big but,
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.840]   His children must apply themselves
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.440]   and be diligent to use the means of grace He has provided.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.160]   I need to tell you today,
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.600]   spiritual growth is not automatic.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.760]   It requires cooperation with God
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.920]   and the application of spiritual diligence and discipline.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.560]   We've put up on the screen seven characteristics
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.520]   of the godly life, but we must not think of them
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.320]   as seven beads on a string,
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.840]   or even seven stages of development.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.880]   The word translated add here
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   really means to supply generously.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.640]   In other words, we develop one quality
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   as we exercise another.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.280]   These graces relate to each other
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.520]   the way the branch relates to the trunk
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.440]   and the twigs to the branch.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.400]   Like the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5,
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.200]   these qualities grow out of life
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.240]   and out of a vital relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.960]   It is not enough to let go and let God.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.880]   You know, it's a popular thing, a petition.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.200]   As though spiritual growth was God's work alone.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.960]   Literally Peter said,
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.440]   "Make every effort to bring alongside."
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.000]   And we have a picture here
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.240]   of the father and the child working together.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:08.760]   Seven qualities that result from faith,
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.800]   goodness, knowledge, self-control, perseverance,
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.360]   godliness, mutual goodness and love.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.160]   It is impossible for fallen human nature
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.080]   to manufacture these seven qualities of Christian character.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.880]   They must be produced by the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.600]   Now to be sure, there are unsaved people
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.520]   who possess amazing self-control and perseverance.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.680]   But these virtues point to them and not to the Lord.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.920]   They get the glory.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.880]   When God produces the beautiful nature
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.680]   of His Son in a Christian,
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.560]   it is God who receives the praise and the glory.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.120]   Because we have this divine nature,
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.000]   we can grow spiritually
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.080]   and develop this kind of Christian character.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:01.520]   And so my third point,
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.360]   the Christian life begins with faith.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:09.160]   Faith results in spiritual growth.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.480]   And spiritual growth brings practical results.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.080]   Let's read on.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.040]   Verse eight, "For if you possess these qualities
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.520]   in increasing measure,
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.000]   they will keep you from being ineffective
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.760]   and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.680]   For whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind,
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.240]   forgetting they have been cleansed from their past sins.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   Therefore, my brothers and sisters,
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.200]   make every effort to confirm your calling and election.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.720]   For if you do these things, you will never stumble
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.800]   and you will receive a rich welcome
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.800]   into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.680]   But the big question is,
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.280]   how can the believer be certain
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.640]   that he is growing spiritually?
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:09.760]   Peter gives three evidences here in verses eight and nine
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.040]   of true spiritual growth.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.880]   Number one, fruitfulness in verse eight.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:20.640]   Christian character is an end in itself,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.160]   but it is also a means to an end.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.640]   The more we become like Jesus Christ,
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.840]   the more the Spirit can use us in witness and service.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:38.360]   Peter tells us that the believer who is not growing
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.920]   is ineffective and unproductive.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.920]   His knowledge of Jesus Christ
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.560]   is producing nothing practical in his life.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.720]   I need to tell you that some of the most effective Christians
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   I have known are people without dramatic talents
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:02.640]   and special abilities or even exciting personalities.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.640]   Yet God has used them in a marvellous way.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.960]   Why?
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.760]   Because they are becoming more and more like Jesus Christ.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.080]   They have the kind of character and conduct
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.640]   that God can trust with blessing.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.160]   They are fruitful because they've been faithful.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.360]   They are effective because they are growing
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.480]   in their Christian experience.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:31.600]   These beautiful qualities of character do exist within us
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.200]   because we possess the divine nature.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:42.060]   We must cultivate them so that they increase
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:47.060]   and produce fruit in and through our lives.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:52.120]   That is why God has been speaking to the staff here
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.400]   about being gardeners, producing fruit,
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.880]   cultivating fruit in and through our lives.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.240]   Secondly, vision.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.720]   The unsaved person is in the dark
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.220]   because Satan has blinded his mind.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:13.600]   A person has to be born again before his eyes are open
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.480]   and we can see the kingdom of God.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:20.000]   But after our eyes are open,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.720]   it's important that we increase our vision
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.840]   and see all that what God wants us to see.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.440]   Nearsighted, if I take this off.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.240]   Nearsighted is a picture of someone closing
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.960]   or squinting their eyes,
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.960]   unable to see at a distance.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.080]   Jesus admonished his disciples,
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.360]   "Lift up your eyes and look to the fields.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.880]   They are already white to the harvest."
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.080]   I say to you tonight, church, lift up your eyes
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.520]   and look outside this building here in Admiralty.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.160]   The fields are white.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.600]   For the harvest.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.600]   You remember the Revelation series, dear church?
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.360]   I believe that some congregations today
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.520]   are like the church in Lydus here.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.560]   They are so proud they have been made rich
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.480]   and increased with goods and they have need of nothing.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.960]   And they do not realise they are wretched,
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.240]   miserable, poor, blind and naked.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.280]   It's a tragedy to be spiritually nearsighted,
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:39.200]   but it's even greater tragedy to be blind.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:45.720]   My friends, this church, KFCI, is a church with a mission.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.240]   Let's cultivate gratitude in our hearts
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.760]   and sharpen our spiritual vision.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:58.800]   Life is too brief and the needs of the world are too great
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.700]   for God's people to be walking around with their eye closed.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.820]   And thirdly, security.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:13.300]   The growing Christian walks with confidence
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.940]   because he knows, he knows he is secure in Christ.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:23.440]   Peter pointed out the calling and election go together.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.520]   You'll see in the text.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.180]   The same God who elects his people
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.020]   also ordains the means to call them.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.100]   The two must go together.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:37.760]   Peter pointed out the election is no excuse
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.900]   for spiritual immaturity
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:46.360]   or for the lack of effort in the Christian life.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.940]   In fact, Peter, as in verse five,
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.660]   uses the expression time and time again, make every effort.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.300]   And whilst it's true that God must work in us
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.180]   before we can do His will,
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.100]   it is also true that we must be willing for God to work
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.080]   and we must cooperate with Him.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:11.900]   Divine election must never be an excuse
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.660]   for human laziness.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.620]   Can I say it again?
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.740]   Divine election must never be an excuse
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.300]   for human laziness.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.980]   A Christian who is sure of his election and calling
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.220]   will never stumble,
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.620]   but will prove through a consistent life
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.420]   that he is truly a child of God.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:36.700]   In fact, the growing Christian
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:42.620]   can look forward to an abundant entrance
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.380]   into the eternal kingdom.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:48.160]   The Greeks use this phrase to describe the welcome given
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.140]   to Olympic winners when they return home.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:54.540]   I believe with my whole heart,
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:58.260]   if we make a lavish provision to grow spiritually,
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.980]   God will make lavish provision for us when we enter heaven.
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:06.860]   Just think of the blessings
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.060]   that the growing Christians enjoy.
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:15.460]   Fruitfulness, vision, security,
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.140]   and heaven's best.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:23.200]   All this and heaven too.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.720]   The rest of 2 Peter 1,
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.680]   I haven't got time to talk about tonight,
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.680]   speaks about Christ's glory and the prophetic words.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:39.880]   Peter contrasts the truth about Christ revealed by God
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.120]   with the falsehood of man-made myths.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.920]   I believe that an important quality for a shepherd
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.760]   is to hear the voice of God.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   As your leaders, we are committed to hearing God's voice.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:02.560]   A year ago, almost exactly a year ago,
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.160]   I felt God say to me,
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.160]   "Call a three-day fast for Hong Kong
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.400]   "and preach the book of Esther."
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.360]   Others had a similar call about the fast,
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.160]   and literally hundreds of thousands of Christians
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.120]   around the world fasted and prayed for our city.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.080]   I remember one morning getting up early
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.280]   and speaking to 92 pastors in New York City
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.580]   about the fast that we're having in Hong Kong.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.680]   But a word of warning,
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:39.680]   please test anything we or anyone else says
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.580]   that we claim is from God.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:47.040]   Discern whether it is in fact from God.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   And Peter tells us this at the end of chapter one,
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.600]   "For prophecy never had its origin in the human will,
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.400]   "but prophets through humans spoke from God
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.640]   "as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.960]   And that's a plug for James
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.320]   because James will next week be speaking to us
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   about Peter's warning on false prophets and false teachers.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:18.680]   But I wanna conclude by saying, by repeating,
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.540]   the Christian life begins with faith.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:28.280]   But that faith must lead to spiritual growth,
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.640]   otherwise it's dead faith.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.840]   And dead faith is not saving faith.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.720]   Faith leads to growth,
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.480]   and growth leads to practical results in life and service.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.000]   And I would tell you that people
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.260]   who have this kind of Christian experience,
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:54.980]   are not likely to fall prey to false teachers.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:32:00.200]   Could you stand up as I ask the band to come back, please?
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:14.940]   Even what the enemy meant for evil,
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:20.420]   he turns it for our good and for his glory.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:25.000]   I'm gonna ask you all to do one very simple thing,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.800]   it's really simple tonight, okay?
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.060]   And if you're in one of the overflow rooms,
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.260]   or even if you're sitting at home,
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.980]   maybe you could just get up for a moment.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.820]   I'm gonna ask you, each one of you,
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.660]   to just take a step of faith.
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.180]   And what we're gonna do literally,
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.740]   I've worked out if we're socially distanced,
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.620]   and we all take a step of faith,
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.540]   we will still be socially distanced, right?
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.300]   So don't take two steps of faith, okay?
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.460]   Now, I think sometimes it's very important,
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.940]   sometimes to enact this, to say to God,
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.660]   "Look, I am willing, whatever it is,
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.200]   "to take this step of faith,
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.740]   "because I believe that this faith
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.940]   "will be the thing that leads me into your presence,
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.880]   "will lead me to your promises,
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.180]   "will lead me to the things that you have for me."
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.180]   And I believe as we do it together, as KFCI,
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.380]   God has got great plans for us.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:25.420]   And I have to say, we've gone through this COVID period,
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.860]   we've gone through all this, and we're here tonight,
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.260]   and there are people online,
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.220]   and God has got great plans for us.
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:36.660]   But we have to take that step of faith together.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.020]   So on the count of three, we're gonna do that,
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.620]   we're gonna take a step of faith,
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.820]   and then James is gonna lead us in this song.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.540]   And let's declare it tonight.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.700]   Even what the enemy meant for evil,
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.340]   you turn it for our good and for your glory.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.580]   One, two, three.
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.840]   Father, we take this step of faith together.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:04.340]   We believe, Lord, that faith leads to life.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.700]   God, give us a life, Lord.
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.700]   There's a life that is following you.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.820]   Lord, may we fulfil the destiny,
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.500]   the promise you have for each one of us as individuals,
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:23.500]   and us as a church, as we take this step of faith together.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:27.180]   In Jesus' name, and everybody said, amen.
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.500]   Let's declare it together.
