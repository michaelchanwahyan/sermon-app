[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.600]   I love traveling on the MTR.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:24.720]   Besides the privilege as an old man of traveling for $2, no, $1.90, it is generally the fastest
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.040]   way to get from A to B in Hong Kong.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.200]   Sandra and I used it tonight.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:42.960]   For me, one of the greatest things about our MTR system, it is well signposted.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.800]   There is always a clear way out.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:57.440]   If we come to Admiralty Station, whether I want to go to Star Street or Lippo Center,
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.320]   there is a clearly marked exit.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.040]   Even here at KFCI, we have a clearly marked exit.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.920]   See ya.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.400]   My message tonight is simple.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.520]   The main way out is to stay out.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.460]   Shall I repeat that?
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:36.000]   The main way out is to stay out.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.920]   Back again.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.840]   I have a confession.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.680]   I dream a lot these days.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.480]   I mean, after all, the Bible says, doesn't it, old man, dream dreams.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.840]   I dream a lot these days.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.880]   I must say that my dreams are usually not like spooky dreams or nightmares.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.360]   My dreams are not usually eureka moments.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.440]   They're not usually, although sometimes deep spiritual revelations.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440]   I want to take you back a few weeks ago.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.360]   I was in a deep sleep.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.120]   I dreamt I was in a sort of jungle area.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:35.760]   I was in full hiking gear, you know, sponsored by North Face, with a well-packed rucksack
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.600]   on my back.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.480]   The going was tough.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.440]   And in my dream, I was all alone.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:57.060]   I didn't notice I'd strayed into some sandy-looking terrain.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.520]   The ground felt spongy.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:16.920]   For one step, two step, suddenly, it gave way.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.160]   I was up to my knees in quicksand.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.900]   And the picture will show you that Indiana Jones knows all about it.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.120]   It's wet.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.120]   It's shifting.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.600]   I was stuck and very slowly going down.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.080]   I shouted for help.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.920]   Thank goodness I didn't wake Sandra.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.000]   But no one was around.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.600]   I fought to free myself, but I couldn't reach anything to lift myself up.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.720]   I didn't even have a snake like Indiana Jones.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.460]   Very soon, I was trapped up to my thighs.
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.600]   And I was slowly continuing to sink.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.680]   I was trapped.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.200]   I was panicking.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.520]   Another hour goes by.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.400]   Another hour.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.960]   Still another hour.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:36.840]   I seem to remember in my dream that the sun was scorching overhead.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.360]   I vowed not to give up.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.640]   But I was growing exhausted.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:52.120]   The harder I fought, the more the quicksand weighed me down.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.540]   Now I'd heard somewhere that struggling only makes you sink faster.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:09.680]   So even I kid you not, as I lay in my bed, I was trying to be still.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.700]   But it was past my waist now.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.080]   My body was firmly wedged in the trap.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.840]   Another hour goes by.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.920]   And another hour.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.520]   It was up to my chest.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.680]   I barely had the energy to kick anymore.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.000]   I could hardly move.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.760]   Now you might describe this dream as a bit of a nightmare.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.560]   But fortunately, the alarm went off.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.920]   Shortly after, it was time for work.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.640]   Now here's a startling fact about quicksand.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.160]   Due to the physics of shifting sand and weight distribution, the grains of sand that you
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:12.920]   trap almost always jam up and bind together before you sink too far.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.640]   It's a phenomenon that's caused any scientists here.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.640]   It's called force chain.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:26.840]   And unlike what you see in the movies, you won't suddenly be sucked in over your head.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.880]   In the real world, you could sink a long way down, particularly if you struggle.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.920]   And yes, you definitely can die in the quicksand.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.960]   Yet people seldom die from sinking and suffocation as you might think.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.800]   Instead, what do they die from?
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   They die from exhaustion.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.440]   From the effects of desperation and exposure.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:06.560]   They die because they wear themselves out, desperately trying to escape.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.400]   Now what has this got to do with our sermon?
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.200]   Wow.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:21.440]   When it comes to fighting sin, the same can be true.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:28.840]   Many of us are floundering in poor choices.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:36.240]   For years, we've battled against the spiral of sin and temptation that Johnny told us
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.880]   about.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.560]   We've been battling as though it were quicksand.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:50.680]   But what it's doing, it is sucking us down.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:58.680]   We keep struggling, but we can't seem to climb onto solid ground.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:08.280]   Now in desperation, we lapse, we panic, we lapse into spiritual exhaustion.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.800]   It seems no matter what we try, we can't free ourselves.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:24.600]   And it feels like we've reached a point that we can't fight anymore.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.760]   And you identify with this because I can.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:35.080]   We're about an inch from giving up.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.400]   But guess what?
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.840]   You do not need to be swallowed up in the quicksand of sin.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.980]   Can I say it again?
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:55.600]   You do not need to be swallowed up in the quicksand of sin.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:05.120]   Surrounded, clothed, secure, new.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:12.640]   These are four words to describe a Christ follower.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.640]   We just sang it.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.860]   By the way, you sang it beautifully.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.180]   We just sang it.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:22.220]   You have victory in Christ.
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:27.220]   Jesus has already won.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.220]   Hebrews 12, 2 says,
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:36.780]   He is seated in the place of victory at the right hand of God.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:46.260]   And when eternity unfolds, Jesus will not return to earth to fight sin again.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:53.060]   He will return as the ultimate victor.
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.020]   Now because Jesus has already won the victory over sin,
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.220]   you have access to that victory too.
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:12.220]   You are freed from sin's quicksand by living in your new identity.
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:24.860]   Sin, temptation and a poor fort life don't need to hold you down.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:33.620]   The power to live freely comes from your close association with Christ and His victory.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.020]   Let's pause on that for a moment.
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:48.780]   The power to live freely comes from your close association with Christ and His victory.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:54.900]   Now let me be clear how the battle isn't won because pressure lifts from our life
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.020]   or because circumstances change.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:06.340]   Week after week, we have seen this in Psalm 23 verses 4 and 5.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:12.740]   Verse 4 tells us we will still walk through dark valleys.
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:20.980]   We will walk through dark valleys our entire life.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:28.740]   Verse 5 says, we will still sit at the table and be surrounded by our enemies.
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.780]   Remember in week one, I got you, you are the enemies.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:41.560]   We will still sit for the rest of our life at this table and be surrounded by our enemies.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:49.580]   The battle is won by who it is who walks with us through the dark valley
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:12:00.900]   and who it is who sits at the table with us when we are surrounded by trouble and by our enemies.
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:08.020]   Now what does it mean to be associated with Christ and His victory?
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:13.380]   Let us use Scripture to unpack this concept.
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:23.100]   For a start, I put on the screen 2 Corinthians 5 17 says we are in Christ.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:29.060]   It says we are a new creation.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:36.080]   Galatians 3 26 to 27 says that we are clothed.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.220]   We are clothed with Christ.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:51.380]   It means that Jesus makes us brand new and we are completely enfolded by the righteousness of Christ.
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:59.260]   Colossians 3 3 tells us our lives are hidden with Christ.
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:04.820]   Now what I mean by that, Sandra and I have some important documents at home.
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:14.940]   They are locked in a filing box and that box is stored in a secret location
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.580]   at the top of a cupboard in our bedroom.
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:26.860]   I guess it's not secret anymore.
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:36.020]   But what I'm saying is that our brand new righteousness isn't fleeting.
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:42.020]   It's protected and safe like our filing box.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:51.500]   Train your mind, train your heart to believe that you are a new creation.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:58.100]   Your righteousness is safe because of that.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:03.220]   And there's more in Ephesians 2 6.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:10.620]   God raised us up with Christ and seated us in the heavenly places.
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.180]   That means that we are united with Christ in victory.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:21.740]   Whatever Jesus has won, we have won.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:30.860]   God Almighty took on the role of a human who took the weight of the world's sins on the cross.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.660]   Jesus suffered and died and was raised to life again.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:40.260]   That is what has won the battle.
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:46.500]   1 Corinthians 15 57 says, "Thanks be to God."
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:52.780]   He gives us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:15:08.820]   My friend, train your mind and your heart to see yourself as victorious in Christ.
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.420]   When temptations threaten us, which they will do,
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:20.620]   we first become free by changing our perspectives.
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:27.660]   Instead of floundering in the quicksand of sin and temptation for the rest of our lives,
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.180]   we change how we think.
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.540]   We take responsibility for what happens in our minds.
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.140]   And we say, "I am in Christ and Christ is in me.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.300]   I am a brand new creation.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:50.620]   Christ is the victor and I can adopt a mindset that sees me walking in all the victory Jesus has won for me."
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:58.780]   Your new mindset tells you that God is faithful.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.660]   You remind yourself of this truth.
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:06.540]   You remind yourself and you remind yourself again.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:12.340]   This constant reminding begins to change the old patterns,
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.460]   the patterns that led you to defeat.
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:23.660]   Sin is not the end of the story anymore.
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:35.460]   Faithful God promised a way out, an exit, a way out of temptation.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:42.220]   True to His promise, He provides the way out
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:49.100]   so that you can and you will escape this temptation.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.380]   You can walk through the dark valleys.
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.700]   You can sit at the presence of your enemies
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.980]   with a different way of thinking about what God has for you.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:11.020]   1 John 5, 4 says, "Everyone born of God overcomes the world."
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.980]   I can hear what you're saying.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.660]   I understand that.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.420]   You know, but wise guy, how do we do it?
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:24.060]   You always tell me in church what to do, but you don't tell me how to do it.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:30.020]   How do I refuse the enemy to be a seat at my table?
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.740]   Well, you must start.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:36.580]   You must start from this place of identity.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:42.260]   Jesus has already won your struggle.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.180]   And because those of you who are Christ followers are joined with Him,
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:51.100]   something powerful must have already happened.
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:57.020]   Whatever He has won, you have won.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:04.980]   Since Christ has victory, you have access to that victory right now.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:11.100]   You are not fighting the battle against sin in your own strength.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.580]   Look at Philippians 3.10, I'll put it on the screen.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:22.340]   You are tapping into the engine of God's resurrection power.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.940]   It really isn't very complicated.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:31.100]   It all boils down to God's faithfulness.
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.380]   Look again at this verse, 1 Corinthians 10, 13.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.420]   "No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man."
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.580]   We are all tempted.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:45.860]   We're all in the same boat.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:54.340]   God is faithful and will not let you be tempted beyond your ability.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:19:00.820]   But with the temptation, He will also provide a way out, an exit sign,
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:08.740]   a way of escape that you may be able to endure it.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.940]   It's that straightforward.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.900]   It's so straightforward, I want to read it again.
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.100]   "No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man."
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.620]   God is faithful and He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability.
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:26.380]   But with the temptation, He will also provide the way of escape
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.060]   that you'll be able to enjoy it.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.620]   My friends, God is faithful.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:42.660]   When you rely on Him, He will provide a way out.
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:48.340]   I want to push this a little bit further.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:56.380]   When you face temptation, it's like you're staring at a big closed door.
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:05.700]   The door is unlocked and on the other side of the door is sin,
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.060]   some sort of harmful living.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:16.780]   Many believers look at that door and don't believe they have any power
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.340]   to keep the door shut.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:28.180]   They believe that it must open the door marked temptation and walk through it.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:35.900]   They don't feel like they have a choice.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.780]   I actually believe that a big part of the problem is found in the church
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.580]   and some of the stuff that we teach.
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:53.780]   So much of today's church teaching is what I call flawed identity theology.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.140]   Now, here's the big revelation.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:01.540]   We are not simply sinners saved by grace.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.100]   We must change this distorted thinking.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.740]   We are not simply beggars helping other beggars to find bread.
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.460]   We are not simply come to the cross with nothing to offer.
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:22.020]   Now, true, this may be and indeed should be the starting point,
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:28.980]   but it's not the whole story and it's not our true identity if we are in Christ.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:34.180]   We are not just a big bunch of sinners.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:39.100]   Yet the problem is we hear this and variations of this over and over
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:43.700]   in today's churches.
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:48.700]   Pastors say something like, "Hi, welcome to church today.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.820]   We're so glad you're here.
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.260]   Please sit down and enjoy today's service.
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.940]   Never forget you're a sinner.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.220]   That's all you are.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.140]   You came to Jesus with empty hands.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.300]   That's all you ever offer Him.
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.140]   You're clutching filthy rags.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:10.980]   You're a worm.
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:15.860]   You're a wretch, a mocker, a scoffer, unclean.
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.020]   You're always in rebellion against God.
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.940]   You're utterly devoid of value.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.780]   You're only a sinner saved by grace.
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:30.180]   And if you ever forget it, remember how you sinned this morning
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:35.220]   and you sinned last night and actually you sinned 10 minutes ago.
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.860]   That's all you ever do.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.260]   Okay, let's stand and sing.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.420]   See you again next Sunday.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.260]   Now, I admit this is more than a little bit OTT.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.460]   But have you ever heard something like this?
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.140]   And I'm sure we all have.
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:55.660]   It's horrible identity theology.
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:01.060]   When you hear it, it's hard to do anything else except nod
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:05.100]   and say to yourself, "Yes, I guess it's true."
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.300]   When you walk up to the big door, mark temptation,
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.460]   you don't stand a chance.
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:16.020]   You open the door and walk through it
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.660]   since that's what you've been conditioned to do.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:25.860]   You don't think you have any options
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:30.860]   except to wallow in the sin that is on the other side
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.700]   because you've been following a partial gospel.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.980]   Now, let me be clear.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:43.140]   Whilst it is true that after we begin to follow Jesus,
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.220]   our hearts are still capable of sinning.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.620]   Yet Jesus has made them brand new.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.220]   His Word, Ezekiel.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.500]   God said this,
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.180]   "I will give you a new heart and a new spirit
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.220]   I will put in you.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.180]   And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.900]   and give you a heart of flesh."
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.100]   Now we can get confused on this issue
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.140]   because even after we are new creations,
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.500]   we still have capacity to sin.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.900]   All of us.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.500]   You don't need me to tell you this.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.500]   But you don't need a sermon like the one I referred to earlier
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.900]   you know it only too well.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.900]   What you do need to hear is this.
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:35.420]   Sinner is no longer your identity.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:42.940]   Sinner is no longer your identity.
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:48.020]   So we stare at the door that's marked temptation.
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.900]   We need to remind ourselves
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.380]   that we were crucified with Christ
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.740]   and we don't need to live the way we used to.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.420]   Galatians 2.20 says,
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.180]   "The life you live now is by faith
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.860]   because Christ lives in you."
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.020]   When you became a believer,
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.660]   you were baptised into Christ Jesus
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.860]   which means you identified with His death,
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.460]   His burial and His resurrection.
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.340]   We will be celebrating this on August the 28th
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.060]   at Repulse Bay Beach.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.980]   Paul says this to the Romans,
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.380]   "We were buried therefore with Him by baptism into death.
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.340]   In order that just as Christ was raised from the dead
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.180]   by the glory of the Father,
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:41.260]   we too may walk in the newness of life."
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.940]   That's who you are today.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.780]   You don't need to walk through the door
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.340]   that's called temptation.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.300]   In short,
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:01.020]   you are a saint.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.820]   Does it surprise you
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:11.860]   that the Bible calls you a saint?
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.100]   Maybe you hear the word
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.980]   and you think about people like Mother Teresa.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.660]   You know, she was a saint, but me on the other hand.
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.220]   But it's true.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.180]   This is how you are referred to in Scripture.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.060]   Saint simply means you are a holy one.
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.620]   And can I tell you,
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:35.260]   there are more than 40 verses in the New Testament
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.900]   that call us saints.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:43.220]   In Christ, you have been forgiven all sins,
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.300]   past, present and future.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.100]   You have a righteous standing before God.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.380]   You are clothed in the righteousness of His Son, Jesus.
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.300]   Don't walk through the door, temptation.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.540]   You are a saint.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.580]   And here is a list of some saints.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.180]   I bet you've never been to any of their churches.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.020]   Look.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.860]   If I've missed your name, sorry.
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:14.020]   Saints.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.700]   Saints, can I call you that?
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.980]   I need to tell you something.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.500]   There is always a way out.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:30.100]   Let's go back to my Admiralty MTR station.
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.740]   I love it, you know I do, right?
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.300]   Red line, blue line, little green line, light green line
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.180]   and soon to be added, sharting line.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.460]   Suppose it was your first time there.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.740]   You're a visitor.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.140]   Do you remember visitors?
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.220]   It's what we used to have in the past, right?
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.900]   You know, you're a visitor.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:54.900]   It's confusing, but eventually because of the exit signs,
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.940]   we will eventually see daylight.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:03.660]   God offers us similar signage.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.220]   He is always faithful.
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.660]   He is always true.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.140]   Let's look at Corinthians 1:10 again.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:14.020]   No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man.
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:17.580]   God is faithful and He will not let you be tempted
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.860]   beyond your ability.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.220]   But with the temptation,
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.660]   He will also provide the way of escape
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.780]   that you may be able to endure it.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:33.340]   If you want a way out, God is faithful.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.220]   The Holy Spirit will give you a way out.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:40.100]   And then the Holy Spirit will give you another way out.
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.220]   And in His mercy, He will give you another way out.
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.420]   The doorways may become smaller and smaller
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.780]   the further you go along.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.780]   The way out is more difficult to take
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.340]   because you're further along the pathway
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.420]   and the potential consequences
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.740]   if you opt not to take the way out become more serious.
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:03.340]   I wanna tell you about a story happened in my life
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.740]   in the late 80s.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:09.020]   I went on a business trip to Taiwan.
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.940]   We were looking to expand business up there
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.860]   and this gentleman took us up.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.740]   He was gonna introduce us so many contacts in Taiwan
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.860]   and during the day we had so many business meetings.
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.700]   And I could just tell from the tenor
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.540]   of the way he was going
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.260]   that the evening was gonna be difficult
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:35.060]   because he was expecting to go and play.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:41.100]   And I'd heard about what people do when they play in Taiwan
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:45.340]   and I'm really praying desperately about this.
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.900]   And anyway, there were three of us.
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.660]   We went out to dinner.
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.180]   We started talking about this
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:55.180]   and I'm thinking, "God, there's gotta be a way out of this."
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:59.980]   And so after dinner, we got into a taxi
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.260]   and I thought, "Here we go."
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:10.460]   The first stop of the taxi was my hotel.
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.780]   He said, "We thought we'd drop you off first
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.820]   "so that we could go out."
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.820]   So actually, while I don't know
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.580]   what these two guys were doing in Taiwan,
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.460]   but whatever they were doing,
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.060]   I was in my room with Fox movies
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.660]   or whatever it was, HBO with a cold beer.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:32.380]   God had given me a way out of that situation.
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.420]   I did not want to go down that route.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:39.380]   And if we look closely,
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.100]   the opportunities to take the way out are still there.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.900]   If you're in a situation at the moment,
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:50.580]   the opportunities to take a way out are still there.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.860]   I mean, the first doorway might be a regular sized door
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.380]   that you find in any house.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.940]   The second door might be a pet sized door
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.340]   that people cut for, let their dog or cat out.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:09.140]   The third doorway is maybe a teeny tiny Barbie house doorway
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.460]   that only your smartphone will slide through.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:17.420]   But you can still win the battle.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:22.940]   You don't have to give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.740]   You can get out.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:34.500]   The other way, the other main out, way out,
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:39.500]   is to simply stop gazing at the doormark temptation.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:46.540]   Go in a different direction completely.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:51.660]   Exchange the doormark temptation
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.860]   for a door marked invitation.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:02.620]   Focus on a different door, the door of Christ.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.220]   I wanna read this from Hebrews.
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.020]   Therefore, since we are surrounded
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.260]   by so great a cloud of witnesses,
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.740]   let us also lay aside every weight and sin
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:19.180]   which clings so closely and let us run with endurance
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.220]   the race that is set before us,
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:26.220]   looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith,
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.180]   who for the joy that was set before Him,
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.540]   endured the cross, despising the shame
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.660]   and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:41.660]   My friends, the core message of the gospel is not don't sin,
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:47.020]   which is often preached
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:49.020]   'cause it lands with a bit of a punch, right?
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.220]   It's good for preachers to preach don't sin.
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:57.180]   But the message of the cross is less about don't sin
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.660]   and much more come walk with me.
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.740]   Can you see that?
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:08.140]   The gospel message is that through the work of Christ,
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.420]   our sins are forgiven.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:14.580]   We are new creations
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.940]   and we can step into a relationship with God.
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:22.340]   Jesus offers us abundant life, which means life to the full.
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:27.860]   Let's go back to Psalm 23.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:34.860]   The point of this Psalm is that God promises to guide you.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:41.980]   Just as sheep learn to recognise the voice of the shepherd,
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:46.020]   we are all given the ability to hear the voice of Christ.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.540]   We can see what the shepherd is doing.
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.540]   We can rest in the shepherd's care.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.260]   We can move in step with the shepherds.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:59.540]   As you live closely with Jesus, you can trust God.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.100]   You can look at your life.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.500]   I know I have and seen the times He's carried you,
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.780]   the times He's pulled you close,
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.220]   the times He's kept you out of danger,
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.100]   navigated you through.
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:19.780]   Intimacy with God is the way to true fulfilment.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:25.340]   How do you keep the enemy from sitting at your table?
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:29.060]   You keep your eyes on the enemy.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.860]   You keep your eyes on Christ.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:36.220]   This is where Adam and Eve went wrong.
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:40.300]   They knew what it was like to walk with God.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.940]   They were made in the image of God.
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:49.060]   They knew what it was like to have a relationship with God
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.340]   and to do God's work on earth with God.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:35:00.420]   That was the larger gospel as Adam and Eve understood it.
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.740]   And there was a definite command, don't sin.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.820]   But there was a larger good news that said,
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.580]   come and enjoy God.
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:13.780]   That larger gospel is extended to you today.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:22.040]   If you are a Christian, you're saved.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.300]   But has God been more to you than a command not to sin?
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.900]   Is God larger to you than a ticket to heaven when you die?
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.980]   Oh, it's good you're saved.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.780]   It's good you're forgiven.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.420]   It's good you're going to heaven.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.260]   Yet beyond that truth,
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.580]   God is greatly interested in you knowing Him.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.540]   He's interested in Him, you knowing Him right now
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.940]   before you get to heaven.
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:06.200]   I wanna ask you a question.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:12.900]   How well do you actually know God?
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:18.220]   There should be a picture on the screen.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.900]   When you are on a pathway to knowing God,
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:28.500]   it means you set your heart, mind and purpose
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.420]   in that direction.
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.620]   When you begin to learn His Word, the Bible,
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.020]   you get to know Him and His character.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.860]   When you walk with Him in continual prayer,
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.580]   you learn His ways, His words,
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.820]   His ways and character fill your life.
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.500]   Do you have a need for worth?
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.820]   Do you have a need for significance,
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:02.100]   for purpose, for love, for peace,
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.620]   for the closest kind of companionship,
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.940]   for calm in the midst of a storm?
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:14.220]   My friends, it is Jesus who fulfills those needs.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:22.020]   But they are all the same needs
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.380]   that the enemy is exploiting.
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:31.180]   When you feel down, it's usually because
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.780]   that those needs of yours are not being met.
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:39.540]   And then just then the enemy comes along and whispers,
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.860]   "If you want to feel better,
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.940]   go through this door marked temptation.
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:53.540]   Does this doormat mark temptation?
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:57.340]   I'll give you a thrill.
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:02.260]   I'll give you a rush of adrenaline."
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:09.060]   My friends, nothing can satisfy your heart like God.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.660]   Nothing keeps you from sin
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.860]   better than keeping your eyes on Christ.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:21.580]   Walking with God, you discover your true identity,
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.220]   worth and purpose.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.940]   That's where you discover you can trust God.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:32.300]   I wanna finish by talking about baby zebras.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:36.740]   Apologies if you come from America, baby zebras.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.700]   What zebras or zebras do with their young,
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.580]   when a mama zebra gives birth,
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:49.340]   the first thing she does is to take her child away
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.420]   from the rest of the herd for a while.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:59.580]   Because the mother wants her child to learn to know her.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:04.900]   Now to the untrained eye, I'm sure the same as me,
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.420]   zebras look the same, right?
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:12.140]   Even baby zebras have been known to mix up who their mum is.
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:17.300]   But every zebra has a unique pattern of markings
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.900]   on its head and face.
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:23.980]   When mother zebra takes her baby away like that,
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:28.980]   the baby learns to identify exactly who her mother is.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:33.860]   The child can see and hear its mother.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:38.860]   It begins to recognise its mother's individual markings.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:43.100]   Weeks and weeks, it's just mother and child,
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.580]   mother and child, mother and child, mother and child.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:52.580]   Soon enough, the baby zebra is brought back to the herd.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:58.140]   The baby has learned a remarkable discernment.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:02.900]   It can see all those other animals that look and sound
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.820]   and smell almost the same.
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.660]   And it can say, "Ah, not that one.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.420]   Not that one.
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.180]   Not that one.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.420]   Ah, that one."
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:18.500]   Now, why do I talk about zebras?
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:24.340]   That is the level of familiarity and recognition.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.180]   It's where God wants you to be with Him.
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:33.820]   God wants you to know Him without a doubt.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:41.260]   The enemy wants to lead you astray so he can destroy you.
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:48.500]   But Jesus wants you to know the voice of the Father,
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:54.740]   God's voice, to recognise God and to trust God.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:03.540]   The quicksand has no more power.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:10.300]   The door marked temptation has no more appeal.
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.900]   You are set free.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:19.500]   You can win the battle for your mind.
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:27.660]   My friends, you are invited to deeply
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:32.660]   and closely know God.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:36.420]   Can we have the band back, please?
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.580]   (sighing)
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:42:03.820]   A question you might be asking yourself.
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.340]   (soft piano music)
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.380]   What do I do now?
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:16.180]   I want you to think of that baby zebra for a minute.
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:24.420]   That baby zebra knows who her mum is.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.380]   It's mum.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.780]   It won't be fooled by imitations.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:44.420]   My heart tonight is that we would know exactly how God is
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.900]   and who He is.
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:51.580]   And that we would run to Him
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:55.820]   just as that baby zebra would run to its mum.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.740]   (soft piano music)
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:07.020]   I wanna give an opportunity for anyone here
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.340]   who is watching online
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:16.820]   who maybe yet would say they're not yet a Christ follower.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.740]   (soft piano music)
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.740]   I wanna give you an opportunity tonight
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.740]   to surrender your life to Jesus Christ.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.660]   (soft piano music)
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:35.660]   I wanna give you an opportunity tonight
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.660]   to surrender your life to Jesus Christ.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.580]   (soft piano music)
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.580]   Here's the one who went to the cross
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.580]   (soft piano music)
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:52.580]   and died a sinner's death so that you could be free.
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:01.580]   I wanna give you an opportunity tonight
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.580]   to surrender your life to Jesus Christ.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.420]   (soft piano music)
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:19.500]   I just wonder if you would pray with me.
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:22.420]   (soft piano music)
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:26.500]   Dear Jesus,
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:31.500]   I come to you now
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.500]   because I've tried to find the way out,
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:42.500]   but it keeps leading me back to the same place.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:50.500]   Thank you that you went to the cross for me.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.500]   Thank you, Lord, I don't have to look
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:00.500]   at the doormark temptation
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.500]   because there's a doormark invitation.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.500]   And I choose tonight to walk through that door
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:07.500]   called invitation.
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.500]   I surrender my life.
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:18.500]   Come into my life.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.500]   Forgive my sins.
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.500]   And help me to live the life
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.500]   that deep down I've always wanted to live.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:33.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:34.500]   A life of freedom
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.500]   because I know the victory is yours.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.500]   Amen.
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.500]   If you prayed that prayer tonight,
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.500]   please tell someone if you're online,
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.500]   maybe drop us an email.
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.500]   For the rest of us, can we stand?
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.500]   I just really got four words
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:08.500]   for us tonight
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:12.500]   in terms of what God is telling us to do.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.500]   And they're very simple.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:21.500]   Run to the Father.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:27.500]   Run to the Father.
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.500]   There you'll find acceptance.
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.500]   There you'll find the love you were looking for.
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.500]   You don't need to go through the doormark temptation
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.500]   to find love.
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.500]   Run to the Father.
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:49.500]   There you'll find the worth
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.500]   that you've been looking for.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.500]   You don't need to go running
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.500]   through that door.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.500]   You don't need to keep looking at people in the world
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.500]   that so-called made it,
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.500]   the rich, the famous,
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:12.500]   beautiful.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:17.500]   At least it's beauty portrayed on a magazine
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.500]   or a social media site.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.500]   You can find all of those things
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.500]   at the heart of the Father
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.500]   because actually at the heart of the Father,
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:28.500]   there is a Son, Jesus.
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.500]   Who loved you and died for you.
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:40.500]   Can you just open your hands in front of you?
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:43.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:47.500]   Father, I pray that tonight
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:51.500]   we would know what acceptance is.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.500]   We would know what love is.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.500]   We would know what worth is.
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:15.500]   And Lord, that you show each one of us we have a choice.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.500]   We pray in the Lord's prayer,
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.500]   deliver us from evil.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.500]   For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory.
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:35.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.500]   Lord, help us in the times of trial.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.500]   Help us in the times of temptations.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.500]   Help us in the times when we're walking
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.500]   through the dark valley.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.500]   Help us in the times when the enemy
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.500]   is trying to sit at our table.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.500]   I choose tonight
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.500]   to run to the Father
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:01.500]   and to find His acceptance.
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:04.500]   (soft piano music)
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.500]   Let's sing that together as a church.
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.500]   (soft piano music)
