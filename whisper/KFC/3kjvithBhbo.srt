1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
 I wish I was talking to you face to face, but hey, I offer technology.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,760
 I want to start at the very beginning.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:23,920
 I want to look at the very first book of the Bible, in fact, the second chapter.

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:32,880
 And look at this verse, the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,520
 it and take care of it.

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,800
 Yes, work was God's idea.

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,120
 Work was God's idea.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,640
 God created mankind to work and are created in his image.

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,320
 Work should be considered a blessing.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:07,160
 But what you might not appreciate is just how much I am excited by the whole subject

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,280
 of workplace and faith.

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:21,080
 One caveat, my heart is so full, I will not be able to do it justice in one sermon.

13
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:30,280
 And I'm so excited that Anthony will be speaking to us next week without a TA, hopefully.

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,800
 That picture tells a million stories.

15
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,240
 It's a businessman, a businessman turned pastor.

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,520
 I came to Hong Kong as a businessman.

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,800
 I loved my job.

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,560
 I was general manager for the Hong Kong operation of AXA, one of the world's largest insurance

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,680
 companies.

20
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,480
 I was a businessman longer than I have been a pastor.

21
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,960
 Thirty three years, three months and three days.

22
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,880
 Well, not exactly, but it sounds good, doesn't it?

23
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,920
 And I'm often asked the question.

24
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,800
 How long have you been in full time ministry?

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,680
 And my answer.

26
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:38,520
 Is I have always been in full time ministry.

27
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:45,880
 The truth is, I reached more people for Christ.

28
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,880
 In the insurance industry, as the guy on the left of your screen.

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,760
 Then I do as a pastor.

30
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,560
 I spend far too much of my time now as a pastor with Christians.

31
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:11,200
 And I want to start off this evening by destroying the sort of myths that had me one day working

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,000
 for Mammon.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,600
 And the next day having a permanent halo on my head.

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
 Yeah, right.

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:35,960
 Church history has consistently been ready to put everything into two boxes.

36
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,520
 Sacred and sacred.

37
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,280
 Church was a building you went to.

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,720
 Communities were the things you did there.

39
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,880
 Clergy were the people who delivered them.

40
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,720
 For much of church history, they were male.

41
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,600
 And perhaps just a little bit boring.

42
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,320
 I just want to put it there.

43
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,480
 This has not been my experience.

44
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:20,120
 And as I reread the Bible, we have no authority to do so.

45
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:28,080
 In the early 80s, I was a successful sales manager of a UK insurance company, a subsidiary

46
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,840
 of a merchant bank.

47
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:39,760
 When in my late 20s, I realized I got practically everything the world could throw at me.

48
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:48,440
 But yet had a gaping chasm in my heart, a Christ-shaped hole, to be precise.

49
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:55,640
 I first saw this in other people who had clearly found something I didn't have and something

50
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,440
 I was looking for.

51
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:07,000
 So I recommitted my life, manifested in taking adult confirmation classes in my suburban

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,040
 Anglican church in the UK.

53
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:19,720
 But what happened was that the workplace became my mission field from day one.

54
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,720
 As everyone was curious what had happened to me.

55
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,040
 Although I was the company's leading sales manager, my lifestyle had become decidedly

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,720
 self-absorbed.

57
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:41,600
 To be honest, a foul-mouthed, driven workaholic.

58
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:51,560
 But now I had a new boss and was willing to follow him to the ends of the earth.

59
00:05:51,560 --> 00:06:01,920
 Literally, in 1987, I was asked to consider taking my family, my wife, Sandra, my two

60
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:10,960
 sons, Paul and Matt, even my sheepdog, Bella, to Hong Kong for three years to start an investment

61
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,120
 services company for National Mutual, our new parent company.

62
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,120
 Now our only previous visit to Hong Kong was in 1981.

63
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,960
 We were staying at the Regent Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui.

64
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,680
 We walked down Nathan Road and saw the people and my wife, Sandra, said, "You'll never get

65
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,520
 me to live here a million years."

66
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:46,320
 Now our arrival was actually coincident with the famous stock market crash of 1987.

67
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,040
 It was called Black Monday.

68
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:56,160
 I ended up with what I describe as trying to sell ice creams to Eskimos here.

69
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,900
 It was the toughest period of my whole business life.

70
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,600
 It was humbling.

71
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,880
 Now I wish I could tell you the whole story, but suffice to say, in that time, God gave

72
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:19,480
 me a vision for Hong Kong, a love for Hong Kong, and a vision for his church, and particular

73
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,360
 for evangelism.

74
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,160
 And 35 years later, I'm still here.

75
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:38,360
 And I can give testimony to 35 years of God's grace and him using this insurance man turned

76
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,480
 pastor to help build his kingdom here.

77
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:54,240
 I want to give credit here to the Union Church, who in 1995 allowed an insurance man with

78
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:05,240
 no pastoral experience to deliver live talks on their new course at the time.

79
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,240
 It was a course called Alpha.

80
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,360
 Alpha, something I am still doing by God's grace today.

81
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:29,600
 It was there that I first gained experience of delivering messages in church.

82
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:38,920
 My thinking on this topic has been heavily shaped by Ed Silvozo's book, Anointed for

83
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,440
 Jesus.

84
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:48,440
 Actually, I always secretly wanted to be a pastor.

85
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,840
 Now this book and the group of people that I gathered around me to study it, we were

86
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:02,000
 called FISH, F-I-S-H, Fellowship of Insurance Staff in Hong Kong.

87
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:13,240
 It told me that I already was a pastor, that all work was worship, and every Christian

88
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,720
 is a minister.

89
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,880
 I was in reality a marketplace pastor.

90
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:30,720
 I learned through this book and through this time that every business is God's business.

91
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,400
 The notion that labor for profit and worship of God are now and have always been God's

92
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,680
 a part is absolutely false.

93
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,160
 There is no sacred and secular divide.

94
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:59,480
 Look at this, the early church founders, mostly community leaders and highly successful business

95
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:09,320
 people, the writing of the Gospels was entrusted to Luke, a doctor, Matthew, a retired tax

96
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:17,800
 collector, Mark, the manager of a family trust, and John, a food supplier, FISH actually.

97
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:27,600
 In the book of Acts, Lydia was a dealer of purple cloth and Dorcas was a clothes designer.

98
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:35,680
 I want to share a quote from Ken Costa, who was actually a speaker at a church at KFC.

99
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,120
 He spoke one Saturday night.

100
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,720
 He said this, "God loves you.

101
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,400
 God loves the work he has called you to."

102
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,680
 Now I want to push this a bit further.

103
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:59,320
 Ed Silvozo talks about what he calls four lethal misbeliefs.

104
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,160
 What I want to do is I want to put my own slant on this.

105
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:12,080
 I've already hinted at this, that the first misbelief that there is a God-ordained division

106
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,500
 between clergy and laity.

107
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:23,480
 As part of my doctoral studies, I had the privilege to study theology of work under

108
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:30,760
 visiting professor Paul Stevens from the Regent Seminary in Vancouver.

109
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:39,640
 One of the things he said was this, "For Christians, the problem is that on one side of the line,

110
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:47,500
 there are Sunday things, I guess for us Saturday things, other worldly things, supernatural

111
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,060
 things, holy things, and spiritual things.

112
00:11:53,060 --> 00:12:03,140
 On the other side, there are unspiritual things, human things, natural things, this world things,

113
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,740
 and the things of everyday life."

114
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:16,820
 He said this, "This is the problem of dualism, that some things are sacred and some things

115
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
 are secular."

116
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:25,780
 He said this, "It is possibly the worst heresy in the Christian church worldwide."

117
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,500
 I mean, answer this question.

118
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,060
 In the 1950s, missionaries came to the South part of Korea.

119
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,500
 They did good work.

120
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:44,780
 At the end of the war, the percentage of people who are Christians in South Korea had risen

121
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,620
 from 2% to 30%.

122
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:54,860
 Today there are 20,000 plus churches there, including some of the world's biggest.

123
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,220
 I visited one of them.

124
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:02,140
 Won-yong Joido has 750,000 people attending.

125
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,220
 At the same time, an author by the name of J.R.R.

126
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:14,700
 Tolkien wrote the famous book, Lord of the Rings, and the children's story, The Hobbit.

127
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:22,500
 The question is, which one is sacred and which one is secular?

128
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:31,020
 Which work would the Lord have called worthier and more sacred than the others?

129
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:37,020
 Here we have the sacred, secular dualism.

130
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,260
 Church services are sacred.

131
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,380
 Company offices are not.

132
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:51,100
 Quiet times are sacred, but eating, sleeping, and resting are secular.

133
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:59,740
 Prayer meetings, of course, are sacred, but political action is secular.

134
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:12,700
 Reading the Bible or witnessing is sacred, but reading the newspaper is secular.

135
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:22,980
 The problem is the tragic separation of Sunday, or in this case, Saturday, and Monday to Friday.

136
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,180
 Church life is separated from ordinary life.

137
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,220
 State life is separated from public life.

138
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,100
 Inner life is separated from outer life.

139
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,780
 And belief is separated from behavior.

140
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:51,140
 The apostle Paul, in his writings, never said that people go to church to worship.

141
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:57,500
 Paul believed that we are worshipping God all the time.

142
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:05,380
 I don't think there is a part-time option for followers of Jesus.

143
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:13,260
 One thing people always ask me is, how was I able to make the transition between working

144
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,540
 for an insurance company and a church?

145
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:24,580
 And the truth is, I don't actually know how to answer it.

146
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:30,020
 You might call me naive, but to me, there was no difference.

147
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:38,380
 Both were primarily about people, and most importantly, both were about serving and glorifying

148
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
 God.

149
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,260
 I love this quote from famous inventor Thomas Edison.

150
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:52,860
 He said, "We often miss opportunity because it's dressed in overalls and looks like work."

151
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,540
 So let me move on to the second lethal belief.

152
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:04,460
 And it's this, that the church is called to operate primarily inside a building, often

153
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,100
 referred to as a temple.

154
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:17,460
 Now the old cliche, Christians don't go to church, they are the church, is arguably trite,

155
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,460
 but it's true.

156
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:24,140
 And we've just spent six weeks on a series talking about it.

157
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:30,620
 It's unoriginal, but it is far from unimportant.

158
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:37,940
 When people are not sleeping, most of their time is spent working.

159
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,940
 Think about it.

160
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:46,540
 The average Christian spends less than 2% of their waking time at church.

161
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:55,020
 Yet the church puts most of its energy and resources into that 2%, and very little into

162
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,060
 the world of daily work.

163
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:10,540
 I want to show you a Bible verse that we probably, all of us, read incorrectly.

164
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:16,420
 This is the NIV, Matthew 16, 18.

165
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:23,260
 And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the

166
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,860
 gates of Hades, or the gates of hell, will not overcome it.

167
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,860
 Now some background here.

168
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:36,020
 Jesus had asked his disciples who people were saying he was.

169
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:42,060
 And while with others waffling about John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, or one of the

170
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:48,380
 prophets, Simon Peter has a gift of faith and declares, "You are the Messiah, the Son

171
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,100
 of the living God."

172
00:17:51,100 --> 00:18:02,420
 Then Jesus says, "I will build my church."

173
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,220
 Or does he?

174
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,260
 Maybe he does in English.

175
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,820
 Maybe he does in the NIV.

176
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:19,500
 And every other translation, to be honest, I looked at more than 20 translations to see

177
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 this.

178
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,420
 But watch this.

179
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:34,500
 The Greek word, "ekklesia," means an assembly of people convened at the public place of

180
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,220
 counsel for the purpose of the liberating.

181
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,700
 I guess it's like a town hall today.

182
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,220
 It's a term that comes from the marketplace.

183
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,940
 Jesus did not say, "I will build my temple.

184
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,380
 I will build my synagogue."

185
00:18:53,380 --> 00:19:02,380
 There were specific Greek words for them, and Jesus chose not to use them.

186
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:11,580
 We have embraced and perpetuated a culture around this single word, a word that was never

187
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,580
 spoken by Jesus.

188
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,900
 Let me look at it another way.

189
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,020
 I started off by talking about Alpha.

190
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,340
 I've got a confession to make to you.

191
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:32,020
 I am a complete alphaholic.

192
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:41,180
 In his talk about "What About the Church," Nicky Gumbel describes five images and metaphors

193
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,780
 to describe the church.

194
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:52,220
 They are the people of God, the family of God, the body of Christ, a holy temple, the

195
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,540
 bride of Christ.

196
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:59,020
 Now, if you want to find out more, you'll need to come on the next KFCI Alpha in the

197
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
 autumn.

198
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:11,980
 But I can tell you that none of these refer to what we commonly call church.

199
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,940
 I want to look once again, without apology, at the passage we've been studying for the

200
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,180
 past two months.

201
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,620
 It's in Acts 2.

202
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:27,060
 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship and to the breaking of bread

203
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,820
 and to prayer.

204
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:34,420
 Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles.

205
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,900
 All the believers were together and had everything in common.

206
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,660
 They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.

207
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,140
 Every day, they continued to meet together in the temple courts.

208
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,740
 They broke bread in their homes.

209
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,780
 They ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all

210
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,780
 the people.

211
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:04,340
 And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

212
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,020
 Numbers were added daily.

213
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,740
 And where do we go daily?

214
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:17,780
 I guarantee it is not the first floor of the Far East Finance Center.

215
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:23,740
 My friends, the church has left the building.

216
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,140
 Ed Silvozo says this, "As long as we believe that the church was born within four walls,

217
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:36,320
 we will always need four walls to have a church."

218
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,460
 My third lethal misbelief is this.

219
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:47,780
 People involved in business cannot be as spiritual as those serving in traditional

220
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,900
 church ministry.

221
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:58,500
 One of my favorite all-time Christian books is The Call.

222
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,380
 It's written by a guy called Oz Guinness, whom I had the pleasure to meet on a number

223
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,460
 of occasions, most recently, about a year ago on Zoom.

224
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:15,300
 He says this, "No idea short of God's call can ground and fulfill the truest human desire

225
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,940
 for purpose and fulfillment."

226
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:29,900
 Now the Christian world often mistakes the word "call" from being called to what we all

227
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,300
 call full-time ministry.

228
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,460
 That is wrong.

229
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,940
 My friends, I need to tell you something.

230
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,220
 You are called.

231
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,500
 Let me say that again.

232
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,380
 You are called.

233
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:01,660
 Whether you're a preacher or people call you a super apostle or you're a bank manager,

234
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:10,780
 a school teacher or a full-time mom, whether you minister to drug addicts and street sleepers,

235
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:18,700
 or you wash dishes in a cha-chang tank, you are called.

236
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:27,500
 The fear of repeating myself, when people ask, "When was I called to the ministry?"

237
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:35,220
 I do not see my transfer from my office in AXA in Wanchai to my office in the Vine in

238
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,220
 Lankwai Fong.

239
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,820
 Yeah, yeah, we had our office in Lankwai Fong.

240
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:47,860
 A flash of lightning in the sky or a spiritual awakening, but rather a working out of a calling

241
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,540
 that was already there.

242
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,420
 I'll go further.

243
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:58,420
 We not only have a general calling, which is represented by the Great Commission, we

244
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,100
 each have a specific calling.

245
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:09,980
 Even when I became a pastor, God gave me a specific call to church unity and a specific

246
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:16,220
 call to raise up the next generation, which I hold to this day.

247
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,860
 Ken Costa again wrote this.

248
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:25,240
 The God who created and sustains the world is also the God of the workplace.

249
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:34,340
 If the Christian faith is not relevant in the workplace, it is not relevant at all.

250
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,900
 Now think about it.

251
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:44,340
 Jesus lived on the earth 33 years.

252
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:50,260
 Only three of them were in what we call ministry.

253
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:56,180
 He was the carpenter's son.

254
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,660
 He was born in the marketplace.

255
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:05,060
 It wasn't difficult for Jesus' neighbors to see him as a businessman, as many would have

256
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,340
 purchased his products.

257
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:16,660
 Most of Jesus' followers remain in full-time business while simultaneously conducting full-time

258
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,380
 ministry.

259
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:25,020
 This was possible because they saw the marketplace as their parish and their business as their

260
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,020
 pulpit.

261
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:33,740
 To them, witnessing was not an occasional activity, but a lifestyle.

262
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:40,260
 The book of Acts unfolds the story of believers who did more than tell people about Jesus

263
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,140
 in the marketplace.

264
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:47,700
 They witnessed a steady stream of signs and wonders.

265
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:57,700
 In fact, only one of the 40 extraordinary manifestations of God's power recorded in

266
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:04,220
 the book of Acts actually occurred in a religious venue, the healing of the lame man at the

267
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,460
 temple gate called Beautiful.

268
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:14,740
 Most of these spiritual wonders were facilitated by people such as Paul, Priscilla, and Aquila,

269
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:22,260
 who as ministry and business partners are classic examples of marketplace Christians.

270
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:30,540
 Today, millions of people, millions of men and women are similarly called to full-time

271
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:39,220
 ministry in business, education, and government, the marketplace.

272
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:46,900
 Unfortunately, many of these marketplace Christians feel like second-class citizens when compared

273
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,900
 to people who serve full-time in the church or in a ministry context.

274
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,500
 This should not be the case.

275
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:03,140
 It is imperative that they realize that it's not only okay to do ministry in the marketplace,

276
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:09,940
 but that God has explicitly called them and anointed them for it.

277
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:16,620
 By anointed, I mean they have been chosen and empowered by the Holy Spirit for a divinely

278
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,280
 sanctioned assignment.

279
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,740
 By ministry, I mean they can do more than just witness.

280
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:29,380
 They can bring transformation to their jobs and then to their cities as happened in the

281
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,660
 first century.

282
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:40,140
 Most marketplace Christians already know that their ministry and their occupation are somehow

283
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:48,020
 connected, but they do not comprehend exactly how.

284
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:54,060
 American author Jean E. Veith says this, "The priesthood of all believers did not make everybody

285
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,060
 into church workers.

286
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:04,260
 Rather, it turned every kind of work into a sacred calling."

287
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,380
 My friends, put that on your fridge.

288
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:12,660
 I guess we all grew up thinking that the primary, sorry, I want to give you the fourth misconception

289
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,660
 first.

290
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:19,380
 The fourth misconception is the primary role of marketplace Christians is to make money

291
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:25,700
 to support the vision of those in the ministry.

292
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,700
 So let's go back one.

293
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:34,340
 I guess we all grew up thinking that the primary purpose of business people in the church was

294
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,740
 to earn the money to pay their tithes so that the pastor could do the ministry stuff.

295
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,420
 In particular, the Sunday church service and the sermon.

296
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,260
 One prays, the other pays, right?

297
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:55,500
 I want to use this last section to encourage the church to take seriously its role of equipping

298
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
 the marketplace.

299
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:05,100
 It is, I believe, the key to the transformation of our city, the transformation of Hong Kong,

300
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:11,660
 and the events of the last two to three years have, I believe, prepared our hearts and churches

301
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,660
 for this.

302
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:17,220
 I remember a Hong Kong Sunday school teacher saying this to me.

303
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:25,660
 I spend 45 minutes a week teaching Sunday school, and they call me up to the front of

304
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,100
 the church and they pray for me.

305
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:40,580
 The rest of the week, I'm a full-time teacher, and the church has never prayed for me.

306
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,860
 My friends, that breaks my heart.

307
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:55,260
 Church, we desperately need a rethink.

308
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:02,340
 Green churches are churches that have a vision of God at work where their people work, that

309
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:09,580
 connect daily work to worship, that address the opportunities and challenges that people

310
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:16,460
 face at work, that invest resources in equipping people for their work, that create structures

311
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:23,040
 to sustain workplace ministry, release and support their people for work outside the

312
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:31,820
 church building, and they encourage everyone to take responsibility.

313
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:38,500
 I want to share with you a story that only came to me this week, but it's such an encouragement

314
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:44,580
 to me as I prepared to pray this.

315
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,380
 This lady is called Andrea.

316
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:58,540
 Andrea, I used to work at the same company with 35 years ago.

317
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,180
 I haven't seen her since.

318
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,300
 In fact, actually, as I told you, I was in the sales office.

319
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,220
 She was an executive secretary.

320
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,860
 I didn't know her very well.

321
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,660
 We were connected through Facebook, I think mainly because her and her husband actually

322
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,100
 moved to Spain and we moved to Hong Kong.

323
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:23,900
 She wrote to me this week, "Hi, John, just a quick message to ask if you could include

324
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,860
 me in your prayers.

325
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:34,820
 I have terminal cancer and I have been told I haven't much time left.

326
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,660
 A prayer for me would be such a comfort.

327
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,900
 Bless you."

328
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,620
 Somebody I haven't seen for 35 years.

329
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,900
 Of course, I got straight back to her and said, "I need to pray some bold prayers, but

330
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:58,100
 I need to be bold with you that this life is not all that it's about."

331
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:05,540
 I shared about Jesus and in coming to die for us and the gift of eternal life.

332
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,300
 As suggested, she prayed this prayer, it was a sinner's prayer.

333
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,860
 She wrote back to me a few hours later to say, "I've prayed that prayer.

334
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,100
 I feel so much better now."

335
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,620
 Then we prayed for her to receive the Holy Spirit as well.

336
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,100
 She said this, "Bless you, John.

337
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:33,140
 Your kindness has made me quite emotional, but I know I will be going to a wonderful

338
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:37,220
 place and talking to you each day."

339
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,060
 I promised to contact her every day.

340
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:44,580
 "It will make me stronger.

341
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:52,700
 Please none of you underestimate what you might do in your workplace or the people you

342
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,300
 contact.

343
00:32:54,300 --> 00:33:01,100
 The mom at the school gate, the person you see on the bus, the person at lunchtime.

344
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:09,660
 Thirty-five years after I last worked at the same company of this lady, she this week has

345
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:18,780
 received Jesus as her Lord and Savior and knows that she has an eternal destiny."

346
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:26,460
 Would you take just one minute now, just in silence, to pray for Andrea?

347
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,180
 I told her tonight that our church was going to be praying for her.

348
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,140
 So pray in whatever way you like.

349
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:41,700
 We're going to pray for Andrea, who is in a hospice in Watford in the UK, suffering

350
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,180
 from what the doctors have said is terminal cancer.

351
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:53,020
 Let's pray.

352
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,980
 I always finish my sermons with a challenge.

353
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:05,940
 I want to finish today with a challenge for every one of you to be part of what I call

354
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
 a new breed.

355
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:12,940
 Now, what do I mean by that?

356
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:23,460
 On the 28th of February 2006 at the Vine Centre in Central, Sandra and I received a prophecy

357
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:30,820
 from a preacher called Dr. Kingsley Fletcher that will shape our future ministry.

358
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,700
 Part of it, I won't give it all to you.

359
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:38,500
 He said that John and Sandra are part of a new breed that God is raising up around the

360
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
 world.

361
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,500
 Let go so that he becomes God.

362
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,060
 God will be teaching you things that some things God will ask you to do that you won't

363
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:52,060
 find in any textbook or anyone else doing.

364
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,320
 This is not strange.

365
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,840
 God will use your uniqueness and will make you to be stronger.

366
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:05,660
 You will chase lasting impact in his kingdom.

367
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,300
 Two months later, I was in New York City.

368
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,380
 I woke early on the 21st of April.

369
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,260
 I was still jet lagged.

370
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,740
 And I sense God say this to me for the church in the marketplace.

371
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,060
 Please test it.

372
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:26,540
 I say to you, church of the 21st century arise for you are a new breed.

373
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,500
 Have I not said, behold, I'm doing a new thing.

374
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,460
 Have I not said, do not dwell on the past.

375
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,020
 Now is the time to take me for my word.

376
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:41,180
 It will be manifested in you and will be a light for the whole world to see.

377
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,500
 Business people, you are a new breed.

378
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,220
 I will teach you things you did not learn at business school.

379
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:54,020
 Your anointing, your new anointing has nothing to do with your ability, but has everything

380
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,020
 to do with your availability.

381
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,920
 Remember I am the Potter.

382
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,480
 You are the clay.

383
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,060
 You have nothing to fear from the potter's kiln.

384
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,100
 I am the expert craftsman and will mold you into the unique design I have for you.

385
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,620
 I will give you a new heart and a new love for my church.

386
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:16,140
 I will give you a supernatural love for your pastors and church leaders.

387
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,700
 Do not try and mold your church leaders into the things you are expecting them to be.

388
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,780
 Allow me to do this.

389
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:29,060
 They will not be persuaded by words, by formula or by clever persuasion, by the love that

390
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,860
 you show them.

391
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:36,220
 As you show them my love, they will gradually link arms with you and you will be able to

392
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:44,660
 approach the commission I have given you in the way that I have intended, hand in hand.

393
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:50,100
 People will be attracted to this by the love you have for one another.

394
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,860
 I will use this to change the world.

395
00:36:53,860 --> 00:37:01,340
 This new breed will become world changers, but only to the extent that they have received

396
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:06,340
 and given manifested my love.

397
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:11,080
 The new breed does not construct walls.

398
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,940
 It tears them down.

399
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,140
 The new breed does not fight for territory.

400
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,620
 It opens its borders.

401
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:30,700
 The new breed has no agenda except for that one who has ordained this new season.

402
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:40,540
 I say to you, arise, men and women of God, your time has come.

403
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:50,500
 My friends, will you join me and be part of this new breed?

404
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,780
 I'd like you just to close your eyes now.

405
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,100
 I want to give you a blessing.

406
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:06,620
 If you feel comfortable wherever you are, just hold your hands out in front of you.

407
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:14,940
 The blessing is this, may the love of God sustain us in our working.

408
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,500
 May the light of Jesus radiate our thinking and speaking.

409
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:26,980
 May the power of the spirit penetrate all our deliberating.

410
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:37,420
 And may all that is done witness to your presence in our lives.

411
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,020
 Amen.

412
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:48,020
