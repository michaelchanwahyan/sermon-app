[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   Good evening.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.560]   Well thank you Pastor John for that lovely skit.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.560]   Who enjoyed it?
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.560]   Raise your hands.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.560]   Yeah?
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.560]   You enjoyed it?
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.560]   Yeah?
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.560]   Very good.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.560]   All right, my hat just dropped.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.560]   It's okay.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.560]   All good.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.960]   We are doing a character study.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.480]   We're doing a character study.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.880]   And last week we talked about this girl named Mary.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.200]   There's something about Mary.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.720]   And Pastor John reminded us last week that the story of Christmas is about somebody who
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.000]   became nobody so that somebodies can be somebodies.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:55.240]   And Jesus came so that Mary could be a symbol, a symbol and a servant for the Lord.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.000]   And Pastor John last week talked about the calling of Mary.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.280]   This innocent girl, teenage girl in her innocence, yet God chose her and she stood in faith to
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.400]   receive this calling from the Lord.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.680]   Today we are going to talk about Joseph.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.920]   Joseph, the father of Jesus.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.440]   And what do we know about Joseph?
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.880]   What was his occupation?
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.880]   What did he do?
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.280]   Was he the CEO of IBM?
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.280]   Google?
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.280]   No?
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.240]   Was he like a football coach?
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.240]   No.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.000]   He was a carpenter.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.480]   Who does carpentry here?
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.480]   Anybody do company?
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.840]   Oh, what do you make?
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.160]   Uncle Vincent.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.160]   Anything?
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.160]   Wow.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.040]   Can you make a house?
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.880]   Can you make a manger?
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.880]   Okay.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.560]   All right.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.600]   Very good.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.840]   And so what we know about Joseph is that he was a carpenter.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.240]   And what we know is that he likely died early because he wasn't there as Jesus begun his
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.840]   ministry.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.840]   He wasn't there.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.680]   He was only Mary at the resurrection, at the death and the resurrection was only Mary,
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.200]   the mother of Mary.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.840]   And so Bonnie did an amazing job reading for us about the birth of Jesus.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.200]   Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.880]   to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.320]   Now imagine, right, you're going to marry somebody for those who've been married and
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:48.520]   you find out that this girl is pregnant and it must have been shocking for Joseph, right?
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.560]   Imagine you're a fiance, you're about to get married and she's pregnant and you haven't
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.200]   done anything with her, right?
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.520]   It must have been shocking.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.600]   How do you think Joseph would have felt?
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   How do you think?
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   Shocked?
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   Betrayed?
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   Maybe angry?
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   Mad?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   How could this happen?
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   I would feel so betrayed.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   And so this was Mary's situation, that she was pregnant before she was married.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   And so there would have been all sorts of social dilemmas, social circumstances happening
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   because of this, right?
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   What would have the parents would have thought, right?
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   What would have Joseph's parents would have thought?
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   What would have the parents of Mary thought?
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   What would have Joseph's parents would have thought?
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   What would have her friends and family would have thought?
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   Like, how could this happen?
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   Mary, we thought you were a good girl, right?
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   What happened, Mary?
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   What were you thinking, Mary?
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   Right?
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   And so this was Mary's situation.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   And so Joseph's dilemma would have been this.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   How could I marry a girl that's already pregnant?
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   How would it make him look?
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   Like he did something with her before they got married, that they would be unclean, right?
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.600]   Joseph's laughing.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   He assumed that the child was somebody else's, right?
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   Like, Mary, who you been?
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.600]   Who are you with?
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   You know, the last couple of days or the last couple of weeks or the last couple of months, right?
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   He would have been questioning these things.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   And so this would have been happening in Joseph's mind.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   And so the first thing we see about Joseph, that it says in the Bible that he chose, he was going to divorce her privately.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   Okay?
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   So that meant maybe not get married with her or get married and quickly divorce her.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   Joseph could have brought shame to Mary, right?
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   Women who are unclean or have, or are pregnant before married, getting married, you know,
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   there's certain connotations associated with these women.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   But Joseph chose not to bring public disgrace to her.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   He wanted this to go quietly.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:25.600]   And so it shows that Joseph had some sort of kindness, sensitivity, consideration towards Mary.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   He hadn't done anything wrong, right?
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.600]   He knew that, right?
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   He knew he was innocent.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   Mary, he wasn't sure about.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.600]   And he could have assumed different things.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   But he chose to divorce her quietly.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   His thinking was to divorce her quietly.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.600]   Next, we read about Joseph's dream.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   Who had a dream last night?
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   Anybody have a dream last night?
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   Yeah?
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.600]   Did you dream about Joseph?
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   (laughing)
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.600]   I had a dream, but I don't remember.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.600]   Do you guys remember your dream?
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   Anybody remember your dream?
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   It's really hard to remember your dream, right?
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   Unless you think about it right away, and you start like thinking about it,
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   then you might remember it.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   I feel like that's how you remember it.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   But anyways, Joseph remembered his dream.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   And what did he dream about?
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   Well, an angel spoke to him, right?
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.600]   Let's read it once together.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   One, two, three.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife,
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.600]   because he will save his people from their sins."
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   Joseph did remember this dream, and he remembered it clearly.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   So clearly that Matthew, the writer, wrote it down.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.600]   And you see in this next picture, it's a painting of Joseph sleeping,
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   and the angel in his dream, as you see in the next photo.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   You see it yet? No? Okay. Next photo. Yeah. There you go. That's the dream.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   And so what do you think Joseph's options are at this point after the dream?
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   Well, the first option would be to listen to the angel, right?
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   Okay, I just woke up. I had this dream.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   It must be true. I feel like it must be true.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   An angel spoke directly about this issue.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   Who's had a problem in their life, and they've dreamt about it?
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   Have they dreamt and then dreamt solutions about this?
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.600]   Who's had an issue, and this issue was so stuck in their mind
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   that they started to dream about it?
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   Hanani did. Anybody else? Yeah? You've dreamt about it, right?
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.600]   Sometimes you keep thinking about things before bed,
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   and you dream about it afterwards. It happens.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   So maybe Joseph could have questioned his dream.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.600]   Did I really dream, or was I dreaming about a problem
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.600]   that I was thinking about before I slept?
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   So he could have continued with the divorce,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   be like, "You know, this dream is probably not something I should believe in."
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.600]   But he chose to believe in this dream,
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.600]   and he chose to believe in the angel.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:34.600]   And so it shows that Joseph is a God-fearing man,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   a God-fearing father.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   He chose to follow the angel's instructions.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   Now, it would have been easier to divorce her quietly, right?
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   Like, "This woman was pregnant before I got married."
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   There's all sort of social connotations that come with that.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.600]   And to divorce her quietly, I did nothing wrong.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.600]   It would have been the easier way out.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.600]   But to marry some, to marry Mary,
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   and to have her pregnant already, he would have had to do some explaining,
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   just like Pastor John had to explain to his mother, right, on the cell phone.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.600]   And so there, it would have been harder, actually, I believe.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   It would have been harder to have to explain to your friends,
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   to your family what has happened,
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.600]   and to convince them that, "No, I've not been drinking.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   I have not been smoking," whatever.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   Pastor John said he was smoking.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   But that he was actually chosen.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:43.600]   He and Mary were chosen by the Lord to parent the Messiah,
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.600]   to be the father of Jesus.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.600]   So we see that Joseph is kind-hearted, considerate.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   We see that Joseph is God-fearing.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:01.600]   The last thing we see about Joseph is that he was a father,
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   a protecting father.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.600]   Let's read together one more time.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   One, two, three.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.600]   "After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   to Joseph in Egypt and said,
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   'Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel,
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.600]   for those who are trying to take the child's life are dead.'"
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.600]   Who was trying to take the child's life?
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   Herod.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.600]   And Herod was the king at that time that the Romans had put forth.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   Now, King Herod, he was shaking in his boots, right,
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.600]   because there were prophecies that a king was born.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   And what did he have his soldiers do?
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:51.600]   He had all the soldiers go and kill the children in Bethlehem.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   That's unheard of.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.600]   That's genocide.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.600]   And this is a painting, right, of a mother.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   Imagine being a mother and you have a child under the age of two or three,
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   and you're trying to hide that child,
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.600]   because soldiers are coming for that child,
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   to kill that child on the order of Herod,
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.600]   who is so afraid of this coming king,
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   because he wants to keep his authority.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   Joseph is a protecting father.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:30.600]   He chose to take Jesus to Egypt to hide the child.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.600]   And so we see three things from Joseph.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.600]   The first thing is that he is kind, considerate.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   Of the situation he was in,
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   with Mary being pregnant before they were going to get married.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   He is God-fearing.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   He chose to listen to the angel.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.600]   He is a protecting father.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   A protecting father.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   And Joseph is a symbol of a great father.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.600]   And when I think of fathers, I think of Pastor John.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   You know, he's a great spiritual father to some of us.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.600]   Who thinks he's a spiritual father to you? Raise your hand.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.600]   Yeah, he's a spiritual father.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.600]   Yeah, he's a spiritual father to me.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   Hi, Pastor John.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.600]   And I've seen him many times go out of his way to help somebody.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   Right? Somebody in need, he would go out of his way
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.600]   just to care for that person, just to call that person,
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.600]   to give to that person,
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.600]   to be a father's heart, to give a father's heart,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   a hug to that person.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:46.600]   Pastor John is a great example of a spiritual father to us.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.600]   Some people, you know, can be (speaks in foreign language)
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   Right? He says that.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.600]   Some people can be (speaks in foreign language)
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:57.600]   But he goes out of his way to help them, pray for them,
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.600]   be considerate, kind towards them.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.600]   And when I think about a God-fearing father,
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   I actually think of my own father.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   You see the next picture, my own father.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   And I shared this story.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   You've seen this picture before, no?
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   Okay, all right.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   I think of my father as a God-fearing father.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   I've shared this story before.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   He studied in a Christian school, middle school or high school
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.600]   in Hong Kong.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   And his idol was, do you guys remember who his idol was?
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.600]   A Kung Fu master named Bruce Lee, right?
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600]   Wah!
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.600]   Right? Yellow suit.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:53.600]   And he learned that Bruce Lee had, suddenly had cancer.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   Right? He had cancer, yeah?
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.600]   No, he didn't have cancer.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   Sorry, what happened to him?
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.600]   He died, sorry.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   He didn't have cancer.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   I was testing you.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   I was testing you.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.600]   You see?
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   He didn't have cancer.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.600]   He just died suddenly, okay?
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.600]   Maybe too many raw eggs or something, or something, I don't know.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.600]   Too much pressure from Hollywood.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   I don't know.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   It's a conspiracy.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.600]   Uncle Vincent's on that conspiracy.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   You can talk to him about it afterwards.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.600]   And at the same time, he learned Bruce Lee died.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.600]   He had some sort of tumor on his wrist.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.600]   And so he was so afraid of death, right?
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   And so at that time, he was studying Christian studies,
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.600]   and he was getting top marks, and Christians in that class were telling him
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   to believe in God.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.600]   And he's like, "No, I don't need to believe in God.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   I have higher Christian marks than you in religious class."
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   But that incident of Bruce Lee dying and him possibly having cancer
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:01.600]   shocked him to his core, and he chose to put his faith in Jesus.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   And he received a calling from Jesus to go into seminary.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.600]   And you know how Asian parents are, right?
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.600]   My grandmother, what should he study?
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.600]   He should be a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer, right?
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:23.600]   But he told his parents, my grandparents, that he was going to go to seminary.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.600]   And how do you think my grandparents reacted?
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   Not happy, right?
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   My grandmother was crying, like, "What are you doing?
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.600]   Don't go."
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   My dad was threatening to kick him out of the house,
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   but he chose to fear the Lord even more than he chose to fear his parents,
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:49.600]   kicking him out of the house, an example of a God-fearing father.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   And I actually chose myself as an example of a protecting father.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   I don't know why, but back in 2016, when I played basketball,
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.600]   there would be a fight a week.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.600]   It doesn't really happen that much anymore.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.600]   But back in 2016, when I did my internship here,
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   there would be a fight a week.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.600]   These older basketball players picked on younger players, right?
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.600]   And they were so sensitive about fouls or whatnot.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.600]   And many times, I would even go over to another court.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.600]   I was playing basketball in one court, and I saw a fight emerging.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.600]   I would just walk over and just stop them, right?
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.600]   I would put out two hands like Iron Man and just, like, stop them, right?
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   Like this, right?
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.600]   Like there was a civil war, and I would just stop them, right?
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   And then I would tell the younger kid, usually, just, "Oh, just walk away.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   They're a little bit, you know, crazy.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   Just walk away."
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.600]   And that would be that.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.600]   I would actually take the protecting father role.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   And my friends would be like, "Whoa, what were you doing?
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.600]   You just got up and stopped that fight?"
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.600]   And I'm like, "Yeah, why didn't you help?"
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   They were just, you know, sitting there, drinking water and resting.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   And so there's so many good examples of fathers in our life.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.600]   It could be Pastor John.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.600]   It could be my own father.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   It could be me in the basketball court.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:29.600]   But the ultimate example of a heavenly father, an ultimate example of an
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.600]   amazing father is our heavenly father.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:41.600]   You know, me, Pastor John, my dad, Joseph, we are just a glimpse of how amazing
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.600]   our heavenly father is.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:50.600]   As kind and considerate as Pastor John is and has as big of a heart as he has to
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:18:01.600]   love us and to be our spiritual father, our heavenly father is a thousand times more.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:08.600]   As God-fearing as my dad is, you know, our heavenly father, Jesus, is an example
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   a thousand times more.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   As protecting as I am of some of the kids and teens on the basketball court,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:25.600]   Jesus is a hundred--our heavenly father is a thousand times more protecting of you.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:33.600]   And that's what I want us to understand today, that we have an amazing father.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.600]   I don't know how your biological father is and how your relationship with him is
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:47.600]   in your life, but I'm here to tell you that you have an amazing heavenly father
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   who is perfect in love and in kindness.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.600]   He knows your heart.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.600]   He knows the struggles that you're going through.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   He knows the things that are on your mind that are weighing you down.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.600]   And he is a protecting father.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.600]   He wants to protect you.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:17.600]   If you step into obedience, if you come into his arms, he is there for you.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.600]   And he wants to bless you.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:27.600]   And the blessing might not come in this life on earth, but the blessing may come
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   eventually in eternity in heaven where there is going to be a perfect,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.600]   perfect life with him in eternity.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.600]   There's this song as the band comes up.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.600]   I want to remind you of the song.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.600]   It says this.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.600]   Let's read it together, actually.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.600]   One, two, three.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.600]   I run to the father.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   I fall into grace.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.600]   I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   My heart needs a surgeon.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.600]   My soul needs a friend.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   So I run to the father again and again.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:11.600]   Are you in need of a father's love, a father's heart?
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:18.600]   Are you in need of a father's protection, a father's kindness?
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.600]   Would you consider running to the father?
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   Joseph was an amazing father.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.600]   Pastor John is an amazing father.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:31.600]   My dad is an amazing father.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:38.600]   But the best father of all is our heavenly father.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.600]   Would you run to him?
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:49.600]   Would you fall into his grace, fall into his arms?
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.600]   Would you bring him your struggles?
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.600]   Would you bring him your pain?
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   Would you soak in his love?
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:06.600]   That is the father that is speaking to you tonight,
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:13.600]   that loves you, that wants to hold you,
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   that understands you.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.600]   Let's take a moment and just embrace our father's arms,
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.600]   heavenly father.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   [music]
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:59.600]   Heavenly father, we thank you for the story of Joseph
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   and how an amazing father he was to Jesus.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   We thank you that it points us towards you,
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:19.600]   a kind, loving, protecting father who welcomes us into your arms.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.600]   We thank you for Christmas, that ultimately you sent Jesus
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   to protect us from sin, to save us from sin.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.600]   We thank you for Christmas that you sent Jesus
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   out of your love and kindness for us.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:44.600]   We thank you that you call us to obedience, to God-fearing,
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   so that we may be blessed by you,
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:52.600]   whether in this life or in eternity.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.600]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.600]   And the church said, "Amen."
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.600]   Let us rise and respond in this song.
