[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.240]   Good evening everyone. Long weekend and it is warm, it is nice. I was actually on a boat
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.520]   earlier today so actually I was sitting there like, "Whoa, how is the hall moving?" Hey,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.800]   but it's really good to see you all. If you have joined us for the first time, I welcome
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.980]   you. We've been going through the series on the Book of Timothy, the pastoral letter written
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.480]   by Paul to Timothy. And the first week we were talking about him charging Timothy with
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.920]   lots of things. Michelle talked about Paul charging Timothy to uphold truth. And then
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.240]   the next week was Johnny talking about charging him to pray, to pray for leaders, to pray
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.320]   for all kings, people in charge. Because leading is hard. Those of us who are in leadership
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.640]   positions in any kind of capacity, you will know that it is hard. Having to make decisions,
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.800]   having to take responsibility, having to be considerate to others, having to remain humble
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.760]   whilst you are in charge, all these things are really present to us, a really big challenge.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.880]   And at the beginning of this series, I presented to us the question, "Where is the love? What
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.920]   would love have me do?" The whole point of the command, the goal of the command, the
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.440]   aim of the charge is love, the issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.360]   faith. And as we're talking about that, as we're thinking about, "Okay, so where is the
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.880]   love?" Really, and where is the church in regards to this? The next real question that
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.000]   we are going to ask today is, "Where are the leaders? Where are the leaders who are going
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.680]   to be showing us how to love? Where are the leaders who are going to be showing us how
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.440]   to conduct ourselves?" And we're talking about this issue of leadership. And this has been
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.100]   on my heart a lot these last few years, particularly these last few years, because we have seen
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.360]   all kinds of leaders in all parts of the world, leading in all kinds of ways, right? We have
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.540]   all these leaders who are doing it in their own ways, and we're all arguing about which
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.700]   leaders are right, which leaders are wrong. And here we are, presented with this question
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.680]   that we should turn back to ourselves. Where is the church in regards to this? Is the church
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:21.120]   becoming a leader in society? Is the church setting an example about how we ought to behave,
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.360]   which is what Paul just said to Timothy? Thank you, Tiffany, for reading that out as well.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.480]   So today we're going to look at this issue of leadership, and we're going to turn to
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.940]   1 Timothy 3 that Tiffany read. And you know what? This whole passage is basically a job
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.040]   description. It's a job description of what a leader should be. And those of you who are
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.920]   leaders, maybe you're looking at it going, "Hmm, do I measure up to this list?" This
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.280]   is a tough list. This is a high calling. This is a high bar for what a leader should be.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.200]   And if you're a leader, this should send you at least into some level of anxiety or at
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.080]   least questioning yourself is, "Am I these things? Am I addicted to too much wine? Am
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.820]   I truly, truly the leader that God is asking me to be?" Now, this kind of job description
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.720]   is very different to what the world shows. We're in a season now where I'm talking to
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.520]   a lot of young people who are applying to university. And what do you do when you apply
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.960]   to university? You tell this university all the things that you have done or all the things
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.420]   that you are associated with, even if it's not fully accurate. And when you're applying
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.480]   for a job, you are telling them all the things, all the teams that you have been on, that
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.880]   you don't specify that you weren't doing much in those teams, but at least that you were
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.640]   in those teams doing those things. It's all about what you've done. All about what you've
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.760]   done. And maybe in this city, it's all about what you know. But what we see here is God
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.240]   is here doing a job description. And it's not really about what you've done. It's about
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.800]   who you are. It's not about what you ought to do. It's about who you ought to be. And
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.520]   so we see something that's very different as we look at when God is hiring for a leader.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.400]   When God is looking for a leader, he is asking for very different things to the things that
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.440]   we're asking for. I follow this Instagram account by this pastor called Honest Youth
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.320]   Pastor and he has some really interesting things that he says. And he says this one
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.200]   thing that actually has stuck into my mind. It's been engraved in my mind. And he says,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.120]   you know what? Churches assign and appoint leaders without looking at 1 Timothy 3 and
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   then wonder why their churches are falling apart. Churches appoint leaders without looking
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.240]   at 1 Timothy 3 and then wonder afterwards why their churches are falling apart. God
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.280]   has made it so clear what kind of leaders that we're looking for, yet do we often look
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.920]   at this leader? And you know what? Scripture says that leaders will be measured by a different
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.960]   stick. And that terrifies me, but that also keeps me in line. And as I look at this passage
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.040]   here and we're going to look at this, is let's reflect on what it means for us right now.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.040]   For those of us who are leaders and for those of us who are hoping to be or aspiring to
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.080]   be leaders. And we see that it's not about what we do, but it's about character. God
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.760]   cares more about what is inside rather than just on the outside. So actually there's no
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.000]   really clever way to separate it. I'm just going to go through verse by verse actually.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.040]   So as we look at this, before I jump into it, I guess a little bit of context here.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.360]   Ephesus, which I said last time, it was this vibrant city with all these people. It was
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.640]   booming in terms of its economy, all the trade going on in there. And the church was starting
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.240]   to grow, growing in all these little house churches. But the problem was as people were
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.720]   coming in to the church, they were starting to argue. People from all walks of life with
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.840]   all kinds of preferences, with all kinds of experience and status were coming in and demanding
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.320]   to be heard. And then that's the context that we're in right now. But Paul is writing to
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.700]   Timothy, this young pastor saying, "Hey, look, you need to establish and appoint a leadership
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.360]   in your church that has this criteria because otherwise they will continue to be quarrelling.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.800]   They will continue to be fighting. There will continue to be heresy and domineering." And
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.080]   that is not what we want. The church is in its early state and it needs to start off
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.500]   in the right way. So he starts and he says this in verse one, "The saying is trustworthy.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.760]   If anyone aspires to be the office of an overseer, he desires a noble task." He starts off with
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.560]   this. He says, "The saying is trustworthy." Why does he say that? Again, context. We said
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.760]   the first chapter was about upholding truth because there was all this rubbish, all this
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.760]   meaningless arguing about genealogies and all these other things and all these myths.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.600]   And he said, "Hey, look, if you want something true, if you want to hold on to something,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.240]   if you want to take this to the bank, take this to the bank. Those who aspire to be leaders."
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.680]   The word overseer here, it can be translated as elder, pastor, or shepherd. Someone who
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.600]   looks after a group of people. That's what overseer is, is providing spiritual oversight,
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:49.560]   is providing teaching. And he says, "This is a trustworthy saying. This is true. This
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:56.640]   is fact. Anyone who aspires for that kind of role, desires a what? A noble task. Not
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.360]   a self-serving one. Not just to climb up the ladder. Not just to get another badge on your
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:09.340]   arm. But this is a noble one. This is a selfless one." And actually, everyone should aspire
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:16.680]   to that kind of level, to have that kind of heart to lead people to serve them. So that's
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.280]   where we go into and he says, "He desires a noble task." Verse two, "Therefore, an overseer,
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:29.720]   an elder/shepherd/pastor, must be one above reproach." You can't find obvious faults with
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.440]   this person. You can't see obvious sins in their life. That's not to say there isn't
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:41.440]   underneath, but at the very beginning, you can't see these things. They have to be above
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.040]   reproach. And then the second one is this. Some of them I'll go through a little bit
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.240]   more and some of them, because it will be easy to understand, you have to be the husband
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.360]   of one wife. The husband of one wife. Now, this isn't targeting being against single
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.600]   people and saying, "Hey, if you're not married with one wife, you can't do this." This is
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:08.040]   more addressing the issue of having someone who is in a committed and faithful relationship.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:14.300]   Just one wife. Just committed and faithful to one. You see, I stop there and sometimes
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.760]   I read through this and it's so fast and of course, it's the right thing. You shouldn't
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.440]   cheat and leaders in the church definitely shouldn't cheat. I just skim over it, but
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:28.680]   then I stop and I'm like, "You know what? We're now in a stage in the church, in society,
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:35.360]   where the fact that that has to be said is still very, very important because we're in
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.700]   a place where church leaders are falling one by one to this same problem. And so, we need
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.640]   to take this very seriously, that actually this leader needs to be committed and needs
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:54.000]   to be faithful, doesn't fall in to the same temptations and desires of the flesh. Husband
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   of one wife. He has to be sober-minded. Sober-minded. This is different to just someone who is not
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.800]   addicted to too much wine. When someone is sober-minded, they are vigilant and they are
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.140]   aware and they are even keeled. And I'll tell you why the leaders of those days needed to
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:17.040]   be sober-minded because at that point, the church was again in a very vulnerable state.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.940]   It was just about to take off. It was just about to grow, but it was still facing persecution.
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.380]   It was facing all this heresy that was coming in. Every day, you'd probably get new news
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.560]   about someone being chased down, someone being targeted. So, what you needed was a leader
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.260]   who wouldn't panic. Not a leader that would be too anxious. Not a leader that would react
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.940]   to any kind of news that they would hear. Someone who was even keeled, sober-minded,
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:44.020]   vigilant and aware of all the challenges that the church would face. We need leaders who
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.980]   are sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable. Hospitable is an interesting
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:55.000]   one. Hospitable was very, very important. Well, it is important now, but it was super
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.540]   important back then. Why? Because the churches were in the homes. Can you imagine if this
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:06.180]   leader wasn't hospitable, who didn't want people to step into their home? Have a think
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:12.180]   a little bit now. When you last walked into someone's home, and that person was very hospitable,
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.300]   what did they do for you? When you walk in, they probably, well, if it's a Chinese household,
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.940]   they probably kind of passive-aggressively tell you to take your shoes off by giving
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.300]   you some flip-flops to wear. And then you come in, and, "Oh, I'd leave your bags over
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:34.780]   here. I'll put your mask here and maybe spray you." And then, what do they do? And they'll
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.660]   be like, "Oh, would you like something to drink? Oh, would you like something to eat?
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.900]   Oh, take a seat here. Take a seat here. Oh, don't sit there. Sit here. Sit where it's
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.740]   comfortable." You see, someone who is hospitable, what does that really mean? That means someone
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:53.620]   who is willing to put the interests of others first. It's considering others more significant
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.260]   than yourself. This is Philippians 2. This is, if you're going to be a leader, you have
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:02.300]   to be considerate. You have to be caring. And it was especially important in the church
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:08.700]   in those days because that's where the church grew, within the home. So you needed a home,
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.060]   and you needed a leader who was hospitable. And we'll talk a little bit more about that
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:18.500]   later as well. And it carries on, "And able to teach." The next one's a pretty self-explanatory.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:26.100]   Not a drunkard, not violent, but gentle. Not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. Again,
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.140]   here it goes into the negative now and saying, "You can't be drunk. You can't be violent."
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:35.140]   But you have to be gentle. Not to say that you have to be soft. Gentle doesn't mean soft,
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:39.460]   right? Gentle means that you have a strength that you are restraining, that you are holding
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:44.940]   back. That's what gentle means. Gentle doesn't mean weak and soft. So you have to be all
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.940]   those things. This is a tough list if we go through. And verse 4, it says this, "He must
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:56.660]   manage his own household well, with all dignity, keeping his children submissive. For if someone
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:04.980]   does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church?" Here,
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.300]   Paul steps it up a notch. He's talking about, "Hey, you're thinking about being a leader
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.820]   in a church, but I want to look into your house. I want to look into your home." He
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:20.060]   doesn't separate them. He joins the two together. But how often do we actually look at someone
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.020]   and not really care about what their home is like? Not really care about what they're
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.460]   like in their personal life. We just look at their CV. We look at their experience.
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.860]   We look at their accolades and go, "Okay, you can be a leader." But we haven't checked
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:35.540]   into what their home is like. Actually, the secularization of the church sometimes has
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.460]   led to us just appointing leaders without looking and saying, "You know what? Family
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:45.500]   is so important." And only when you look at someone's family do you then see, "Okay, so
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:50.860]   this is how they run. Is this a God-fearing man?" Because a God-fearing man would lead
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:57.340]   a family who is also God-fearing. Now, of course, there are also exceptions to that
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.060]   in the sense that you can do everything you need to do as a parent, but maybe it's ultimately
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:06.540]   up to the kids who choose whether they follow Christ. But in terms of the whole household,
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:12.060]   what Paul is doing here, he is tying the church with the family. They are one and the same.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:17.860]   He's saying a well-ordered family leads to a well-ordered church. You just imagined a
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.060]   hospitable home that you walked into, but maybe think of another home that you walked
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.940]   into that was like, "Oh my goodness, this is absolute chaos." Imagine if that was a
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:33.540]   home, would a church thrive there? No. So Paul is here reminding, "Hey, you know what?
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:40.820]   The primary force, the primary platform for discipleship is where? Is in the family."
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.500]   God talks about this in the Old Testament in Deuteronomy 6. "Hey, love the Lord your
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.340]   God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and then teach them diligently to your children."
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.180]   When you stand up, when you sit down, when you walk over there, when you walk over there,
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.780]   hang it on your doorpost, hang it on your gate, put it on your ceiling. Love the Lord
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:02.500]   your God. He's saying these two are the same. Discipleship happens in the home. But you
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.140]   see, the problem here is this. Sometimes, and I'm terrified with this, and actually
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.780]   a lot of pastors are. You hear this term, "Pastor's kids," and you hear how they often
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.620]   go AWOL because they're just so used to being in the church and seeing all these things
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.580]   and doing all these things. But the one that really breaks my heart the most is when they
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.660]   sense hypocrisy in their parents, in their pastor's parents. Where they say, "Oh, my
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.860]   parents are so nice to the people outside, to the people that they're pastoring, but
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.420]   to me, they're nothing like that. In fact, I never see them at home." That's the thing
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:38.540]   that really drives me the most and is a constant reminder for me, is actually my children are
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.580]   my first line of ministry that I have to deal with.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.700]   And so for leaders, when you look at someone and you're thinking, "Could that person be
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.660]   a leader?" Paul's saying here, "Look at their home. Look at their family. Look at their
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.020]   wife." Because how they treat their wife and their kids, how they treat their home, will
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:58.260]   tell you a little bit about what kind of leader they are. This is a high bar. Then he carries
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:03.760]   on, verse six. "He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.820]   fall into the condemnation of the devil." He must not be a recent convert. That's an
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.980]   interesting one. Surely, the moment you accept Christ, we're all on equal ground. Surely,
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.140]   we're all allowed to be leaders from there. But Paul's saying no. Again, this is to do
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.980]   with the context of what was happening. The church was growing. The city was a vibrant,
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:26.820]   buzzing city. CEOs were coming in to the church. And CEOs were coming in, still being recent
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.820]   converts, knowing really nothing about the faith, apart from the fact that they feel
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.060]   as though they've encountered Jesus and they've given their lives to Jesus, but they still
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:38.060]   felt as though they were in control. And so then, and everyone else, knowing who they
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:43.740]   are, knowing how wealthy they are, they let them take the roles. Paul's saying, "No, no,
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.500]   that's not it. Don't let them, because they're still spiritual babies." And this is where
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:54.340]   we as a church constantly have to reflect. Are we placing people on pedestals when actually
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:58.300]   maybe they're not supposed to be there? It still comes back to the heart. It still comes
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:04.000]   back to character. But so, so often, so, so often, and I can say this, I can say this
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.640]   confidently and safely because I truly believe that our church here has a group of leaders
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.640]   and deacons who are truly God-fearing and God-honouring, but so, and who are not here
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:21.080]   by their own status, but so often, institutions and churches appoint people who are of worldly
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:30.080]   success and who bring those values into the church. And then we wonder why, that we can't
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   really separate the church and the world. Paul is saying here, God is saying here, "Choose
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.920]   your leaders carefully. These people have to be fearing of me." And they can't be recent
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.740]   converts. And finally, verse seven for this section, "Overseers, moreover, he must be
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.920]   well thought of by outsiders so that he may not fall into disgrace, into a snare of the
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.280]   devil." So people on the outside of the faith, people who aren't Christians, have to look
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.920]   at this person and go, "Oh, he's a good person." He has to be thought of. Why? The primary
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:04.320]   mission of the church at that stage, and it still remains to be at this stage, it's evangelism.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:12.040]   And he's saying, "Your leaders can't be weird. Your leaders can't be people who are rude.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.800]   Other people outside have to like them because the whole goal is to show them that we are
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.920]   different. The whole goal is to show them that Jesus is different, that he transforms
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:26.120]   our lives. And if they're not well thought of by the outsiders, they will fall into disgrace."
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.400]   So these are the elders. These are the overseers, the people who are pastors or shepherds. This
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.120]   is the modern day pastor, hopefully, should be. And then we move on to the second part,
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.520]   which is the qualifications for deacons. This is so business-like almost, but he makes it
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:46.620]   very clear. Who are deacons? The word deacons, the original word means the one who serves.
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.920]   And we first see deacons in Acts 6, where the apostles are so busy ministering to people,
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.640]   and then people weren't getting fed. And so a group of them said, "Hey, you know what?
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.160]   Apostles, you do you. We know that you're important and you're going to be ministering
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.760]   to people. We need some other people to help you distribute the food." So then they started
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:08.040]   appointing deacons, people who would help with the administration, the practical needs
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.480]   of the congregation. And we talked about some of the popular, famous ones. Acts 7, you've
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:18.080]   got Stephen. Acts 8, you've got Philip. And so deacons have continued to be part of the
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.640]   history of the church, and they've formed such a valuable part of the church because
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.960]   they're the ones who basically look after the practical needs of the church. But they
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.840]   also need to be qualified. They also have a high bar to reach. "Like deacons, likewise,
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.620]   verse 8, must be dignified, not double-tongued." They can't be gossipers. "Not addicted to
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:42.360]   too much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain." Again, we see here that power was a struggle,
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.960]   but also money was a struggle here. "They must hold the mystery of the faith with a
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.840]   clear conscience." A lot of the deacons, they're dealing with the practical needs of the congregation.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.420]   What does that often end up with? Dealing with money. And the corruption that was starting
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.760]   to even appear even in those days, Paul was addressing, saying, "Now, these people need
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.680]   to have a clear conscience. They need to be holding the mystery of the faith. They need
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.840]   to know why they're here. They need to know how they are saved. And they need to hold
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.560]   that tension and deal with all the practical needs of the congregation with a clear conscience.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.080]   "And let them also be tested first. Then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.320]   blamers." Let them be tested. These deacons must be tested. The two things that really
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.160]   pop up, commentators really talk about, one way is really that they need to be tested
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.480]   in terms of their beliefs, their doctrine. Again, it all goes back to the false doctrine,
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:36.760]   the heresies. These people need to be tested. They need to be doing the right things for
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.400]   the right reasons, believing in the right things. So tested, but also in the sense that
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.000]   these people need to be tested through some of the challenges of life. You don't truly
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.440]   know someone's true colors until they've gone through something hard. Only when they go
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.680]   through challenges for all of us, maybe these last two years, that's been the great exposure,
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:02.320]   right? It's been the biggest revealer of the heart of man. As soon as things go wrong,
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.920]   we start to see what's really in our hearts. And so Paul's saying here, don't rush it.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.240]   Don't appoint people who are recent converts. Don't appoint them if you haven't really tested
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:18.120]   them first. Take your time. It's that important. So, "And let them also be tested." Verse 11,
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:23.200]   "Their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.080]   all things. Let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:31.240]   households well." Verse 13, "For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.160]   for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus." So that's
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.400]   it. That's the job description that God places for overseers and for deacons.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:47.280]   And let me just stop right there for a second. How does that list make you feel? Maybe start
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.640]   with the first sentence there. How does this task make you feel? Is it something that you
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.560]   completely shirk away from? Or actually, is it something that you truly aspire to? Because
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.400]   those who aspire to it, aspire to a noble task. This is a good thing. And for those
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.080]   of us who are leaders, we need to check ourselves on this list, constantly asking God, "If you've
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.440]   called me to be a leader, what kind of leader should I be?"
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:16.880]   You see, I look at this passage and I see all of this, and often a lot of it is explanatory,
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.600]   but really the feeling that I got as I read through this, as I prepared this, is this,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:28.040]   and there's a statement that I put up there, that the world truly needs more godly leaders.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:32.200]   We look around, whether it's our churches, whether it's our families, whether it's
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.880]   the companies that are around, whether it's the cities, whether it is the countries, the
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:45.280]   world is in deep need for godly leaders. So the question to us is, where are these godly
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:53.600]   leaders? But these godly leaders cannot be of this world. We've just seen a job description
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:59.560]   that runs contrary to how the world appoints leaders, and it's important for us to ask
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:06.120]   ourselves that question. Are we aspiring to be the godly leaders that God has called us
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.920]   to be? Measuring ourself up to this list in chapter
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:18.800]   three, do we strive for these kind of standards? Do we live by example ourselves? The world
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.840]   needs more godly leaders, but the godly leaders cannot be of this world. You look at this
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:31.640]   list and you see that so often, even in the church, we have separated spirituality from
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.560]   our personal life, from our domestic life, from our professional life. But what Paul
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:41.600]   is saying here is that a true leader has integrity. What is integrity? What's a definition of
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:48.560]   integrity? Integrity is when someone is consistent and the same wherever they are, whether it's
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:54.920]   in the home, whether it's in the church, whether it's at work. And this is a good chance for
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:04.160]   us to reflect. Are we people of integrity? Am I the same wherever I go? Do I hold to
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:12.240]   the same values? Or am I really just a Sunday Christian or a Saturday evening Christian?
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   God, especially for leaders, demands the whole of our lives. He demands an integrity that
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:23.960]   crosses over every area. And it's important because if we don't get our leaders right,
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:30.960]   then our families, our churches won't be right. And leaders can only truly lead when they
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:37.120]   are pulling and not when they are pushing. This is something that my dad had often said.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:44.600]   He was a leader in the church and he was also a lecturer of MBA in university. So he spoke
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.840]   about leadership a lot. And he had this lame example, which I think I've shared sometimes,
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.000]   is leadership is like a string. You can only move that piece of string when you pull it
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.760]   in the direction that you're going yourself. You can never push a piece of string. The
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.560]   whole analogy, the point of that is a leader can't take a group of people where they're
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.960]   not willing to go themselves. And it starts with the leader. If the leader goes, then
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.040]   everyone else will go. The organisation, the family, the church will only go as far as
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   the leader is able to take them. And it starts with the leader. And the church, God has called
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.200]   the church to be a leader in the world. So we have to be the first ones to be a good
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:26.760]   example, to show love, to uphold truth, to pray, to be humble, to be gracious, to be
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:32.280]   merciful to the people outside, to be joyful. We have to be the ones that do it first. We
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:38.320]   have to be filled with integrity as we go about our way. So I've really talked about
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.560]   what an overseer is and what the Bible talks about, what a deacon is, and the fact that
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.240]   the world is in desperate need for godly leaders, but that these leaders also cannot be of this
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.200]   world. So I've talked about what a leader is and how they should be a leader. But really
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.840]   the question I want to finish with is why? What's the point in all of this? And it finishes
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:03.080]   off here with an interesting passage. I'm going to jump to verse 14 now. Verse 14 says
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.560]   this, "The mystery of godliness. I hope to come to you soon, but I'm writing these things
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:12.280]   to you so that if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God,
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.400]   which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth." So he's talking
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:22.520]   about the church. He's constantly charging Timothy to lead this church well. Why? Three
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:28.000]   things. He really highlights three key traits of the church. One, it's a household of God.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.120]   This is a home. Again, family and church, they are the same thing. I don't know whether
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.400]   when you walked into this church, whether you felt as though you were coming home. I
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.360]   loved what Johnny said earlier, "Welcome to this spiritual home." This has to be your
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.520]   home. This is not an institution. This is not a country club. This is not where you
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:49.000]   get entertained. This is not a cinema. This is a group of believers who all proclaim their
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.040]   faith in Jesus Christ, committed to each other, bound by the blood of Christ, coming together
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:26:01.640]   as a family. We are a household of God. We are not, by the way, a household of Peter
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:07.040]   or John or James. We are a household of God. So that's the first thing Paul says. This
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:14.120]   is a family. This is a family. When you're in a family, Chinese people understand this
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:18.960]   best, you bring something into the family. You are invested into the family. You are
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.920]   part of this family, whether you like it or not sometimes. What you can't do in a family
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:30.760]   is just simply sit back. Sit back and judge. Sit back and completely detach. That is not
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.920]   what it's about. We need leaders who know that this is a family. This isn't a corporation
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:42.880]   to run. This isn't a company that we're trying to grow. This is the household of God.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.000]   Second point then. First one is household of God. Second is, he's the church of the
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.040]   living God. Why does he specify living God? He's saying, "Hey, this is the church of the
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:56.120]   living God as opposed to all your other temples where there are dead gods." This is a living
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.880]   place. He's calling them out of the pagan world and saying, "Leave those idols. Leave
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:06.280]   those pagan gods and come to me because I am the living God. By the way, I am alive.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:12.320]   You are not in charge. I am in charge. I am the CEO of this church." There does not need
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.800]   to be a power struggle. I am here, by the way, guys. I don't know what you're arguing
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:24.560]   about. It's the church of the living God, which separates itself. Finally, the pillar
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.920]   and buttress of the truth. That word simply means defender of the truth. Coming back to
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.480]   it, the reason why we're here is because we have been revealed the truth and we know it
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:37.440]   is to be true. The church needs to be that. We need leaders who understand that it is
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:43.360]   a family. It is a house. We need leaders who understand that they are leaders, but the
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:48.520]   best leaders are the best followers of Christ. That these are leaders, but they are not God.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.080]   These are leaders. These are pastors. These are deacons, but they are not the CEOs of
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.200]   this institution. That this is the household of God, the living God. He is the one who's
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:02.760]   on the throne. You see this picture in Revelation 4 where you have all the 24 crowns and all
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.880]   the elders and all of them, they could easily, each one of those would terrify us if we saw
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.680]   any of them, but yet all of them are bowed down, worshipping the one who is truly on
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:18.520]   the throne. That's the kind of leader that we need in the church. People who have their
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:25.000]   eyes fixated on the true King. The best leaders are the best followers of Christ.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.560]   Then it really finishes with this, and this is the last verse, verse 16. It actually finishes
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.880]   with a song. So for worship people, you'll be pleased to see this. He finishes with a
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:39.360]   song, verse 16, "Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness. He was manifested
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:45.320]   in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:53.160]   on in the world, taken up in glory." He finishes by pointing, after talking about the job description,
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:59.800]   he points people to the only truly perfect leader. He's saying, "Hey, verses 1 to 13
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:07.240]   is a very high bar. It is impossible for you to get there yourself. But look, someone did,
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:12.600]   and that someone is Jesus." So you as a leader, when you're struggling with these things,
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.480]   you look to Jesus. You as a leader, when you're tempted just to throw these things away, look
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:24.360]   to Jesus. And what he has here in this verse 16, this panoramic view of his plan of salvation
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:30.400]   for all of us, he goes from Bethlehem to the ascension. He summarises who Jesus is, where
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:36.600]   he came from, and where he went. And he reminds people that it's all about Jesus. When you
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:43.760]   are struggling to be a leader, look to Jesus, the truly only perfect leader, and provides
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:52.680]   us with this sample, provides us with this model to follow. And I'll finish here. As
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:30:00.160]   we worship now, as we really meditate on what God has spoken to us, let us heed that call
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:08.560]   when God says, "Where is my church?" You are supposed to be leaders in this world.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:13.640]   And it doesn't have to be leaders of big corporations, of which I know some of you here are, in which
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:19.080]   case God has given you lots of influence, lots of power, which then comes with lots
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:26.960]   of responsibility, as the great theologian said in Marvel. But if you are like, "Oh,
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.120]   I don't know if I'm a leader." You are, because you are the salt of the earth and you are
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:39.080]   the light of the world. God has placed friends, placed colleagues, placed family around you
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:44.000]   who don't know about the true hope that can be found in Jesus. They haven't met the truly
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.120]   perfect leader. They might come and complain to you about their boss or their lecturer
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:54.080]   or their friends. Your job is to lead them, so that the perfect one who will never let
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:31:00.360]   them down. So take pride in that. Boast in the Lord that he has chosen you and placed
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:05.080]   you exactly where you are and called you to that place to reach that high bar with him
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:12.000]   and point people to him. All of us here are called to be leaders in some way. And my prayer
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.560]   is that we would answer God's call when he asks, "Where are the leaders?" And let us
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:27.240]   lead by example with integrity and filled with love. Let's pray.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   Jesus we look to you with all our flaws, with all the mistakes that we've made. But Jesus
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:54.240]   we do. We do truly aspire to lead. Truly aspire to be the people who get to lead others to
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:01.280]   you. But Lord we know that starts off with us following you first. Humbling ourselves,
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:07.120]   opening ourselves up to you, to committing to following you. And Lord you show us the
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:16.600]   perfect example of leadership. Lord you are the servant king. And you led in a way that
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:22.640]   was counter-cultural to the way this world leads. And we have fallen so far short because
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:32.680]   we think to lead we use our own might and use our own wisdom. And we rely on our own
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:46.160]   pride that drives us. So we humble ourselves before you right now. So lead us to the cross.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:53.280]   Lead us back to your feet. And again we pray for the leaders in this church and in this
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:33:04.280]   city. From the ones who only have one person to lead to those who have thousands. May we
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:12.480]   all fall at your feet as we lead. May we lead with the humility that you led with. May we
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:23.960]   lead with the integrity that you led with. May your church, may your body be leaders
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:35.360]   in love. To empower us Holy Spirit. Fill us up and send us out to be the leaders you have
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.200]   called us to be. Thank you Lord.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.780]   (gentle music)
