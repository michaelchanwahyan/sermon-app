1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,240
 - Hello everybody, it's so awesome

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,680
 to be able to speak to you tonight about Samson.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,680
 And we are well underway in our theme of the book of Judges.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,860
 And we've gone through chapter one and two,

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,080
 we went through Ehud, Deborah, Gideon,

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,920
 and all these other amazing Judges.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,040
 And today we are talking about Samson,

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,640
 the victory on Jawbone Hill.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,560
 Now to start off, it's gonna be a little bit interactive,

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,120
 get ready on the chat.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,920
 Who likes riddles?

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,000
 Anybody likes riddles here?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,720
 Okay, so what we're gonna do, this is the first riddle.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,920
 Okay, you can type the answer in the chat

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,840
 and maybe we'll have a prize for those who win, all right?

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,200
 I see Mark and Veronica getting ready.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,160
 What has a face and two hands, but no arms or legs?

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,840
 So what has a face, if we can go to that slide there.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,020
 Oh, very good, Mark, you're so good, you got it, very good.

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,080
 Okay, here's the second one.

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,320
 What five letter word becomes shorter

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,120
 when you add two letters to it?

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,820
 What five letter word?

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,280
 Wow, Hanani, wow, you guys are so good, all of you.

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
 You guys are our riddlers, all of you.

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,000
 And the reason why I wanted to start with a couple riddles,

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,660
 hello gets shorter, I guess, maybe, helloer.

29
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,640
 The reason why I wanted to start off with the riddle

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,960
 is because Samson was not only known for his strength,

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,440
 he was also known for his riddles.

32
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,120
 And so we're gonna start off Judges chapter 13.

33
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,080
 And how do you think Judges chapter 13 starts off?

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,740
 Actually, it starts off in exactly the same way

35
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,440
 as most of the chapters,

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,440
 that Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord.

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,880
 So the Lord delivered them into the hands

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,680
 of the Philistines for 40 years.

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,920
 And so we see in the book of Judges,

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,800
 this continuous cycle, right?

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,640
 That there's peace and then Israel sins.

42
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,640
 They get caught up in their neighbors.

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,360
 Oh, I see my neighbor has a nice idol

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,920
 or my neighbor has this or that.

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,760
 I wanna become my neighbor.

46
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,640
 And they fall into sin and they start to worship other gods.

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,900
 And what happens is God punishes them

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,140
 and sends people to oppress them.

49
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,360
 Just like this time,

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,480
 the Philistines were oppressing Israel.

51
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,660
 And then usually what happens

52
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,940
 is there's a time of repentance, right?

53
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,340
 They say, "Sorry, God,

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,980
 we can't endure this suffering anymore.

55
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,140
 Lord, please help us."

56
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,820
 And then God sends them Judges, right?

57
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,540
 Like Ehud, like Deborah,

58
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,020
 like the people that we've been going through

59
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,420
 all these weeks.

60
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,860
 But however, this week is a little bit different.

61
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,260
 Israel did not repent.

62
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,820
 If you notice in chapter, in verse one there,

63
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,660
 Israel did not repent,

64
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,500
 but yet the Lord still delivered them,

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,080
 delivered them, sent them a deliver.

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,480
 And that's because God wanted to deliver them

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,480
 out of the hands of the Philistines and their corruption.

68
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,580
 And slowly their gods would be influencing

69
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,700
 the way they talk and their thinking and their beliefs.

70
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,620
 And God wanted to take them away from that.

71
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,720
 And so God sent a deliverer.

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,700
 And we see in verse two, as we continue to read there,

73
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:00,820
 "A certain man of Zorah named Menorah

74
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,860
 from the clan of the Danites

75
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,380
 had a wife who was childless, unable to give birth.

76
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,060
 The angel of the Lord appeared to her and said,

77
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,140
 "You are barren and childless,

78
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,300
 that you are going to become pregnant

79
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,200
 and give birth to a son.

80
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,060
 Now see to it that you drink no wine

81
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,860
 or other fermented drink,

82
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,300
 and that you do not eat anything unclean.

83
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,060
 You will become pregnant and have a son

84
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,580
 whose head is never touched by a razor

85
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,940
 because the boy is a Nazarite,

86
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,780
 dedicated to God from the womb.

87
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,260
 He will take the lead in delivering Israel

88
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,360
 from the hands of the Philistines."

89
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,740
 And so this angel of the Lord appeared

90
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,740
 to Samson's father, Zorah, and his wife.

91
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:56,480
 And chapter 13 continues with this amazing dialogue

92
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,200
 between the angel and Zorah and his wife.

93
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,240
 And these are just amazing parents.

94
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,380
 They were like, "Wow, we're gonna have a child.

95
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,520
 How can we take care of this child?"

96
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,040
 And they were like, "God, can you send this angel,

97
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,980
 this man of God back to us

98
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,480
 so that we can learn how to take care of this child?"

99
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,460
 And the angel of the Lord,

100
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,060
 they didn't know it was an angel at first,

101
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,080
 came back and he said to them, "You will become pregnant.

102
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,160
 Your wife must do all that I have told her.

103
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,960
 You must not eat anything

104
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,800
 that comes from the grape wine, nor drink any wine

105
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,460
 or fermented drink, nor eat anything unclean.

106
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,740
 She must do everything I have commanded."

107
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,040
 The woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson.

108
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,520
 He grew and the Lord blessed him.

109
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,920
 And the spirit of the Lord began to stir him

110
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,880
 while he was in Mahana, Dan,

111
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,160
 and between Zorah and Eshtetl.

112
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,120
 All right, so we're gonna learn a couple things today

113
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,420
 about Samson the Nazarite.

114
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,200
 And we're gonna see five aspects of his story.

115
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,900
 Firstly, we're gonna see Samson's vow and then vice.

116
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,840
 He goes through some, everybody has their own vices.

117
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,080
 He goes through a period of affliction

118
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,780
 and then he has revenge and retaliation.

119
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,380
 Now, if you wanna remember these sort of points,

120
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,120
 you can remember VAR.

121
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,480
 I know some people don't like VAR for certain reasons

122
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,580
 because some goals are prevented.

123
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,860
 If you know what VAR is,

124
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,760
 you can have a Google of that if you don't know.

125
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,460
 And so VAR, the first one is vow, Samson's vow.

126
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,440
 Samson was a Nazarite.

127
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,000
 And what does it mean to be a Nazarite?

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,480
 Well, we see here that a Nazarite means to be separated

129
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,540
 or consecrated in special service for God.

130
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,980
 We see that in Numbers 6, verse 1 to 21.

131
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,920
 And what does it involve?

132
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,960
 It involves three restrictions, three restrictions.

133
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,520
 The first is you can't drink, okay?

134
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,360
 I know some people like their wine

135
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,460
 and this was one of the restrictions.

136
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,640
 You could not drink.

137
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,240
 Secondly, you could not cut your hair.

138
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,700
 I know, I'm sorry, Kathy,

139
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,840
 it wouldn't be good for your business, right?

140
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,940
 (laughs)

141
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,940
 If everybody was a Nazarite,

142
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,840
 it would not be good for the hairstylists.

143
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,880
 The last thing is you could not touch a dead body,

144
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,720
 human or animal, human or animal.

145
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,120
 And this is actually very similar

146
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,920
 to the vow of a high priest.

147
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,920
 The high priest also had these restrictions

148
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,860
 that they could not drink and similarly cut their hair

149
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,500
 or touch the unclean.

150
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,860
 And we see this in the book of Leviticus.

151
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,500
 If you look through the book of Leviticus,

152
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,100
 the high priest also has these certain

153
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,680
 similar sort of restrictions.

154
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,780
 And so we go to the story now.

155
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,220
 Let's look at the map of Israel.

156
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,060
 So Samson is in Zorah, okay?

157
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,760
 So Zorah is in the middle here.

158
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,560
 I don't know if you can see that.

159
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,600
 That's where the red line starts.

160
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,860
 Yeah, right there where the mouse is.

161
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,240
 And Bonnie's doing an excellent job there.

162
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,240
 So he is born in Zorah and he's gonna go to Timnah

163
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,940
 where he meets a certain woman.

164
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,940
 And later he will be going down to near the Mediterranean Sea

165
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,220
 and there's gonna be a battle there

166
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,260
 and we will continue and see the story.

167
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,560
 So we went through Samson's vow

168
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,260
 and then now we're gonna go through Samson's vice.

169
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,160
 And so we will continue to read in Judges chapter 14.

170
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,100
 "Samson went down to Timnah and at Timnah,

171
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,500
 "he saw one of the girls,

172
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,180
 "one of the daughters of the Philistines.

173
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,740
 "Then he came up and told his father and mother,

174
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,720
 "I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah.

175
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,880
 "Now get her for me as my wife.

176
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,280
 "But his father and mother said to him,

177
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,960
 "is there not a woman among the daughters of your relatives

178
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,160
 "or among all our people that you must go to take a wife

179
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,960
 "from the uncircumcised Philistines?

180
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,360
 "But Samson said to his father,

181
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,240
 "get her for me for she is right in my eyes."

182
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,500
 Now, if you see the highlighted text there,

183
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,220
 what Samson saw, he wanted.

184
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,460
 He saw the daughters of the Philistines.

185
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,720
 He saw this woman and he said,

186
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,360
 "She is right for me in my eyes."

187
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,620
 And so he wanted to marry this woman.

188
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,800
 And so they arranged a marriage

189
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,280
 and the parents went down to Timnah.

190
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,080
 And when they were on their way to Timnah,

191
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,560
 there was a lion.

192
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,800
 A lion came and rushed after them.

193
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,480
 I don't know if you've been hiking before,

194
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,800
 if you were hiking and then,

195
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,220
 oh no, there's a snake or oh no, there's a wild dog

196
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,160
 and you're all of a sudden alarmed, right?

197
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,040
 And you wanna run away, but Samson does not run away.

198
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,800
 And we see here in the next slide,

199
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,800
 then the spirit of the Lord rushed upon Samson

200
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,360
 and although he had nothing in his hand,

201
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,440
 he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat.

202
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,040
 You see in the picture here,

203
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,200
 Samson just tearing the lion, the jaws of the lion apart.

204
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,560
 Now, this painting, lovely painting is by Giordano.

205
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,640
 I don't think it's related to the Hong Kong fashion,

206
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,040
 but Giordano was a painter

207
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,920
 and he painted this picture of Samson and the lion.

208
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,340
 And so he went away, he killed the lion

209
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,700
 and then on his way back,

210
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,580
 somehow he was traveling back and forth.

211
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,900
 He saw the lion again and within the lion,

212
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,420
 what did he see within this dead carcass?

213
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,980
 There was honey, there was bees flying around, right?

214
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,780
 And imagine there's honey in a dead carcass,

215
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,620
 who would eat it?

216
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,860
 Honey from a dead carcass, anybody raise their hand.

217
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,040
 Mark, is that a hand up?

218
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,480
 No?

219
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,600
 I don't think anybody would really wanna eat honey

220
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
 from a dead carcass, right?

221
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,440
 But what he saw, he wanted.

222
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,640
 And yeah, exactly, Michelle, you don't wanna eat it, right?

223
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,700
 As much as you love honey in your tea.

224
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,640
 But he wanted what he saw

225
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,400
 and honey gave his mouth pleasure

226
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,240
 and he loved the sweet stuff and he ate it

227
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,640
 and he gave some to his parents without telling them

228
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,100
 that it was from a dead carcass.

229
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,260
 And so because he ate from this dead carcass,

230
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,060
 the honey from this dead carcass,

231
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,780
 he violated one of the restrictions.

232
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,680
 And what was that restriction?

233
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,540
 That you could not touch a dead body.

234
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,500
 And so Samson violated that.

235
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,060
 Next, he goes to his wedding banquet, right?

236
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,100
 And at a wedding banquet,

237
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,980
 you have feast and you have drinking

238
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,080
 and there the riddler within Samson comes out

239
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,400
 and he says to his guests

240
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,840
 and all his companions that were there,

241
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,700
 "If you can answer this riddle,

242
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,700
 "I will give you 30 garments and 30 clothes."

243
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,240
 Back then that was like amazing, right?

244
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,680
 It'd be like, oh, if you get this riddle,

245
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,420
 imagine if you were at Ben and Fanny's wedding, right?

246
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,620
 And you were just like,

247
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,920
 "Hey, I wanna give you guys a contest," right?

248
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,280
 Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

249
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,140
 It's a weird contest, but the groom says,

250
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,760
 "I wanna give you guys a contest.

251
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,820
 "I will give you 30 LV and 30 Gucci, right?

252
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,240
 "If you can answer this riddle

253
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,460
 "and at the end of seven days, if you can't answer it,

254
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,460
 "then you have to give me 30 linen garments and 30 clothes."

255
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,840
 And so this was the riddle.

256
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,200
 Out of the eater, something to eat.

257
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,640
 Out of the strong, something sweet, right?

258
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,320
 And that was obviously the lion, right?

259
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,320
 And so we see in verse 18 what will happen next.

260
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,600
 And so the Philistines that were there

261
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,880
 and celebrating at the banquet,

262
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,000
 they were stumped, right?

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,380
 I don't know.

264
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,500
 I don't know exactly how to answer this.

265
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,800
 I don't wanna lose 30 linen garments.

266
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,360
 I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose face, right?

267
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,380
 I wanna win, right?

268
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,440
 And so they go to his wife,

269
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,240
 this woman who is gonna marry Samson.

270
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,840
 And we're like, "How could you give us this shame?

271
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,280
 "We're gonna lose this contest, this riddle.

272
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,200
 "We're gonna lose it."

273
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,640
 And so they keep nagging and threatening his wife.

274
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,400
 And then his wife goes to Samson and like,

275
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,300
 "Oh no, Samson, you brought me such shame.

276
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,920
 "Like how could you do this, right?

277
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,980
 "In front of my own family and people and relatives,

278
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,980
 "how could you do this to me?"

279
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,980
 And he keeps nagging Samson day after day after day.

280
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,800
 And Samson just finally gives in and was like,

281
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,060
 "Finally, okay, I'll tell you the answer.

282
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,920
 "I haven't even told my parents

283
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,540
 "that I will tell you the answer."

284
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,860
 And so we see in verse 18 what happens.

285
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,640
 Before sunset on the seventh day,

286
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,540
 the men of the town said to him,

287
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,560
 "What is sweeter than honey?

288
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,240
 "What is stronger than a lion?"

289
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,700
 Samson said to them,

290
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,120
 "If you had not plowed with my heifer,

291
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,360
 "you would have not solved my riddle."

292
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,160
 And so at that time,

293
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,580
 then the spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him

294
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,400
 and he went down to Eshkodlin,

295
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,880
 struck down 30 of their men,

296
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,440
 stripped them of everything

297
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,600
 and gave their clothes to those

298
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,760
 who had explained the riddle.

299
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,820
 Burning with anger,

300
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,600
 he returned home to his father's home.

301
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,440
 And Samson's wife was given to one of his companions

302
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,780
 who attended the feast with him.

303
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,600
 So we see Samson's vice.

304
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,460
 His vice was he goes after what is in his eyes.

305
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,960
 What he sees,

306
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,420
 he sees that beautiful girl

307
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,700
 and he wants that beautiful girl.

308
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,000
 He sees the honey and is like,

309
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 "Wow, it's so sweet.

310
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,380
 "Wow, I want that."

311
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,260
 Right?

312
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,620
 And then he disobeys the Nazirite vow.

313
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,280
 And what happens?

314
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,580
 He also responds in anger.

315
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,260
 Right?

316
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,180
 He either wants with,

317
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,860
 he wants, he's a hedonist.

318
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,260
 He wants what his eyes see.

319
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,180
 He wants that taste of honey.

320
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,860
 And then he also has an anger issue.

321
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,700
 Right?

322
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,240
 And so that was Samson's vice.

323
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,100
 The next thing we see is Samson's affliction.

324
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,300
 His wife betrays him.

325
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,120
 Right?

326
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,480
 That wouldn't be very nice.

327
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,620
 Would you like your wife to betray you

328
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,500
 on your wedding banquet?

329
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,140
 That wouldn't be very nice.

330
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,940
 And then what happens afterwards?

331
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,940
 His father-in-law gives his wife over to his best man.

332
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,780
 Talk about drama.

333
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,420
 Days of our lives, right?

334
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,340
 This is crazy.

335
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:12,100
 His wife is given to his best man.

336
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,160
 His father-in-law betrays him.

337
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,580
 And so we see next Samson's revenge.

338
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,020
 He's angry and he goes down

339
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,820
 and causes,

340
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,060
 he kills all these people just to get the clothes

341
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,540
 for these Philistines.

342
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,300
 And next, what does he do?

343
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,580
 He catches 30 foxes.

344
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,420
 30 foxes.

345
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,220
 Has anybody caught a fox before?

346
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,060
 Yeah?

347
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,420
 Is it popular in the UK?

348
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,680
 I don't, I know they do fox hunting,

349
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,620
 but it might not be that easy, right?

350
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,740
 To catch foxes.

351
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,900
 Well, maybe he was also a beast master or something.

352
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,720
 I don't know.

353
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,940
 How do you catch 30 foxes?

354
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,220
 He must've been really fast

355
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,460
 or he must've had some bait or something, right?

356
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,780
 But he catches these foxes and ties them by the tail.

357
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,100
 And then he puts a torch,

358
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,020
 lights a torch between their tails.

359
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,740
 And he sends them off into the Philistines'

360
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,100
 grain and orchids.

361
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,660
 And of course, all of their grain is just on fire, right?

362
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,980
 And all their food is on fire.

363
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,900
 It's just, it's destruction everywhere, right?

364
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,900
 And the Philistines are like, how did this happen?

365
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,980
 Who is responsible for this?

366
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,340
 And the people were like, Samson is responsible.

367
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:38,560
 And so the Philistines go to the Israelite territory

368
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,500
 and attack the Israelites.

369
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,260
 And the Israelites were like, why are you attacking us?

370
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,940
 Like, we are under your rule and we accept it, right?

371
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,140
 But then the Philistines said to them,

372
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,860
 we only want one person and that is Samson.

373
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,780
 We want revenge on what he has done to us.

374
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,340
 And he's destroyed our crops and attacked our people.

375
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,340
 And so the Israelites went to Samson

376
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,740
 and was like, bro, what you doing?

377
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,460
 Bro, what you doing, man?

378
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,820
 You're causing all this conflict.

379
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,780
 And it's affecting us.

380
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,860
 The Philistines are our rulers.

381
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,980
 What are you doing?

382
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,620
 And so Samson was like, okay, I'll do as you guys say.

383
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,820
 You guys can bind me and take me to the Philistines.

384
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,820
 And so Samson was bound by straw and the hands

385
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,540
 and he was delivered to the Philistines.

386
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,140
 And as soon as he saw the Philistines,

387
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,700
 what happened?

388
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,180
 We see in the next slide.

389
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,860
 Then the spirit of the Lord rushed upon him

390
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,820
 and the ropes that were in his arms

391
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,540
 became as flax that has caught fire.

392
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,100
 And his bonds melted off his hand

393
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,940
 and the bonds melted off his hands.

394
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,340
 And he found a fresh jawbone from a donkey

395
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,580
 and put out his hand and took it.

396
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,300
 And with it, he struck a thousand men.

397
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,940
 Once again, this is artwork from Giordano,

398
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,500
 sponsored by Giordano today.

399
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,300
 And he took that jawbone

400
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,620
 and just totally destroyed a thousand Philistines.

401
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,620
 What a crazy battle it must've been.

402
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,540
 A thousand on one.

403
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,540
 You would have thought the Philistines

404
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,500
 would have had a better strategy.

405
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,740
 You know, a thousand to one,

406
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,420
 maybe have a better formation or I don't know,

407
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,340
 maybe track them somewhere.

408
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,260
 Like a thousand to one and he has a jawbone?

409
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,340
 Come on, right?

410
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,060
 But the spirit of the Lord was the one that empowered him.

411
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,060
 The spirit of the Lord,

412
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,500
 we see that empowering in his life several times.

413
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,340
 And so what can we learn from the story of Samson today?

414
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,180
 What can we learn?

415
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:05,180
 The first thing is that just as God called Samson

416
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,940
 to be a Nazirite, the Nazirite vow,

417
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,180
 consecrated, separated for the service of the Lord.

418
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,180
 God has also called us for those who are in Christ Jesus,

419
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,100
 who have confessed him to be Lord and Savior.

420
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:27,020
 God has called us to be his holy people, right?

421
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,020
 God has also told us that we are to be his light

422
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,420
 and his salt, to be a city on a hill.

423
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,620
 God has called us to be his people.

424
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,700
 I believe that for all of us,

425
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,620
 God has a general calling

426
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,940
 and God also has a specific calling for you.

427
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,700
 It might be a specific calling to go and work

428
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,260
 in the financial field.

429
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,700
 It could be a specific calling to work in high school

430
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,500
 or to reach a certain group of people.

431
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,940
 I remember when I was 14 and at church,

432
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,740
 we have the summer camp and during summer camp,

433
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,940
 we have a dedication night.

434
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,660
 The first dedication is dedicating ourselves to the Lord,

435
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,900
 to be our Lord and Savior.

436
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,420
 The second is to live for Christ

437
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,260
 and the third one was to go into full-time ministry.

438
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,860
 I wanna devote my life to become a pastor or a missionary

439
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:33,140
 and when I was 14, I felt the Spirit of the Lord

440
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,220
 come into my heart and I was so emotional.

441
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,120
 I felt him calling me and saying,

442
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,260
 "Jesus has given up everything for me."

443
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,100
 What is my response?

444
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,140
 What is my response?

445
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,420
 And my response was like,

446
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,020
 if Jesus has given everything for me,

447
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,380
 I should give everything to the Lord as well

448
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,940
 and I stood up and said,

449
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,020
 "I am willing, Lord, to go wherever you call me

450
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,980
 "and if it's to be a pastor or to be a missionary,

451
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,340
 "I want to obey your calling."

452
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,460
 And I didn't know at that time what it would be like,

453
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,980
 what my journey would be,

454
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,140
 but I was willing to obey the Lord and his calling.

455
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,260
 And so what is God's calling for your life?

456
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,420
 God has a general calling for us

457
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,540
 to go and share the gospel, to be his light,

458
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,620
 to be his holy people,

459
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,300
 but God may also have a specific calling for you

460
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,980
 to reach a certain people group,

461
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,200
 to work in a certain vocation,

462
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,580
 to go into full-time ministry.

463
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,280
 What is God's calling for you?

464
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,580
 The second thing we learn from the story of Samson

465
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,340
 is that we can choose.

466
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,900
 We have a choice.

467
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,500
 Samson chose his vice,

468
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,900
 his vice of his eyes.

469
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,660
 He sought after what he saw with his eyes.

470
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,840
 He was a hedonist.

471
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,200
 That we can choose victory over sin.

472
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,780
 We can choose victory instead of vice.

473
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,720
 And there are so many temptations in our life today.

474
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,920
 Satan tries to throw so many curve balls at us

475
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,560
 to steer us away from God, to following God.

476
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,000
 Just like Israel, they were like,

477
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,280
 "Oh, Philistines have this God.

478
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,960
 "They have this ruler.

479
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,820
 "We want this, we want that."

480
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,140
 They were influenced by that.

481
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,220
 And it's so easy to be influenced by our culture

482
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,120
 and the people around us.

483
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,700
 But instead of choosing our vices,

484
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,060
 we all have weaknesses.

485
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,300
 We can choose victory over sin.

486
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,700
 We can choose victory over sin.

487
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,320
 And the third point is this,

488
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,020
 that the spirit of the Lord empowers us.

489
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,460
 The spirit of the Lord was working when Samson was born.

490
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,960
 The spirit of the Lord was working when the lion came.

491
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,860
 The spirit of the Lord came upon him

492
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:18,280
 when he defeated the people, the Philistines with a jabba.

493
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,820
 The Holy Spirit empowers us.

494
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,420
 We can't live the Christian life on our own strength.

495
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,860
 We need the Holy Spirit.

496
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,960
 And that's the gift of the Holy Spirit.

497
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,240
 If you have confessed Jesus to be your Lord and Savior,

498
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,300
 you have the Holy Spirit inside of you.

499
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,080
 You have God inside of you.

500
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,680
 That's so amazing.

501
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,380
 And this Holy Spirit convicts us of our sin.

502
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,280
 It guides us in the way we should go.

503
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,500
 It empowers us to do things

504
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,120
 immediately more than we can ask or imagine.

505
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,600
 God has commissioned us to go to the ends of the earth,

506
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,060
 to share the gospel, to make disciples of all nations.

507
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,720
 Are you willing to be empowered by the Holy Spirit?

508
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,020
 Surrender to him.

509
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,320
 So the third point was commission.

510
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,340
 And the last thing is this,

511
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,620
 that God can make good out of evil.

512
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,120
 God can make good out of evil.

513
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,640
 Samson wasn't really a good judge, right?

514
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,640
 Like he just went after his temptations.

515
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,640
 He responded in anger.

516
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,060
 These things are not what the Lord wants us to do, right?

517
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,880
 But God made good out of evil.

518
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,760
 God made good out of evil.

519
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,760
 He used Samson as a way to have deliverance

520
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,240
 against the Philistines.

521
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,320
 And we see this throughout history,

522
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,460
 that God uses the weak things of this world

523
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,660
 to shame the wise, to shame the strong.

524
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,480
 You know, Apostle Paul had conflict

525
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,160
 with the other disciples, other apostles, right?

526
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
 It was Silas, right?

527
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,560
 Or Barnabas, he had conflict with them.

528
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,240
 You know, Silas wanted to take Mark,

529
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,600
 but Paul was like, "Mark, you know,

530
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,380
 he deserted me on my last missionary trip.

531
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,120
 I don't wanna take Mark."

532
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,000
 And so they had conflict with each other and they split off.

533
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,120
 But God still used their conflict for good

534
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,120
 to share the gospel in different places in minor Asia.

535
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,760
 God can make good out of evil.

536
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,960
 And even if we fall, and we will fall sometimes,

537
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,160
 God is like a GPS, right?

538
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,400
 Who's used the GPS before?

539
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,700
 Sometimes it can be quite annoying, right?

540
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,760
 Please make a U-turn,

541
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,720
 or it's usually in a British accent, right?

542
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,040
 Please make a U-turn.

543
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,200
 Turn left here.

544
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,040
 No?

545
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,680
 Okay, you can switch languages, I think, or accents.

546
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,680
 But the GPS always tells you where you've gone wrong.

547
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,500
 It says, "Take a U-turn here.

548
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,280
 You've gone the wrong direction."

549
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,880
 It sends you another route.

550
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,080
 Terrible English accent.

551
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,340
 Yes, James, your accent is much better.

552
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,920
 (laughs)

553
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,320
 And God is like that.

554
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,480
 He's always pursuing us.

555
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,080
 Just like the song we sang,

556
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,840
 God is rushing after us.

557
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,960
 He's pursuing us.

558
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,080
 And God is like a GPS.

559
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,240
 And this is from Francis Chan,

560
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,920
 that God is like a GPS.

561
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,660
 And the next thing is,

562
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,980
 not only does God make good out of evil,

563
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,020
 he is working even when we don't see it.

564
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,700
 God is working in miraculous ways.

565
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,160
 For our good, he works for the good of those who love him.

566
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:09,040
 And he wants you to fulfill your calling, glorify him,

567
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:16,300
 to choose victory over vice.

568
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,260
 He wants you to go out to be commissioned

569
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,860
 with his power and authority

570
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,180
 and the power of the Holy Spirit

571
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,140
 to make disciples of all nations,

572
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,540
 go to the ends of the earth.

573
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,440
 And he wants you to know that he is in control.

574
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,440
 Even in 2020, when everything seems like it's a mess,

575
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,060
 or even right now, maybe you feel isolated.

576
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,140
 Maybe you feel like things aren't going the way

577
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,900
 that you want it to.

578
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,300
 God is still working.

579
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,660
 He loves you.

580
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,180
 He cared for the Israelites.

581
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,260
 He cares for you.

582
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,880
 And he wants you to pursue him.

583
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,180
 Let's pray together.

584
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,740
 Heavenly Father, we thank you for the story of Samson.

585
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,900
 And even though he did not do a lot of good things,

586
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,300
 you still used him to make good out of evil.

587
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,300
 I pray, Lord, that we can learn from his mistakes.

588
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,660
 And instead of choosing our vices, we would choose victory.

589
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,740
 That we would choose to be empowered by the Holy Spirit,

590
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,380
 to surrender to the Holy Spirit,

591
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,320
 and to know that you are in control.

592
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,140
 Even in the midst of this virus,

593
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,020
 even in the midst of social distancing, you are in control,

594
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,500
 and you have what is best for us.

595
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,820
 Bless us, Lord, as we respond in song.

596
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,540
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.
