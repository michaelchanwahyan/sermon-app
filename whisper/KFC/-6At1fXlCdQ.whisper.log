[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   - Thank you very much, James.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Yes, so for those who don't know me, my name is Joe.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.080]   I am James's brother.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.240]   Some of you might think, "Oh, they kind of sound alike.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.680]   They kind of speak alike."
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.200]   The truth is we're not that much alike at all.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.280]   Clearly, I use a lot more shampoo than he does.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.280]   Some of you will get that later.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.920]   I'm a lot more handsome, a bit taller.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.440]   But one thing we do have in common is actually our mission.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.120]   We've actually been living separately for about 10 years in different countries and
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.120]   different continents.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.040]   It's actually only recently that we got together in Hong Kong.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.360]   It's actually very special to serve with him, especially on my wedding weekend.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.680]   Thank you.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.880]   Thank you.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.880]   Thank you.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.640]   I actually want to give a special shout out to Pastor John, if he's watching, and the
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.400]   team, anyone who was involved in hiring James.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.720]   You gave him a young, a very talented, a very bolding pastor from England, and they took
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.720]   him to Hong Kong.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.480]   And because you guys gave Pastor James a chance, I got to meet my lovely mother and father-in-law
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.680]   future, Agnes and Vincent.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.120]   Because of Gauntwood Church taking a chance on James, I got the chance to meet the love
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.920]   of my life, and I get to marry her in two days' time.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.440]   So, very, very good.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.920]   It has been a busy weekend.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.920]   I'm going to be honest.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.360]   And apologies if I have a lot of wedding talk coming out of my mind, but there's two things
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.240]   that I need to do, which is the two S's.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.960]   I just need to shower and show up on Monday.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.640]   Differently, Alex has spent the whole week doing her nails, doing her lashes, doing her
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.080]   hair, dress fitting, and it's been a busy week.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.360]   But so many people, I could just see this picture of so many different bridesmaids,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.080]   and bridesmaids, and so many friends helping Alex prepare for her big wedding day.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.200]   That actually draws a parallel to a bigger picture of a bigger wedding.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   How the church, how we need to prepare the church for our big wedding day when Jesus
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   comes back for the bride.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.680]   And so today we're going to talk about missions and how do we prepare the church for that
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.680]   day.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.720]   I'm going to start off with a quick question.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.960]   I have the slide here.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.000]   Within 15 months after the earthquake in Haiti, and you've managed to raise a million dollars
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.520]   to help with the recovery, you start to research different organizations that work there.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.040]   What would be the first question you would ask?
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.840]   What's the first question that you would ask them?
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.040]   Now many of you might ask actually, where does my money go?
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.720]   How does my money actually help the people on the ground?
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.560]   How many people can be helped on the ground?
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.440]   How quick can the resources get to the people on the ground?
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.720]   How many people does $1 help?
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.280]   So we ask all these very practical metric questions.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.800]   But actually the first question we should ask, first question that I actually ask before
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.240]   I join any charity that I work for is a very simple question.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.880]   Is how do you define poverty?
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.240]   Because how we define poverty would actually determine how we respond to poverty.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.880]   There's a lot of doctors, people in the room, if you have a wrong diagnosis, you're going
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.680]   to be using the wrong solution, the wrong medicine.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.360]   And so it's very important to actually get the right definition of poverty before we
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.360]   actually begin.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.040]   So let me ask you this question.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   What do you picture?
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:30.280]   What do you envision when I tell you a group of people living in extreme poverty?
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.320]   In Hong Kong, you might think of people living in caged homes, just blocks down the road
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   from here.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.960]   Some of you might even think of a slum community somewhere on the African continent or in Brazil
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.080]   or South America.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.800]   I like to choose these images, some of you actually might picture images of children
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.000]   malnourished, starving, with maybe a fly on their nose and just this really sad picture
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   of them.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.400]   That's probably the picture that we think of straight away because that's what charities
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.880]   and marketing has done for us when we think about extreme poverty.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.880]   I don't like to use those pictures because I feel like they take away the dignity of
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.880]   the people that we're trying to help.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.320]   And actually, one thing that I actually could talk to you about is poverty is complex.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.000]   I remember the first time I got to encounter poverty face to face.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.320]   I was a teenager at the time and I went to Uganda.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.720]   I think I was about 17.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.440]   It actually all started from one afternoon where I skipped school and I went to watch
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   a movie and I just forgot that my mum's here and I just told her that I skipped school.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.560]   And don't worry, it wasn't something I did regularly, once or twice a week.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.440]   But funny story, actually, James taught at the same school that I was attending, so the
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.480]   teachers were okay and they weren't too good.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.480]   I wasn't missing much.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.240]   But occasionally, I would have these weekends where I'd go, instead of going to class, I'd
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.080]   go and educate myself in the AMC Institute, the AMC cinemas.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.080]   And in that particular day, I went to watch a movie called The Last King of Scotland.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.680]   Has anyone seen that movie?
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.680]   Yeah?
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.580]   Fantastic movie, James McAvoy, an incredible actor.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.400]   It's about the Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin, and the oppressive rule that he lived and
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   ruled in, in Uganda at the time.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.800]   I remember sitting at the cinema thinking to myself, how is this happening?
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.680]   How is it that there's a whole group of young people my age in Uganda that are sometimes
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.560]   sent into being child soldiers, sent into doing horrible, horrible things, and I'm sitting
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.580]   here on a Thursday afternoon, not in my geography class, but in AMC cinemas, and I realised something
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.580]   was horribly wrong.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.080]   And so no matter what definition we have for poverty, we can all agree on one thing, that
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080]   it is wrong.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.560]   That this, that picture that I showed you before, this is not what God had in mind when
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.000]   he said in Genesis 131, and it is good.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   We all agree with that.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.920]   World Bank actually talks about poverty as those who live under $1.90 a day.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.160]   So anyone who lives under that line lives under the poverty line, in extreme poverty.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.400]   And I got to first encounter extreme poverty after watching Last King of Scotland in that
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.400]   movie.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.120]   And I remember a few months later, I had so much compassion that it led to action.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.560]   And literally four months after watching that movie, I was out there face to face with people
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.200]   who lived under the regime of Idi Amin.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   And I spent my whole summer in Uganda volunteering.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.120]   I was primarily doing two things.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.960]   I was painting schools, and I was teaching.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.640]   Two things that I'm terrible at.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.520]   And my fiance knows I'm not a DIY person.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.520]   So here I was painting schools, mixing concrete, trying to build an extra classroom in the
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   school.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.560]   And the rest of the time I was teaching English.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.580]   And I had to think to myself, why did I fly all the way here, across the world, to do
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.640]   two things that I'm not very good at?
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.360]   I was like, God, there must be a better way.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.120]   There must be a more effective way to help people.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.280]   And that's actually when I first learned about the term voluntourism.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.760]   We're actually, we hear a lot of actually stories on the ground where after a group
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.000]   of volunteers would come, they'd paint the school.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.680]   The locals would then repaint it back to grey so the next batch of volunteers can come from
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.820]   America, from England, and they'd paint the school again.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.800]   Just because they need something for them to do, to feel good about themselves, to take
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.600]   some nice pictures, and to go back and feel like heroes.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   And that's sad.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   That's a sad reality.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.400]   And I learned that early on, and I really, looking back at that summer, I probably was
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.200]   doing a little bit more harm than good.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.080]   Because all the jobs that I did that summer, a local could have been employed and done
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.360]   a ten times better job than me.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.000]   This story though, this story, a man of a hut, you can't picture, you can't see him
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   there, but he's got a red t-shirt.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.320]   There was a time after we were teaching, we would go to hut to hut, village to village,
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.760]   to get to greet the people, get to know the people.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.000]   We're handing out food, handing out medicine.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.840]   And I remember this man in particular.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.920]   He came, he welcomed me, he says, "Hey, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, come inside, come inside."
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.840]   And we have two Jackies here, Jackie Chows.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.120]   Anywhere in this part of the world, when they see an Asian face, they're like, "Jackie
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.880]   Chan, Jackie Chan."
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.960]   So I actually tell them that I'm his nephew, and most people actually believe me.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.840]   So I just hope that Jackie doesn't find out or watch this one day.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.200]   But he said, "Jackie Chan, come inside, come inside."
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.240]   And he gave me a sugar cane juice, I remember very clearly.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.480]   And he said this, he said, "Look at my roof, look at my roof."
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.040]   And I said, "Oh wow, yes, we can fix that.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.040]   Let me fix that for you.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.600]   I can go to the ATM, get some money, get some things, and we can fix that roof for you."
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.480]   And he's like, "No, no, no, no, no, what's wrong with my roof?
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.480]   I love my roof.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.120]   I want to tell you a story about my roof.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.560]   I've been working hard for two years, I've been saving, God has been so good, and I've
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.720]   been able to build this roof myself.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.240]   And today, it was raining and it didn't leak.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.880]   Isn't God amazing?
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.720]   Isn't he faithful?"
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.560]   And at that moment, I realized something terribly, terribly wrong with my attitude and my posture.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:49.200]   Here I was, a 17-year-old, cocky 17-year-old, with a bit more cash in my wallet, trying
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.760]   to go and fix everyone else's problems.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.800]   A problem that they'd even ask for me to fix.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.680]   And I realized how embarrassed I felt, how humiliated I felt, offering this man and pointing
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.500]   out to him that this roof wasn't good enough.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.120]   In my mindset, all I saw was material poverty, and my mindset was to fix them and give them
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.480]   everything that I had in England to him.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.160]   And he'd be happy if I give him a roof, if I give him a Wi-Fi, if I give him everything.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.760]   And I was willing to do that.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.680]   My action, my intentions were right.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.520]   But the ironiest thing is, if I gave him everything that I have from England, is he going to be
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.520]   happy?
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.240]   Because are we happy back in England?
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.240]   I look at England, I see highest divorce rates, highest suicide, depression, anxiety rates.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.560]   Are we happy because we have all these things?
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.520]   And we can quickly think and say, "No, there must be something more.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.840]   There must be, must be something better in how to help people."
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.680]   And I promised myself that at that moment, I said, "God, I want to help people without
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.880]   taking away their dignity again.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.840]   I never want an encounter with what happened with the man in the red t-shirt there again."
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.560]   Because I really wanted to do better.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.520]   And so this is kind of what happens.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.480]   I'm going to run through this kind of is how to walk with the poor 101 today.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.880]   James is going to come up a little bit later and share kind of what Jesus says about it.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.400]   But this is kind of the problem.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.880]   I realized that I was the problem, and that my view on poverty was simply material.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.000]   And I had carried these first world superior God complexes to go and help someone.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.400]   And what happens is I go and inflate my ego a little better.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.440]   I go back home and I'm the hero spending a whole summer in Uganda.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.640]   And the people that I help feel more inferior.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.080]   They look at their roof and think it's not good enough.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:34.000]   And so when we go in with that attitude, as a result, things get worse.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.800]   And it's helping can actually hurt.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.360]   So back to the question I asked earlier, how do you define poverty?
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.160]   How do you define poverty?
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.760]   Now one of the dangers is we can easily stand in this comfortable room or in the UN office
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.780]   in Switzerland or World Bank and define poverty.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.080]   But truly none of us are really going through it.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.040]   So we might actually diagnose something that we haven't even gone through.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.040]   I spent two years of my life living in a place called Bolivia.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.140]   I lived with a pastor and his family in a compound.
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.320]   We were by far the world's slowest growing church.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.860]   Because we would only take in people with HIV and AIDS.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.320]   And nobody would want to check out our church because they think if you sat next to someone
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.440]   with HIV/AIDS you'd catch it, which is impossible.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.920]   Doctors can tell you more about that.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.040]   But in fact, there was a lady by the name of Laura.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.560]   She had a special place in my heart because every time she had to go into the town for
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.880]   treatment I would look after her two year old son Isaac.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.520]   And these treatments would be weeks at a time.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.120]   And I remember during the two years I actually had an evening where I got to chat with her.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.160]   I said, "Laura, look, I've lived here for two years.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.680]   Yes, I speak your language.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.560]   I've learned to even look and be more local.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.760]   But I still don't know what it means to truly come from extreme poverty.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.720]   What is it like for you?"
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.760]   Because I didn't want to define poverty in my own way anymore.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.560]   I wanted to ask the people who are actually living through it.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.080]   And she gave me a response I'll never forget.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.080]   And she said, "Joe, for a poor person everything is terrible.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.920]   Illness, humiliation, shame, and fear.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.920]   We depend on everyone and no one needs us.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.200]   We are like trash that everybody wants to get rid of."
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.720]   This is the last picture I took of Laura.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.880]   A few weeks after that, actually, the last picture I took of Laura.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.040]   And a few hours after that she passed away and I had to drive about eight hours to the
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.360]   village to give Isaac back to her grandma.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.200]   I'll never forget that response that Laura said because not once did she say, "Oh, I
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.760]   wish I had an iPhone.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.920]   I wish I had a handbag.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.920]   I wish I had a roof.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.920]   I wish I..."
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.920]   No.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.320]   Nothing was material.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:44.280]   Everything to her was something so deep, so personal, so emotional, and so spiritual.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.560]   And so we're going to actually look at what the Bible says.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.560]   What is poverty?
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.320]   How does the Bible define poverty?
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.340]   And there's a lot of management consultants here.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.800]   With every problem you're going to have to find the root.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.000]   Where did it begin?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.680]   And we're going to go back to the origin story to actually find out how there is four dimensions
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.680]   of poverty.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.360]   The spiritual, social, personal, and material.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:10.720]   We actually can trace it back in Genesis 2 when we think of the garden and Adam and Eve.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.160]   Because as you think of poverty, was there poverty in the Garden of Eden?
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.160]   There wasn't.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.000]   So there was a moment in time when there wasn't poverty and there became poverty.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.800]   And we actually link it back using Adam and Eve as an example where when sin entered the
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.520]   world there was four broken relationships.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.120]   And these four broken relationships led to four dimensions of poverty.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.800]   We think of Adam and Eve.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.320]   Adam initially had a great relationship with God.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.920]   He was very close with God.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.320]   But instead of feeling intimate and in love with God, Adam and Eve were expelled from
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.320]   the garden.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.440]   So for the first time there was spiritual poverty.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.400]   That relationship God and man was broken.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.520]   There was social poverty.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.300]   Adam and Eve were best friends living in harmony.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.480]   And suddenly with sin, Adam and Eve were starting to blame one another and they had power struggles
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.560]   and that started to bicker.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.840]   Personal poverty entered the world as Adam didn't feel secure anymore.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.560]   He started feeling shame and humiliation.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.800]   And last of all, of course, there's material poverty entered the world where God said growing
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.160]   and there was going to be toil to work and natural disasters came into play.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.880]   Growing crops and farms wasn't easy anymore.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.520]   So that's the root of the problem.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.520]   That's the origin of where the four dimensions of poverty came from.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.320]   It came from four breakdowns in relationships.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.040]   Now I'm going to link that from Adam and Eve to the people that Hope International serves
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040]   today.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.600]   As James mentioned, I spent pretty much all my adult life living in Bolivia and Zambia.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.120]   And Hope International, we work in 16 different countries.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.600]   We not only work in the countries that are living under the poverty line, we work with
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.240]   the communities in that country that are marginalized, that are underserved, where there's least
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.240]   NGO presence.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.360]   And something we see time and time again, everyone that we help, we see the four dimensions
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.800]   of poverty play out.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.800]   Spiritual poverty, we see a lot of people in Haiti that we're working on a lot this
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   year.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.720]   We work with people who believe in witch doctors.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.280]   We work a lot in South Asia, where a lot of people believe in millions of different gods.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.120]   And I can tell you story after story how some of these witch doctors, people would go to
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.440]   them for advice in order to get out of poverty.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.520]   And the response to them was actually sometimes to go and do horrible, evil things, even to
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.260]   the point of killing small children in order to get out of poverty.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.840]   So we're listening to the wrong voices, and that is great spiritual poverty.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.040]   You can't throw money at that.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.560]   You can give them money and they're actually going to end up way, way worse until they
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.600]   realize God and they need to listen to God.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.120]   We see a lot of social poverty.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.800]   Alex, last year, my fiance was living in Myanmar.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.520]   Right now they're going through a civil war.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.240]   There's two groups of people who want to kill each other.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.020]   Again, the economy, the GDP is not going to grow if there's two groups of people trying
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.120]   to kill each other.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.780]   You can't give them jobs and give them money to fix it.
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.060]   It's a deeper social problem.
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.820]   There's a lot of personal poverty in the places we serve.
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.600]   In India, for example, there's different caste systems.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.540]   You're born a woman in some of these countries.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.560]   The confidence in everything that you get is very different.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.440]   Something I didn't share about Laura, the lady in Bolivia, was actually at the time
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.320]   I helped her find her first job.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.920]   I even got past her interview without even going.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.480]   The truth is she never turned up on her first day because she didn't have the confidence.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.660]   She was so, so defeated in her own value.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.840]   She felt so worthless that I managed to find a job for her, but she couldn't even go to
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.840]   the first day.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.120]   Again, it's not a problem of material or money.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.440]   She needs to first solve the personal poverty that she has.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.600]   Finally, in the places we work, we see a lot of material poverty, corrupt governments,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.440]   broken systems, a lot of natural disasters like Haiti, time, year after year, that trap
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.480]   people in poverty.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.880]   Going on from what we see today and how the four dimensions of poverty plays out in our
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.240]   world today, I want to share one more story about a group of people I also encountered
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.240]   and work with.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:58.760]   However, their poverty manifests itself in a little different way.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.640]   This group of people, I'll see if you guys know and figure out who they are.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.600]   This group of people have deep spiritual poverty.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.800]   Many of them don't believe in God.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.520]   They have no relationship with God.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.280]   Instead, they think that they are God, so they go around living life thinking that they're
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.320]   in control of everything.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.680]   This group of people also maybe not listen to witch doctors, but they would worship their
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.680]   ancestors.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.960]   They would maybe pay masters and feng shui masters to tell them how to get rich.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.960]   Again, this group of people are listening to the wrong voices.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.760]   This group of people also live in deep social poverty.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.360]   There's towers and towers of apartments.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.320]   They live together next to each other, but no one knows each other's names.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.320]   There's family gatherings every year, but there's always people missing because they're
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.000]   arguing about money.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.880]   They're arguing because they have different political or social views.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.480]   There's deep spiritual poverty.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.440]   There's also a lot of personal poverty in this group of people.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.560]   They might exteriorly look very powerful and well put together, but inside there's so much
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.520]   shame, there's so much anxiety, and they worry.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.880]   They have insomnia, depression, a lot of addictions and alcoholism and gambling.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.120]   This group of people suffer from deep personal poverty on the inside.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.440]   Finally, this group of people also in the city has a lot of material poor.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.040]   They don't care for them.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.160]   There's many homeless people living in McDonald's.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.440]   There's refugees without homes and education.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.520]   They don't care for the environment.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:24.720]   They pollute it in order to grow their GDP and in fact, causing global warming.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.240]   Even some don't even believe in global warming.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.680]   Does this group of people ring a bell?
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.760]   Can you guys recognise anybody that lives in this type of poverty?
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.720]   Well, I'm going to answer the question for you.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.280]   Who are the poor?
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.240]   The first thing we need to know before we help do anything, before we help people, we
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.280]   need to number one, recognise the poverty in our own lives.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.760]   We need to recognise that.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:51.760]   We are the poor.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.760]   I am the poor.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.440]   I grew up with a deep fear of public speaking, believe it or not.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.040]   I was super, super anxious.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.880]   I would have severe panic attacks before I get on stage.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.680]   This personal poverty is probably not so different to a material poverty for a lady living in
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:12.840]   a slum in Brazil, which is not very different to someone maybe living in total social poverty,
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.440]   in isolation in a mansion somewhere on the peak.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.680]   These three levels of poverty aren't that different.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.240]   The reason is there's only one solution and the solution is found in a person in the name
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240]   of Jesus.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:30.960]   In Colossians 1.19, Jesus says, "He comes to reconcile all things," which means he is
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.160]   the only one who can bring and restore all four relationships and break down all four
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.520]   dimensions of poverty.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.680]   So, church, number one thing is before we help anyone, you probably never hear this
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.000]   at church, but please stop helping people before you figure out one and two.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.720]   Number one, realise the poverty in your own life.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.320]   You know, Jesus talked about, "Don't look at the speck in someone else, look at the speck
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.320]   that you have in your eye."
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:59.080]   Number two is if we're going to help people, make sure that we preach the name of Jesus.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.840]   We can help people materially, but it's just going to be a band-aid.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.520]   Unless we allow Jesus to restore all four dimensions of poverty, it's not going to be
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.840]   sustainable.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:13.520]   And because we need to preach Jesus, we need to work and empower the local church.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.640]   One thing that I love about the organisation I work with is we work in 16 countries.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.120]   We never want our name to be that famous, more than the local church.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.960]   The people, the two, three million families that we help, we want them to thank the local
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.880]   church, not Hope International.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.120]   And our job is to work ourselves out of a job.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.760]   We want to empower the local churches so that one day we don't actually need to exist.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.840]   Because only the church can cover the four dimensions of poverty that we talked about.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.200]   Jesus designed the church to address all four sides, not just material, but spiritual, personal
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.920]   and social.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.720]   And today as we talk about Mission Sunday, again, James mentioned this, we sometimes
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.560]   compartmentalise mission as just a team of people within a church, as part of the function
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.560]   of the church.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.720]   We've got Johnny doing great evangelism, Florence and Charlotte doing incredible work with those
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.160]   who are needy.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:05.880]   But actually, missions is not part of the church, it's the other way around.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.920]   The church was born out of the mission.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:12.880]   Jesus in Matthew 28 gave the great commission and in Acts 1 the church was born.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.160]   So if we consider us a part of the local church, then we are all on mission.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.160]   Amen?
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.160]   Amen.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.360]   Okay, so I'm going to pass the time back to Pastor James.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.440]   He's going to share a little bit about Luke 6 and actually what Jesus talks about before,
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:30.240]   because Jesus himself, similarly, he didn't help people from afar.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.120]   He didn't just throw money at them.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.600]   He knelt down, he became poor to walk with them.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.560]   And James is going to shed a little bit more light into what that means.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   Thank you, James.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.560]   Thank you.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:46.960]   I love how he took us through this journey of all these different types of poverty and
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.660]   then he puts it back.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.660]   He nails it with Jesus.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.400]   And he says, "That's the answer.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   That's the answer to all of this."
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.560]   And before we leave this place and go, "You know what?
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   That's it.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.560]   We're going to go do some stuff.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.560]   Just anything.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.560]   Just go do some stuff."
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.680]   I want you to know why you're doing it.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:11.080]   Don't just do it because it's like, "Oh, yeah, these two seemingly nice guys with a
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.560]   British accent are here to kind of present to you something that sounds good and make
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.960]   you feel nice and warm."
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.960]   This isn't it.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.240]   There's something deeper.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.160]   And that's why we had Alex read that passage.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.440]   You see, Jesus in Luke 6 was doing lots of different things.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.160]   He was healing this man with a withered hand.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.400]   He was appointing the 12 apostles.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.720]   And then there's this moment where he's done all of that and the Scripture says, and then
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:41.960]   he looks up and he looks up at his disciples and he says, "Blessed are you who are poor."
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   Luke 6, verse 20.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   I think we might have the slide.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:50.920]   "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God."
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.480]   Jesus talks about the poor all the time.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.880]   As I said earlier, when he announced himself in Luke chapter 4, as he reads from Isaiah
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:03.440]   61, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me to proclaim good news to the poor, liberty to
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.240]   the captives, to bind up the brokenhearted."
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.920]   So he's always talking about the poor, but you see, he's not just making these carte
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.720]   blanche statements about a socio or economic status.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.560]   He's not.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.160]   He's talking about something else.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.520]   And then he goes through this, which is the Beatitudes as we know it.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.520]   We see this in Luke 6.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.560]   We also see this in Matthew, which is probably a more detailed summary of the Beatitudes.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.240]   What does Beatitudes mean?
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.400]   It means just blessings.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.280]   What he's doing here is he's teaching, and likely he was teaching these over and over
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.600]   again, which is why these ones that we read are merely summaries.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.320]   And he's giving these blessings out.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.320]   What is he doing?
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.640]   He's ushering the values of a different kingdom.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.000]   He's pushing this in, going, "Hey, this is what matters.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.880]   Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of heaven."
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:03.920]   Can we just pause there and recognise how radical that sounded?
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.240]   How radical that, and the Matthew version is, "Blessed are you who are poor in spirit."
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.080]   Now, I don't think it's an accident there.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.720]   I think both of them are summarising maybe different points of when Jesus shared this
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.560]   with them, but they both highlight different parts of poverty.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.240]   And what is it about the poor?
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.680]   It's not just about the financial condition.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.640]   But on the other hand, there is something about the poor where you are that economical
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:37.240]   destitution that you have, that utter desperation that you have that will push you towards the
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:42.880]   Lord, because you have no one else to rely on, because you are like trash to everyone
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.880]   else.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.520]   And I think many of us here don't have that.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.560]   Just that story that he shared, that woman, Laura, who just didn't even feel as though
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.880]   she could be in anyone else's presence.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.920]   But in some ways, Jesus had a heart for them because they got it.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.920]   They understood it.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:08.120]   There's this quote, "You don't know that Jesus is all you need until Jesus is all you have."
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.960]   And so those people, why does he talk about the poor?
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.880]   It's because they know that they don't have anyone else.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.000]   I don't know how many of us have been in that position, where we don't know where the food
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.920]   will come tomorrow.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.720]   But again, the food, the money, they are just the material things.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.180]   They are just the temporal things.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:32.600]   What Jesus is doing here is he is taking his kingdom's values and he's penetrating them
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.760]   into our very mind and saying, "There is still more."
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.200]   He is talking about a posture.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.200]   How do I know that?
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.360]   When he looks at his disciples, when he looks up and he looks at his disciples and says,
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.080]   "Blessed are you who are poor."
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.320]   We know they're not poor.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.200]   Matthew, the tax collector, was not poor.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.640]   Peter, the fisherman, was not poor.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.240]   And yet he's looking at them and saying, "But you should be."
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.840]   Because the gospel, and Tim Keller says this, "Because the gospel is only for those who
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:08.000]   are spiritually poor, but also especially for those who are actually poor."
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.080]   Let me just say that again.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:17.480]   The gospel is only for those who are spiritually poor, who recognise their need for the Lord.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:22.400]   But it's especially for those who are actually poor as well.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.400]   So where does that leave us?
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.080]   Where does that leave us?
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.920]   I guess it really makes us think, what kind of spirit do we have?
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.440]   And again, it's Keller who talks about this.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:39.800]   He's saying the thing that he warns the contemporary church the most in big cities such as this,
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.840]   is he's warning against a middle-class spirit.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.040]   Do we have a middle-class spirit?
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.240]   What's a middle-class spirit?
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:54.600]   A middle-class spirit is just thinking, "I'm entitled to certain things because I'm a good
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.880]   person, because I do good things.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.880]   So therefore I deserve to go into heaven.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.880]   Therefore I deserve peace.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.880]   Therefore I deserve health.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   Therefore I deserve success.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.880]   I deserve the partner that I deserve."
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:07.400]   And he's saying, "Don't have that spirit.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.280]   That middle-class spirit is what will destroy you.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.680]   What you do need is to be spiritually poor.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.840]   You need to be poor in spirit.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.480]   You need to humble yourself.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:23.040]   And only then, and only then will the kingdom of heaven be yours."
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:29.120]   So brothers and sisters, I finish by asking you this question.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.560]   Do you recognize that you are poor?
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.320]   Do you want to be poor?
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.880]   Would you let go of the things that you think are of value, these earthly things that in
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.480]   a moment will disappear and vanish?
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:50.840]   And would you let them go so you then are able to grab on, to be able to grasp onto
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.640]   what is eternal, what is of infinite worth?
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.680]   And those beatitudes in Luke, they carry on.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.520]   "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.680]   Blessed are those who are hungry, then you will be satisfied.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.680]   Blessed are those who are weeping, then you will laugh."
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:16.400]   Only when you recognise your need for a saviour will you then truly be satisfied from the
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.120]   hunger that you've been experiencing.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:25.760]   Only when you truly recognise the bad news that exists around the world will the weeping
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:31.080]   then turn into laughter because of what Jesus did.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:40.000]   So blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.200]   I want to spend a few minutes now just to invite you into a time of personal reflection.
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.680]   There's something about this world that, especially maybe our culture where we're like,
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.680]   "You know what?
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.880]   We need to be self-sufficient.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:59.520]   We need to show that we bring value to, we need to justify our existence to why we're
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.960]   here."
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.960]   The first thing we ask is, "What's your name and then what do you do?"
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:13.000]   But just for a moment now, just pause and just go, "Man, I need you, God.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.400]   I am so messed up inside, but I need you."
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:24.600]   And only when we get to that place, that disposition of the heart where we're saying, "Man, we
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.200]   can't do it on our own.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.180]   I fall short every single time.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:36.880]   That even my best works, even everything I do is like trash when compared to the holiness
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:44.320]   of God," and only then, and once we get there, we will then be rich.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:51.560]   And once we realize how weak we are, isn't it strange how he keeps that secret unlocked
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.640]   in this most paradoxical way almost?
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:03.600]   But only when we realize how weak we truly are is then, when we are weak, we are strong.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.960]   Let's just bow our heads now and let's close our eyes as I invite the team up.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:13.440]   I should invite you just to spend this moment now, again, not just to get yourself into
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:25.880]   a sorry state, but recognizing that even then, the purpose of reminding ourself of the sorrows
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:31.920]   is the joy that comes with trading in those sorrows so that we get to rejoice.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:37.040]   Just recognizing Romans 3 23, that we all fall short of the glory of God, and there
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:42.040]   is no doubt that we do fall short, but that verse isn't finished.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:50.240]   We all fall short of the glory of God, but we are all justified freely as a gift, as
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.720]   a gift.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   So there is no shame.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.640]   There is no embarrassment in bowing before the Lord our God now and saying, "Lord, I
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.800]   confess.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.920]   I bow down before you.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.240]   I've tried to do it on my own.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.920]   I still try to do it on my own.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.640]   Things around me are falling apart.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:17.880]   The loved ones that I have around me, their health is failing.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.040]   My business idea isn't working.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.720]   My relationship is just falling apart.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:32.040]   My future just doesn't look clear."
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.080]   And it's in that moment I truly believe the Lord is telling us, the Holy Spirit is speaking
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:42.960]   to you and saying, "You are right where you need to be."
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:48.060]   Because if only you would see what I see, that it isn't about this world, that these
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:53.400]   afflictions that you have surrounding you are light and momentary compared to the eternal
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:32:02.440]   weight of glory that awaits, child, if only you would see you as I see, if only you could
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:14.560]   see the eternity that awaits you, then even when there are troubles, you will take heart
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:19.960]   and know that He has overcome.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:31.080]   So brothers, sisters, let us own up to, let us recognize our poverty, our need for a Savior,
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:37.560]   and then rejoice knowing that He has come.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.920]   So Jesus, we come before you now.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.800]   We bow at your feet.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.900]   We say that we need you.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.280]   This world is so hard to make sense of.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:58.080]   We keep messing up each time too.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:05.960]   But would you help us up again?
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.600]   Would you give us the strength to stand?
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:16.280]   And then would you grant us compassion so that it doesn't just leave us here, but that
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:22.740]   compassion would then lead to action as we leave this room, as we visit the desks and
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:31.160]   hear about the missions for youth, for human, anti-human trafficking.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.960]   That compassion that you instill in us would then spur us on into action, but we know that
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:41.920]   compassion only comes when we recognize the compassion you have for us.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:49.200]   Lord, we need you every hour, every moment of every day.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.080]   Amen.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
