00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
(字幕: 李卓人)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,440
我們今天的主題是

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,240
"主宰靈性的宇宙"

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,240
主宰靈性的宇宙

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,440
我們今年開始讀哪本書呢?

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,160
知道嗎?

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,160
Mark的書

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,760
如同你所見的下一個頁

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,640
Mark的書

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,640
我們學習了很多東西

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,320
耶穌主宰了靈性的宇宙

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,880
祂可以治癒病人

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,880
可以把人變成石頭和麵包

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
祂可以給予五千人

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,880
祂也是聖誕老人

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,880
上週我們學到耶穌是聖誕老人

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,880
今天我們要學到

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,880
耶穌是主宰靈性的宇宙

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,880
主宰靈性的宇宙

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,880
我們一起讀Mark 4

21
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
一起讀

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,880
1,2,3

23
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,880
(翻譯)

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,880
(翻譯)

25
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:30,880
(看著畫面)

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:52,880
(看著畫面)

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,880
耶穌去了新的地區

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,880
(看著畫面)

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,880
很多人想祂被治癒

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,880
有些人有不潔的靈魂

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,880
我們知道聖靈有聖靈

32
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,880
但也有不潔的靈魂

33
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,880
不潔的靈魂跟祂說

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,880
You are the son of God

35
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,880
不潔的靈魂知道耶穌是誰

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,880
我問你們

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Do you believe in the spiritual realm?

38
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,880
That there is unclean spirits

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,880
That there is demons, angels

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,880
誰覺得有靈魂的?

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,880
因為有靈魂的

42
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,880
這些女孩沒想過

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,880
只有有靈魂的

44
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,880
(看著畫面)

45
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
(看著畫面)

46
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
聖經說

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:22,880
(看著畫面)

48
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,880
聖經很清楚說

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,880
是有靈魂的

50
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
(看著畫面)

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,880
下一個畫面是一個回答機

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,880
有一次我小時候在彈琴

53
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,880
(彈琴)

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,880
有個回答機

55
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,880
誰以前有個回答機?

56
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Mentors應該有吧

57
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,880
有人打來

58
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,880
你不聽電話

59
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,880
就自動錄音回答

60
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Message

61
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,880
我彈琴的時候

62
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,880
我小時候像你們一樣

63
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,880
有個Message是這樣的

64
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,880
黃牧師

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,880
為什麼你不聽電話?

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,880
我像你們這個年紀

67
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,880
你覺得你的反應會怎樣?

68
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,880
這個人有什麼問題?

69
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,880
我爸爸回來的時候

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,880
我爸爸是牧師

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
他就解釋了

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Johnny你還好嗎?

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
因為這個回答機

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
是我幫這個人

75
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,880
做Exorcism

76
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,880
Exorcism

77
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
所以那是我第一次

78
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,880
遇到靈魂的世界

79
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
我就覺得

80
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,880
哇!這些東西真的存在

81
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
那我就問你

82
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,880
你有沒有遇到靈魂的世界?

83
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,880
你有看過一些東西嗎?

84
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,880
它們可以是天使

85
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
可以是魔鬼

86
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,880
它們存在

87
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,880
撒旦、魔鬼

88
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
我問一下你們

89
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,880
你覺得是從哪裡來的?

90
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,880
這些魔鬼、不潔的靈魂

91
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
它們從哪裡來的?

92
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
有沒有人知道?

93
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,880
它們是人類的嗎?

94
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
你覺得它們是人類的嗎?

95
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
還有誰知道?

96
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
它們是從哪裡來的?

97
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,880
它們是從哪裡來的?

98
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
有沒有人知道?

99
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
這三個人是誰來的?

100
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
知道嗎?

101
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,880
這三個人是誰來的?

102
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
有人知道嗎?

103
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
這個是

104
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
神創造

105
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,880
三頭天使

106
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
三頭天使

107
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
它們的名字是甚麼?

108
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,880
有沒有人知道?

109
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
M字頭的

110
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Michael

111
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
有沒有人知道?

112
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
是Michael的

113
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,880
第一頭天使的名字是Michael

114
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
第二是G字頭的

115
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
有沒有人知道?

116
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Gabriel

117
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
第三是甚麼名字?

118
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,880
是甚麼?

119
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,880
L字頭的

120
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
Lucifer

121
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
三頭天使

122
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Michael

123
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Gabriel

124
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Lucifer

125
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
但是Lucifer

126
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
發生了甚麼事?

127
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,880
為甚麼神創造了他

128
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
是一個天使

129
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
發生了甚麼事?

130
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,880
我們看Isaiah 14

131
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
我們一起讀

132
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
準備,1,2,3

133
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
(英文)

134
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
(英文)

135
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
(英文)

136
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
(英文)

137
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Lucifer,神創造了他

138
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
是怎樣的?

139
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,880
是一個Morning Star

140
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
這裡寫

141
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Old Day Star

142
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
很漂亮的

143
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
他是一個Beautiful

144
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
其實我不用戴口罩

145
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,880
他是一個Beautiful Morning Star

146
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
但是他怎樣?

147
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
他就怎樣?

148
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
他覺得他自己怎樣?

149
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
他就開始驕傲

150
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
驕傲呢?

151
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Pride

152
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
他覺得他自己很漂亮

153
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
很偉大

154
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,880
I will make myself like the most high

155
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,880
他覺得自己可以像神一樣

156
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,880
This angel had pride

157
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
And what happened to him?

158
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
結果是甚麼?

159
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Not death

160
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,880
He was fallen

161
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,880
God threw him down to the earth

162
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
To Shiloh

163
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,880
To the far reaches of the pit

164
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,880
我們看到

165
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
這個是The beginning

166
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,880
The start of Satan

167
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,880
和他的Legions

168
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
His followers

169
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
The angels that followed Lucifer

170
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,880
What happened to them?

171
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,880
They were all thrown towards the earth

172
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,880
這些魔鬼有甚麼能力?

173
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
他們可以做甚麼?

174
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
有沒有人記得?

175
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
這些魔鬼可以做甚麼?

176
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,880
首先他們可以擁有人

177
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
他們可以擁有人

178
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,880
如果人們給他們控制

179
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
他們可以擁有他們

180
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,880
並且鼓勵他們

181
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,880
並且造成他們的身體和靈性傷害

182
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
他們可以使他們做惡

183
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
我們可以看到

184
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
在整個福音書中

185
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
當魔鬼擁有他們

186
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,880
他們有超自然的能力

187
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
我沒有見過

188
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
但我聽說有些朋友

189
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,880
見過有人擁有魔鬼時

190
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,880
他有超自然的能力

191
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,880
超自然的能力

192
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
魔鬼可以做甚麼?

193
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,880
他可以盯著我們的心

194
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,880
保護我們從真相中

195
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,880
他們可以欺騙人

196
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
欺騙人

197
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,880
以為他們是正義的

198
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
就像反對耶穌基督

199
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,880
他可以欺騙人

200
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,880
推動謊言

201
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
魔鬼可以推動謊言

202
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
他們可以造成證據

203
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,880
來欺騙人

204
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
這些魔鬼是有能力的

205
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
這些不潔的靈魂

206
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
是有能力的

207
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,880
他們有能力

208
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
我們繼續讀

209
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
馬克四書

210
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
我們繼續讀

211
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
馬克四書

212
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
跟著我讀

213
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
準備

214
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
我們一二三

215
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,880
(文章繼續)

216
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,880
(文章繼續)

217
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
(文章繼續)

218
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,880
(文章繼續)

219
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
(文章繼續)

220
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
(文章結束)

221
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
首先

222
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,880
這些寫信徒是誰來的?

223
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
這些寫信徒是

224
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,880
法律的老師

225
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
寫信徒

226
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
他們很認識

227
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
舊約

228
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
他們認識

229
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
和真正了解

230
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
舊約

231
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
他們就下來

232
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
他們就上去

233
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Galilee

234
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
上去怎樣?

235
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
指責耶穌

236
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
是甚麼?

237
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
是謊言

238
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,880
指責耶穌是謊言

239
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,880
寫信徒指責耶穌的兩件事

240
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
第一件事

241
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,880
是耶穌自己

242
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,880
是被波茲巴擁有

243
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
第二件事

244
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
是耶穌有能力

245
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
耶穌為甚麼有能力

246
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
去驅散這些靈魂?

247
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,880
因為祂

248
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
是

249
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
給予靈魂權力

250
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,880
由魔鬼主子

251
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
即是是神自己

252
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,880
波茲巴是誰來的?

253
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
波茲巴

254
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
下一頁

255
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
是誰來的?

256
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
是巴爾

257
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,880
是古代的

258
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
堅尼亞人的神

259
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880
如果在舊約讀

260
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,880
那些是

261
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
神

262
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
在人們的名義上

263
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
為巴爾的神

264
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
而祈禱

265
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
也是一個名字

266
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
給神的

267
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
也是一個名字

268
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
給神的

269
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
那麼

270
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
這些徒弟就說

271
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,880
耶穌為甚麼可以驅散這些靈魂?

272
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
因為祂自己

273
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
是

274
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,880
被魔鬼主子權力

275
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
祂自己是被魔鬼主子權力

276
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
耶穌就說

277
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
這怎麼可能?

278
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
一個分裂的房子

279
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
不可能站起來

280
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
一個分裂的房子

281
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,880
不可能站起來

282
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,880
好像國際戰爭一樣

283
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
有沒有人看過國際戰爭?

284
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
冒險者

285
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,880
有國際戰爭的時候

286
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
他們是不是

287
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
可以對抗不公平?

288
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
對抗敵人?

289
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
可以嗎?

290
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
他們不能對抗

291
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,880
因為他們在對抗自己

292
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
誰是?

293
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
鐵甲人隊的

294
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
舉起你的手

295
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
鐵甲人隊

296
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
全部是美國隊長

297
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
美國隊長

298
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
國際戰爭發生的時候

299
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,880
他們是不是在對抗敵人?

300
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
其實不是

301
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
他們在對抗自己

302
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
耶穌就這樣說

303
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
我怎麼可以

304
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
被魔鬼主子權力

305
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
對抗魔鬼?

306
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
魔鬼主子權力對抗魔鬼?

307
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
一個分裂的房子

308
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
對抗自己

309
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
不可能站起來

310
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,880
不可能站起來

311
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
所以耶穌

312
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
就說什麼?

313
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
下一頁

314
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
寫信的爭論

315
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
很有趣

316
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
這應該是耶穌

317
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
對抗寫信

318
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
寫信不合理

319
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
耶穌

320
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
就是合理

321
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,880
這是我們第一點

322
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
第一個比較

323
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
我們繼續讀

324
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
我們繼續讀

325
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,880
馬克四書

326
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
我們一起讀

327
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
1,2,3

328
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,880
沒有人可以進入強人的家

329
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
並盜竊他的財物

330
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,880
除非他首先對抗強人

331
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,880
然後他就能盜竊他的家

332
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
這個形容

333
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
是有一個

334
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
很大隻

335
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
很強的一個人

336
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
在他的家

337
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
如果你想打劫他

338
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
OK

339
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
你想打劫他

340
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
你要怎樣?

341
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,880
你要先對抗強人

342
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
誰覺得他是強人?

343
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
誰覺得他是強人?

344
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
誰覺得他是強人?

345
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
Caleb?

346
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Mark?

347
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
CY?

348
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
你覺得你是強人?

349
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
OK,弱人

350
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,880
開玩笑

351
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
這個形容

352
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
這個故事

353
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
耶穌說的這個故事

354
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
你覺得強人是誰?

355
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
強人是誰?

356
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,880
誰覺得強人是耶穌?

357
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,880
舉手

358
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,880
誰覺得強人在這個故事

359
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
是Satan?

360
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,880
沒有人知道?

361
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
再問一次

362
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Jesus 還是Satan?

363
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
強人

364
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,880
誰覺得強人是耶穌?

365
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
舉手

366
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
OK,有人覺得

367
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,880
誰覺得強人是Satan?

368
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,880
舉手

369
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
OK

370
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
其實呢

371
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
在這個故事

372
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,880
強人是誰?

373
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,880
是誰?你覺得

374
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,880
是我?

375
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,880
其實是Satan

376
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
OK

377
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
Satan

378
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
Satan的家是什麼?

379
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Satan的家在哪裡?

380
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
在地球

381
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
OK

382
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,880
他就是地球的主人

383
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,880
OK

384
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,880
所以Satan是強人

385
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
他的家就是地球

386
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
OK

387
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,880
他被地球壓下來

388
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
OK

389
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,880
那麼耶穌是誰?

390
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,880
耶穌是強人的一方

391
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
你會看到下一頁

392
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,880
強人的一方

393
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,880
然後他會大力地打破家

394
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,880
我們看到兩個比較

395
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
第一

396
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
他就說

397
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,880
他更強

398
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Satan更強

399
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
他更有力量

400
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,880
撒旦是有能力的

401
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
但是耶穌更強

402
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Jesus更強

403
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,880
他可以強人

404
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
第二

405
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,880
Satan擁有地球

406
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
但是耶穌呢

407
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
One day

408
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
He has all authority

409
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,880
And he will take back

410
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
What is his own

411
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,880
Jesus is stronger

412
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Jesus has all authority

413
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,880
And he will plunder

414
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
我們看Revelation 20

415
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,880
One day Satan will be defeated once and for all

416
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,880
And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur

417
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Where the beast and the false prophet has been thrown

418
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
False prophet is the

419
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Antichrist

420
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,880
They will be tormented day and night forever and ever

421
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
有一天

422
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,880
耶穌會Fully defeat Satan

423
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,880
Fully defeat Satan

424
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
So

425
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,880
We see that Jesus is stronger than Satan

426
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Jesus has all authority

427
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,880
And one day he will take back what is his

428
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,880
And he will make a new heaven and a new earth

429
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,880
There is a last part of this scripture that we need to see

430
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,880
我們繼續讀Mark chapter 4

431
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
我們一起讀

432
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
1,2,3

433
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
I say to you

434
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
All sins will be forgiven

435
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Of the children of man

436
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,880
And whatever blasphemes they utter

437
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,880
But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit

438
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
Never has forgiveness

439
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,880
But is guilty of eternal sin

440
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
For what they were saying

441
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,880
He has an unclean spirit

442
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
為什麼

443
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,880
耶穌說什麼

444
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,880
If you blaspheme against the Holy Spirit

445
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,880
You will not be forgiven

446
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
為什麼

447
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
為什麼

448
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,880
The scribes

449
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
What Jesus was saying here

450
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Is the scribes they knew who Jesus was

451
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,880
They knew Jesus was a man of God

452
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Yet in their heart

453
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Instead of agreeing

454
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,880
That Jesus was a man of God

455
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
They chose to say that

456
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
The Holy Spirit was a liar

457
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
The Holy Spirit is lying

458
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,880
And saying that he has an unclean spirit

459
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,880
So they are speaking against the Holy Spirit

460
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,880
And that is an unforgivable thing

461
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
He is saying

462
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,880
The scribes were saying that the Holy Spirit is wrong

463
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,880
The scribes themselves

464
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Had possibly had a feeling

465
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
That this is not an unclean spirit

466
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,880
This is a man of God

467
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,880
And yet they chose to say that the Holy Spirit is lying

468
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
And when we do that

469
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,880
It is an unforgivable thing

470
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,880
So the last comparison is this

471
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
The scribes were not logical

472
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,880
And Jesus is logical

473
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,880
The scribes were not truthful

474
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
But Jesus is

475
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Jesus is the truth

476
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,880
The scribes were not logical

477
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,880
They tried to defeat Jesus

478
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Using their non-logic

479
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,880
They tried to cast Jesus as a demon

480
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,880
When in fact he is the Lord of Lords

481
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,880
So finally we see this

482
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Firstly, in terms of spiritual knowledge

483
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Jesus is greater than the scribes

484
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,880
He is logical and he is truthful

485
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,880
In terms of spiritual power

486
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Jesus is greater than Satan

487
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
He is stronger and he is more powerful

488
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
And he has all authority

489
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,880
And one day he will make a new heaven

490
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
And a new earth

491
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
So that is why in conclusion

492
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Jesus is Lord over the spiritual realm

493
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Lord over the spiritual realm

494
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
So what should our response be?

495
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,880
What should our response be?

496
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
Knowing about these demons

497
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,880
The first thing is to beware

498
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Beware of what?

499
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,880
That there is a spiritual realm

500
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Demons do exist

501
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Satan is real

502
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
They are powerful

503
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
We should beware

504
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,880
Understand that there is a spiritual realm

505
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,880
The second thing we need to do

506
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Is to believe

507
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
What do we need to believe?

508
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,880
We need to believe that Jesus is Lord over all things

509
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
He is stronger

510
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,880
He has all authority

511
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,880
One day he will make everything new

512
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,880
He will judge the earth

513
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,880
He will throw Satan and the Antichrist into hell

514
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,880
And they will be punished forever and ever

515
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,880
So, first, we should beware

516
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Second, we should believe

517
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:42,880
The third thing is we need to be equipped

518
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,880
How do we defend ourselves?

519
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
How do we defend ourselves?

520
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,880
We have been given the truth, the Bible

521
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
We need to know the truth

522
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,880
The Bible teaches us to know Jesus, to know God

523
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,880
To know what the truth is

524
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,880
Do not be deceived by Satan

525
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
He has power

526
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
He can deceive us

527
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,880
So we encourage you to be spiritual

528
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,880
To know Jesus, to read the Bible

529
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Prepare ourselves, know the truth

530
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,880
Have the armor of God, the belt of truth

531
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,880
And then also, we need to rely on the Holy Spirit

532
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,880
To help us discern what is right and wrong

533
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
我們依賴聖靈

534
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,880
To help us know what is right and wrong

535
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
What is from God

536
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,880
What is from the enemy

537
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,880
We need to rely on the Holy Spirit

538
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,880
And how also can we be equipped?

539
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,880
By coming to our church, our community

540
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,880
God has given us this body of Christ

541
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,880
That we can help and prepare each other

542
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,880
When we have Jesus

543
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
As the next slide says

544
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,880
When we have Jesus, we have no fear

545
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Because Jesus is Lord over the spiritual realm

546
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Jesus is Lord over the spiritual realm
