[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   - Can everyone hear me all right?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   Good evening, church.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.400]   It's so good to see you all, and I'm really excited to be with you tonight.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.660]   And it's a real privilege to share the second part of our sermon series on women in the
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.880]   Old Testament, because tonight we'll be talking about a woman who was full of laughter.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.560]   And no, don't worry, Bonnie, we're not talking about you.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.760]   We're talking about Sarah in the book of Genesis.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.040]   Sarah's story is such an important part of the biblical story.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.720]   We see that from her, from God's blessing of her, she becomes #MotherOfNations, and
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.000]   from her comes the nation of Israel, and of course, our Lord Jesus himself.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.240]   And as I read her story and meditated and prayed over it, I was deeply encouraged by
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.000]   what the Lord showed me.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.360]   You see, she was far from a perfect woman.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.840]   She made a lot of questionable decisions.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.640]   Her faith really wavered at times, but God was faithful to her.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.120]   And church, if there's one thing I want you to hear tonight, it's this, that when we are
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.280]   faithless, God is still faithful.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.240]   And my prayer is that you would see that tonight from Sarah's story.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.640]   There's so much to cover in the chapters in Genesis, so I've decided to break it up into
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.640]   five parts.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.400]   First, we'll look at Sarah's world.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.360]   Then we'll look at Sarah's plan.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.660]   Then we'll look at Sarah's blessing, Sarah's doubts, and lastly, Sarah's joy.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.840]   So firstly, Sarah's world.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.000]   What was Sarah's world like?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.920]   I just want us to get a sense of where she sits along the big picture of the Bible.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.240]   Well, we read in Genesis 9, this is the era following God's flood of judgment, and God
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.800]   is speaking to Noah, and God gives him a commission saying, "Be fruitful and multiply."
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.480]   And this clearly echoes the commission that was given to Adam and Eve at the beginning
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.480]   of the Bible.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.840]   Pastor John spoke to that about us briefly last week.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.260]   So Noah has this commission, and then immediately we see, unfortunately, how sin corrupts humanity's
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.000]   ability to fulfill the commission that's being given by God, to go and be fruitful and multiply.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.960]   They gather, yes, in one place, the land of Shinar, but then they say, "Let us build a
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.240]   tower as high as possible and make a name for ourselves."
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.040]   So God decides to confuse their languages and scatter them all throughout the earth.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.280]   And this is the world that Sarah and her husband, Abram, at the time, live in.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.600]   They're a nomad family.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.480]   They're solitary, wandering individuals looking for a home.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.760]   And at this point, the reader is left asking, "Where is God's blessing in the midst of this
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.280]   sorry situation?
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.840]   What happened to his promise, his call for humanity to go and to be fruitful and to multiply?
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.360]   Who are God's people?"
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.640]   But then we see, moving on quickly, to Genesis 12, where God calls Abram, and he gives him
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.160]   a covenant blessing.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.640]   He promises that from Abram will become a great nation, that his offspring will be as
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.080]   countless as the stars.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.800]   And God's promise immediately creates tension in the story.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.900]   How is this promise going to be fulfilled?
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.160]   Because we see in Genesis 11, Sarah comes in at this point.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.880]   We know that Sarah, Abraham's wife, is a barren woman, unable to have children.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.800]   Now a quick brief note here.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.280]   You see that she's named Sarai at this point, but her name changes later, and we'll get
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.280]   to that.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.520]   But just for the sake of consistency, I will use Sarah throughout, just to avoid confusing
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.520]   myself as well.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.960]   Well, we see God gives this promise to Abraham and Sarah.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.440]   But there's immediately this uncomfortable disconnect between God's promise and Sarah's
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.720]   reality.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.240]   God's promise that from Abraham will become a great nation, but his wife is barren, unable
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.000]   to have children.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.120]   And I wondered, what would it have been like to be in her shoes?
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.160]   I came across this interesting article by Harvard Medical School looking at the psychological
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.040]   impact of infertility on women.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.800]   Let me just read off these findings for you.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   One study of 200 couples seen consecutively at a fertility clinic found that 50% of the
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.920]   women there said that infertility was the most upsetting experience of their lives.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.600]   And secondly, individuals who learn they are infertile often experience shock, grief, depression,
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.120]   anger, and frustration, as well as loss of self-esteem, self-confidence, and a sense
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.800]   of control over one's destiny.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.680]   And I'm sure Sarah was going through a very similar set of emotions, aren't you?
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:13.760]   She was probably going through a lot of bitterness and a deep sense of failure and shame.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.200]   And this would have been accentuated by the values of the culture at the time, which placed
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.560]   a premium on women's ability to have children.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.360]   And we see that in our own time, right?
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.400]   Isn't it amazing that tonight's talk, we didn't plan for this, lines up with Mother's Day
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.920]   tomorrow, and the blessing of our newborns in these congregations.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.080]   Shout out to baby Autumn and to baby Harper and to baby Ellie.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.040]   So we see, right, even in our own time, children are a blessing.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.380]   But Sarah, at this point in the story, seems to have been denied this blessing.
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.380]   And what does she do?
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.680]   What does she do with her pain and her shame?
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.400]   Well, let's read together Genesis 16.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.320]   Please feel free to read along with me.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.680]   Starting from verse one.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.920]   "Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.600]   She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.640]   And Sarai said to Abram, 'Behold now, the Lord has prevented me from bearing children.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.440]   Go in to my servant.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.400]   It may be that I shall obtain children by her.'
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.240]   And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.600]   So after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram's wife, took
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.320]   Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram, her husband, as a wife.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.340]   And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.280]   And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.480]   And Sarai said to Abram, 'May the wrong done to me be on you.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.060]   I gave my servant to your embrace.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.920]   And when she saw she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.600]   May the Lord judge between you and me.'
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.040]   But Abram said to Sarai, 'Behold, your servant is in your power.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.200]   Do to her as you please.'
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.640]   Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her."
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.640]   So what do we see here?
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:16.200]   Sarai is so desperate for a child that she's willing to have Abraham, her husband, sleep
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.400]   with another woman if that's what it took.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.520]   Now according to social custom of the time, this might have been an acceptable arrangement,
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.840]   but we only have to look at what happens to see that this wasn't in accordance with God's
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.280]   original design for man and woman.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   What do we see next?
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:39.220]   Well, Hagar finds out she's with child, and she looks with contempt on Sarah.
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.360]   The word contempt here implies that she looked down on Sarah and treated her as a lesser
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.300]   person now.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.700]   And Sarah finds this deeply upsetting, and she complains to Abraham, and he kind of just
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.880]   puts his hands up and refuses to get involved.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.860]   And then Sarah ends up abusing Hagar and driving her out.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:08.520]   It's a sad picture of a woman's pain leading to abuse within her family.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.720]   And my question for us, churches, is do we identify with Sarah in any way?
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:20.800]   Of course not all of us are going to have the specific experience of infertility, but
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.360]   do we identify with her, her pain, her shame?
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.760]   Maybe we really want something from God, and we feel like he's not giving it to us, at
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.200]   least in the way we want or at the time that we long for.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   I thought of a season I went through in my life where I was looking for a job.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.000]   I know some of you are going through that experience now.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.800]   And yeah, some of you know I'll be flying to the UK to start a job at a law firm there
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.480]   this summer.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.720]   I actually looked for that job for maybe three plus years, and I went through lots of ups
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:02.320]   and downs, countless disappointments and rejections at the interview stage and all of that.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:09.400]   And I struggled a lot with a sense of failure, of bitterness, and not getting what I was
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.120]   looking for.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.680]   So what is that for you, church?
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.400]   Do you identify with that?
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.920]   We see what Sarah's plans are.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.920]   What are our plans?
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.960]   Well, we see her story doesn't end there, so let's move on to Sarah's blessing.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.360]   Because I found myself asking, does this episode frustrate God's grace for Sarah?
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   No!
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.440]   In fact, he doubles down on his determination to bless her.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.920]   We see in Genesis 17, he makes a covenant with Abraham.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.300]   He promises again that he will be a father of a multitude of nations.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.240]   And how will this blessing be fulfilled?
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.720]   Through Sarah.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.280]   Let me read, I didn't make this clear last time.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.000]   I'll read it for you.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.800]   You just sit back and relax.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.920]   I'll read for us.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.480]   Okay, 17, verse 15.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.800]   Thank you, though, I really appreciate the enthusiasm.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.680]   Sit back, guys, relax.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.240]   And God said to Abraham, "As for Sarah, your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.840]   Sarah shall be her name.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.040]   I will bless her, and moreover, I will give you a son by her.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.480]   I will bless her, and she shall become nations.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.840]   Kings of people shall come from her."
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.320]   And then how does Abraham react?
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.760]   Immediately, we see, "Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said to himself,
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.560]   'Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old?
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.760]   While Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child.'
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.520]   And Abraham said to God, 'Oh, that Ishmael might live before you.'"
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   It's incredible.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.160]   I think this is one of the few instances where we see one of the Old Testament patriarchs
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:51.160]   laugh in God's presence in response to him speaking to him.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.880]   And then he says, "What about Ishmael?
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.640]   We've got a solution, right, God?
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.000]   We've come up with our own plan.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.720]   Why don't you just use this plan?"
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.960]   But God says, "No, no, Abraham, we're not doing it your way.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.480]   Let's do it my way."
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.480]   He says, verse 19, "God said, 'No, but Sarah, your wife, shall bear you a son, and you shall
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.880]   call his name Isaac.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.040]   I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.480]   him.'"
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.000]   And then we see finally, verse 20, "He blessed Ishmael as well."
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.800]   He has a lot of grace for him and for Hagar as well, but unfortunately, we don't have
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.400]   time to look at that tonight.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.880]   I was just so struck as I read this story by God's grace for Sarah.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.160]   She's totally given up on herself at this point, right?
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.640]   But God has not given up on her.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.360]   She's tried doing it her way.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.960]   And God says, "No, no, Sarah, I have a better way.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.960]   Let's do my way.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.120]   You've made some questionable choices.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.120]   You've abused Hagar.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.240]   You've driven her out.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.720]   You've acted faithlessly.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.240]   I will still bless you.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.520]   I will give you a new name."
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.880]   That new name means princess.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.760]   "From you, Sarah and Abraham, this wandering no-man family, I will make royalty."
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.880]   And isn't that the nature of God's heart for us, church?
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.240]   His blessing for us?
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.360]   If there's one thing that becomes so clear through this story, it's that God's blessing
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:29.680]   is not dependent on human performance, but she is blessed simply because of God's grace.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.480]   So she's blessed, but her faith still wavers.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.320]   Let's read on.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.800]   Sarah's doubts, Genesis 18.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.040]   Well we see here that God visits Abraham and Sarah again at the Oaks of Mamre in the form
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.400]   of three men.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.480]   I'll read verse 1 to 8 for us.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.200]   "And the Lord appeared to him by the Oaks of Mamre, and as he sat at the door of his
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:58.280]   tent in the heat of the day, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.440]   were standing in front of him.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.120]   When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.760]   and said, 'O Lord, if I had found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.'"
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:17.640]   He goes on and Abraham shows a lot of hospitality towards God.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.000]   Now let's look at verse 9.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Picture the scene here.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.120]   "They said to him, 'Where is Sarah, your wife?'
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.080]   And he said, 'She is in the tent.'"
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.840]   So God is having a conversation with Abraham and Sarah's not there.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:35.000]   She's at the tent door and she's eavesdropping in.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.160]   And then what does God say?
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.960]   "The Lord said, 'I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah,
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.200]   your wife, shall have a son.'"
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.600]   And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.760]   "Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.480]   The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.120]   So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, 'After I'm worn out and my Lord is old, shall I have
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.120]   pleasure?'"
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.200]   We saw earlier, didn't we, how Abraham laughs in response to God's word.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.400]   And for some reason, God doesn't quite address that.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.880]   We're not exactly sure why, but he chooses to address Sarah here.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.240]   Verse 13, "The Lord said to Abraham, 'Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Shall I indeed bear
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.560]   a child now that I'm old?
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.640]   Is anything too hard for the Lord?
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.600]   At the appointed time, I will return to you about this time next year, and Sarah shall
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.400]   have a son.'
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.880]   But Sarah denied it, saying, 'I did not laugh, for she was afraid.'
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.720]   He said, 'No, but you did laugh.'"
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:39.360]   Now, laughter is a very versatile and ambiguous human expression, isn't it?
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:46.440]   It could mean any number of things, from happiness and joy to bitterness to mocking.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.920]   But if we look at the context here, I think it's clear Sarah's laughter is coming from
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.920]   a darker place.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:56.800]   There was a lot of bitterness and cynicism, and she doubted God's word.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:04.120]   God's promise to her at this point, when she was so old, was just inconceivable to her.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.760]   But church, did you see how God addressed her?
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.720]   I noticed he was actually quite gentle.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.840]   He was actually quite gentle with her.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.560]   He could have said, "Sarah, how dare you doubt me?
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.480]   Do you know who I am?"
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.700]   He simply offers reassurance to her.
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.680]   He repeats his promises.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.120]   Church, these were Sarah's doubts at God's word.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.680]   What are our doubts?
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.480]   Because I think there's an encouragement here to bring them before God, to not be afraid
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.800]   to bring them before our Lord.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.680]   Yes, he is holy, but he is also gentle.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:45.800]   I've been reading a lot of Isaiah recently, and I was really struck, even as we were singing,
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:52.580]   I was reminded of this passage in chapter 6, where Isaiah sees God, and he can do nothing
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:57.620]   but fall on his face and say, "Woe is me, I'm a man of unclean lips."
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.360]   God is holy.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:05.520]   But later in Isaiah, there's a wonderful passage that says of Christ, "A bruised reed he will
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.480]   not break."
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.480]   God is gentle.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.560]   God is holy, but he is gentle.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.560]   And God comes through.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.100]   God comes through for Sarah.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.080]   My final point then, Sarah's joy.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:27.080]   Genesis 21, verse 1, "The Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did to Sarah
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.940]   as he had promised."
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:35.620]   The word visit here implies a great amount of God's attention and care upon Sarah, his
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.720]   grace towards her.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:43.660]   Verse 3, "Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him,
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.660]   Isaac.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:48.700]   And Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:49.700]   him.
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.460]   Abraham was a hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.340]   And Sarah said, 'God has made laughter for me.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.100]   Everyone who hears will laugh over me.'
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.260]   And she said, 'Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children?
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:08.300]   Yet I have born him a son in his old age.'"
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:12.660]   The theme of laughter comes up again, doesn't it?
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.900]   Sarah and Abraham's son, he's named Isaac, which means he laughs.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:22.620]   So God just has such a sense of humor as well.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:26.460]   And Sarah herself takes up the theme of laughter, right?
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.420]   She says, "God has made laughter for me.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.740]   Everyone who hears will laugh over me."
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.380]   And do you see what's happened here?
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:40.980]   Sarah once laughed because she was bitter and cynical, but now she laughs with joy when
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.460]   God comes through.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.980]   She's been taken from a laughter of bitterness to a laughter of rejoicing.
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:52.260]   And church, so it is for us and our own hearts.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.260]   He is sovereign over them.
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.580]   He redeems our hearts as well.
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:01.580]   He is able to take our laughter of bitterness and turn it to a laughter of rejoicing.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.780]   And this is how Sarah's story ends.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.500]   And I asked myself, how is she remembered?
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.540]   How is Sarah remembered?
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.140]   And she's referred to a few times in the New Testament.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:21.020]   One of those references is in Hebrews 11, verse 11, which says, "By faith Sarah herself
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:26.220]   received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.700]   faithful who had promised."
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:33.780]   That's just an incredible verse because this isn't even mentioned explicitly in the Genesis
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:38.820]   story, but we have this hint from the New Testament that at some point in her life,
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.540]   Sarah's heart changed.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.260]   She began to have faith.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:48.820]   And this is how she's remembered, for her faith, not for her mistakes, not for her sin.
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.140]   And so it is with us, church.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.700]   We are remembered for our faith.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.260]   If we come to Christ, if we repent of our sins, we are remembered for our faith and
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:04.180]   not our trespasses.
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:11.220]   So as I close, can I call the band up, please?
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:20.880]   I'll end on this verse I was reminded of from 2 Timothy 2, which says, "If we have died
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.260]   with him, we will also live with him.
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.460]   If we endure, we will also reign with him.
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:32.380]   If we deny him, he also will deny us.
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.980]   If we are faithless, he remains faithful.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:42.060]   If we are faithless, he remains faithful."
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.100]   God was faithful to Sarah even when she was not faithful to him.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:52.620]   Even when she had given up on herself, God did not give up on her.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:58.380]   And church, some of you tonight may be in a hard place.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.940]   You may be close to giving up on yourself.
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.940]   Maybe you're going through a period of spiritual dryness.
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:09.480]   Maybe you're struggling with sin in your life.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.540]   Maybe you're wrestling with a lot of anxiety.
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:22.020]   My prayer is that you would hear this, church, that he has not given up on us.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:28.980]   Thousands of years later, another king would come from Sarah's line.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.580]   As God had promised, a king would come from her descendants.
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.040]   It was Jesus Christ, God in the flesh.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.820]   Those who walked with him were not always faithful.
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:46.500]   His closest disciples abandoned him as he was about to go to the cross.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.220]   But he was faithful.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.740]   He was faithful to the end.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.780]   And he is faithful to us, church.
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.340]   Will we see that tonight?
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:03.140]   Will we see that in Christ all of God's blessings are available to us, including God's blessing
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.520]   to Abraham that he would make for himself a nation?
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:13.260]   We have been transferred from a kingdom of darkness to a kingdom of light.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.620]   So will we look to him, church, in faith?
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:23.580]   Will we find joy in his steadfast love, in his blessing that was never ours to earn?
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:39.140]   Why don't I pray and then we can sing?
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:45.540]   Lord we thank you for your faithfulness to us, even as we wander, even as we go through
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.340]   our moments of faithlessness.
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.620]   Thank you.
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.540]   Thank you for your steadfast love.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:58.980]   Give us eyes to see how good you are and faith to respond.
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.220]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:10.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
