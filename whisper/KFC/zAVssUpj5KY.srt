1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 - Thank you so much, James. - Mary.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,360
 - And I hope everyone can hear me.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,200
 It's a real honor and a privilege to speak to you tonight.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,560
 I think when people heard that Pastor John

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,380
 was gonna speak about Samson,

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,360
 I think a lot of people had the idea

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,220
 that I was gonna preach about this guy.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,160
 That's my dog, my baby boy called Samson.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,080
 And actually, although I'm not preaching about Samson,

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,440
 my dog, there is a very strong connection

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,920
 between the word tonight and my dog.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,880
 You see, about three and a half years ago,

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,640
 our previous dog, Oscar, passed away.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,200
 And our two eldest grandchildren in particular

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,500
 were very, very sad.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,280
 And what we said to them was this,

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,080
 is that we'll get a new dog, not straight away,

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,000
 but when we do, we'll allow you to come with us

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,160
 and pick the dog out.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,000
 And sure enough, about three months later,

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,520
 it was a Thursday before Easter,

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,280
 we went down to LAP,

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,760
 Lifelong Animal Protection in Tsuen Wan,

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,960
 and there were tons of dogs there, but also cats as well.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,120
 And I have to say, my eldest grandson, Ollie,

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,640
 decided he'd rather spend the whole afternoon in the cats.

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,440
 He was on the floor with the cats.

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,360
 But it soon became obvious to us,

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,120
 the dog that we had to choose,

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,400
 because he jumped on the sofa, he jumped on our laps,

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,880
 and we said, "This is the one.

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,280
 "This is the one that we're gonna have."

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,200
 And we said, "What's his name?"

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,160
 And he said, "Well, he came from a Chinese family,

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,360
 "a local family, so he has a Chinese name,

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,240
 "but we've decided to call him Kenneth."

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,640
 And I thought, "I'm not gonna call any dog of mine Kenneth."

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,600
 So actually, what we did, okay, so they said,

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,920
 "You can't take him today because he hasn't been neutered.

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,920
 "He's still a boy, and he has to go away for operation.

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,480
 "You can pick him up on Sunday."

42
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,200
 So actually, we went down there on Sunday,

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,880
 and actually, he wasn't there.

44
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,760
 And we wondered what had happened.

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,160
 He hadn't come back from the vets

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,760
 where he'd been having the operation.

47
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,200
 So we went back on Monday, and it was a rather bizarre tale.

48
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,080
 Actually, they told us that during the operation,

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,560
 he had an allergy, allergic reaction to the anesthetic,

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,960
 and had died.

51
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,400
 He died on the operating theater,

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,640
 but the vet was able to resuscitate him

53
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,640
 and bring him back to life.

54
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,120
 And by the time we picked him up on the Monday,

55
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,440
 he had really red eyes from the effect

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,280
 of this anesthetic and everything.

57
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,440
 So we wondered what to call him.

58
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,340
 And our two grandchildren said,

59
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,080
 "Why don't you call him Jesus?

60
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,600
 "I mean, he died at Easter and was raised again."

61
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,880
 Now, that seems a very good thing,

62
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,200
 but can you imagine going down the park

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,120
 and calling out for your dog, "Jesus, Jesus!"

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,320
 You know, people would really look at you.

65
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,320
 So we had a competition on social media to pick a name.

66
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,640
 And it became obvious after a while

67
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,980
 that actually the winner was going to be Samson.

68
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,880
 And then it occurred to me

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,200
 that Samson was a type of Jesus.

70
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,560
 Samson had broken chains just in the way

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,560
 that Jesus in the New Testament breaks chains for us.

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,120
 So we were very pleased to give him the name Samson.

73
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,380
 Now I need to move on.

74
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,400
 Pastor Johnny did a great job

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,980
 taking us to halftime in our story of Samson.

76
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,600
 And we take our halftime break, as it were,

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,520
 celebrating what Johnny described wonderfully

78
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,880
 as the victory at Jawbone Hill.

79
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,960
 You'll see a picture.

80
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,960
 We have a sporting expression, a game of two halves.

81
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,420
 And this is what we're going to see.

82
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:35,720
 And can I tell you, Samson doesn't come out of it very well.

83
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,840
 So much so, we describe him as the man

84
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,200
 who could resist everything but temptation.

85
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,400
 But I want to say up front

86
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,560
 that this is a story of breaking chains.

87
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,600
 And my prayer for you this afternoon,

88
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,620
 wherever you are in your Christian world,

89
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,680
 that actually as a result of hearing this word,

90
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,520
 as a result of praying,

91
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,420
 that chains will be broken in every one of our lives.

92
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,480
 We've heard the story week after week.

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,820
 The Israelites were in this cycle of sin.

94
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,920
 Instead of driving out the Canaanites like God asked them to,

95
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,920
 they would allow the Canaanites to influence them.

96
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,280
 And they ended up joining in their practices,

97
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,760
 which led to idolatry.

98
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,880
 When they got to the point where they were being oppressed,

99
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,640
 they cried out to God for a savior.

100
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,560
 And so God raised judges to deliver them once again.

101
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,540
 But not long after that deliverer died,

102
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,360
 they got involved with the Canaanites

103
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,080
 and the Philistines again,

104
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,840
 and the sin cycle started all over again.

105
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,920
 Now we find even today,

106
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,920
 many Christians find ourselves still in bondage

107
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:29,160
 to the very things that we should have gotten rid of

108
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,320
 at the very beginning of our Christian journey.

109
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,340
 And today we're gonna look at a man

110
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,560
 who had the same problem,

111
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,180
 a man named Samson.

112
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,540
 And we're gonna see that Samson is a man

113
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,540
 who became very much enslaved by his own cravings.

114
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:59,440
 You see, Johnny told us last time, he strangled a lion.

115
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,660
 But as we will see today, he couldn't strangle his lust.

116
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,820
 We saw last time he burst his ropes,

117
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,800
 but we will see today he was bound by his appetite.

118
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,800
 Again, he burned the enemy's crops,

119
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,700
 and yet he was inflamed with his desire for their women.

120
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,600
 Yes, he was strong, but he wasn't really in control.

121
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,080
 And yes, he could conquer his enemies,

122
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,140
 but sadly he couldn't conquer himself.

123
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,260
 Now, one of the things I love about the Bible

124
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,040
 is its honesty and its openness

125
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,760
 when it comes to Bible heroes.

126
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,200
 The Bible tells us about people's failings

127
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,960
 as well as their high points.

128
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,640
 And in Judges chapter 16, the very first verse

129
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,000
 is one of those verses concerning Samson.

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 It says this, "One day Samson went to Gaza

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,600
 "where he saw a prostitute.

132
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,040
 "He went in to spend the night with her."

133
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,220
 Now notice, the author of Judges tells it as it is.

134
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:42,020
 He doesn't try to cover up Samson's scandalous behavior.

135
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,020
 Whoa.

136
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,720
 Now think about what Samson is doing.

137
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,680
 He is supposed to be God's deliverer.

138
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,500
 He is supposed to be a savior of Israel.

139
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,120
 But as we are going to see,

140
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,120
 Samson sowing his seeds here now in Gaza

141
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,320
 is gonna have consequences.

142
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,920
 And his sin is going to be reaped later

143
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,680
 in his own very destruction with Delilah.

144
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,820
 In other words, my friends, sin has consequences.

145
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,020
 Let me say that again.

146
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,680
 Sin has consequences.

147
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,280
 Samson did what we nearly all do

148
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,000
 when we're deceived by sin.

149
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,840
 He put his life into categories

150
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,080
 and figured there were some categories

151
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,340
 that God cared about

152
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,700
 and some categories that God did not care about.

153
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,880
 Let's read on.

154
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,200
 Verses two and three.

155
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,200
 "The people at Gaza were told, 'Samson is here.'

156
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:17,320
 "So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him

157
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,700
 "all night at the city gate.

158
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,020
 "They made no move during the night,

159
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,460
 "saying, 'At dawn we'll kill him.'

160
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:35,380
 "But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night.

161
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:42,240
 "Then he got up and he took hold of the doors

162
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,180
 "of the city gate together with the two posts

163
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,280
 "and he tore them loose bar and all.

164
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,580
 "He lifted them on his shoulders

165
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,580
 "and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron."

166
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:07,280
 So the people of Gaza know that Samson is here.

167
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,940
 He's not trying to keep a low profile.

168
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,000
 The Philistines thought to themselves,

169
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,440
 "I know, we'll secure the city gates

170
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,960
 "and we'll lock him in."

171
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,720
 Now, what does Samson do?

172
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,280
 He lifts the gate with his enormous might

173
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,920
 and carries them to Hebron.

174
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,880
 That's 40 miles away.

175
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,080
 What?

176
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,940
 Let's pause and think about this for a moment.

177
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,160
 It is estimated that these gates

178
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,840
 may have weighed over 400 kilograms

179
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,240
 and he carried them 65 kilometers.

180
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,320
 We may wonder how Samson performed his amazing feats,

181
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,480
 but we have to remember

182
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,160
 that there are no limits to God's power.

183
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,200
 Can I say that again?

184
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,280
 There are no limits to God's power.

185
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,720
 Yes, Samson was an embarrassment

186
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,920
 and yes, he was out of control

187
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,380
 and yes, he was sinful,

188
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:40,480
 but God still used him to achieve his goal.

189
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,240
 And what was God's goal?

190
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,560
 To deliver God's people once again from their enemies.

191
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:00,800
 And remember, God doesn't create evil men,

192
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,320
 but he does use evil men to accomplish his plans.

193
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,480
 But you can see how the tension had intensified

194
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,240
 between Samson and the Philistines.

195
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,960
 He didn't help things by sleeping with their prostitutes,

196
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,020
 ripping up and carrying off their city gates

197
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,920
 and killing a thousand of them at a time

198
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,320
 using any old donkey jawbone lying around.

199
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,920
 But the Philistines found a way for revenge.

200
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,300
 When Samson, you see the picture beautifully here,

201
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,300
 Samson fell in love with a woman called Delilah.

202
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:53,640
 Look at these verses.

203
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:00,440
 The Philistines promised her a large sum

204
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,480
 if she could find out the source of Samson's strength.

205
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,480
 I want to put this into context in modern money.

206
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,440
 The sum of money that she was promised in today's terms

207
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,600
 was around 4 million Hong Kong dollars.

208
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,800
 That's a lot of money.

209
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:29,240
 And Samson continues to move from one woman to another,

210
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,920
 but this is no ordinary woman.

211
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,120
 This is Delilah.

212
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,920
 Samson fell in love with this Philistine woman

213
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,480
 and because of his openly soft spot for women,

214
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,160
 the enemy soon discovered his weakness.

215
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,520
 Delilah becomes their secret agent

216
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,280
 and her name has become synonymous

217
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,640
 even today with seduction.

218
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,720
 And she is often blamed for Satan's fall.

219
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,040
 But we have to remember the context of it all.

220
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,960
 She was merely doing her job

221
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,320
 as a loyal Philistine informant.

222
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,540
 She turned on the charm

223
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,640
 and Samson was very, very vulnerable.

224
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,160
 In Judges 16, six to 16, we won't read it all.

225
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,360
 We find Delilah pleading with Samson

226
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,800
 to reveal the secret of his strength.

227
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,440
 I mean, I thought it should have been totally obvious

228
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,520
 or at least it should have been obvious

229
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,240
 that God was the source of Satan, Samson's strength.

230
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,400
 The Philistines thought that Samson

231
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,380
 was using some kind of magic or some kind of illusion.

232
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:15,360
 And so we find Samson who is so wrapped up in love,

233
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,160
 he thinks Delilah is just teasing him.

234
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,660
 And so he playfully goes along,

235
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,220
 misleading her as though it were a big joke or something.

236
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,780
 But as someone once said,

237
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,880
 Samson was playing a game with Delilah,

238
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,540
 which turned out to be Russian roulette.

239
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,320
 And he bought the bullet.

240
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,280
 Now it's pretty obvious

241
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,080
 that Samson was infatuated with Delilah

242
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,980
 and he wasn't thinking straight.

243
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,380
 And as someone else once said,

244
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,180
 rather than break his relationship with Delilah,

245
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,000
 he allowed it to break him.

246
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,680
 I don't think that Samson really knew what love was.

247
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:21,020
 And he simply couldn't resist Delilah's allure and persuasion.

248
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,300
 And so he gives the enemy the answer

249
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,300
 they have been looking for in Judges 16, 18.

250
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,060
 And Judges 16, 19 tells us this,

251
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,660
 after putting him to sleep on her lap,

252
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,480
 she called for someone to shave off

253
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,480
 the seven braids of his hair and so began to subdue him.

254
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,260
 And his strength left him.

255
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:04,220
 My friends, he had a QB house number zero.

256
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,860
 I know 'cause I had one yesterday.

257
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:13,340
 Now it's commonly believed that it was Delilah

258
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,860
 who cut off Samson's hair,

259
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,280
 but that's not what the text or this picture says.

260
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,620
 The text clearly tells us

261
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,920
 that she called someone else to do it.

262
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:35,380
 And then we come to one of the saddest verses

263
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,460
 in the whole Bible.

264
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,660
 I wanna read it to you.

265
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:48,580
 Then she called, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you."

266
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,060
 He awoke from his sleep and thought,

267
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,980
 I'll go out as before and shake myself free.

268
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:05,060
 But he did not know that the Lord had left him.

269
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:12,380
 But he did not know that the Lord had left him.

270
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,000
 What a sad scene this is.

271
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,600
 You see, Samson lost his hair,

272
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,880
 but he lost something else even more important.

273
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,120
 He lost the presence of the Lord.

274
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,240
 The one thing which showed that Samson belonged to God

275
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,240
 was his hair and he ended up losing that.

276
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,380
 He lost the presence of the Lord.

277
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,040
 He lost his hair, but he lost the Lord's presence too.

278
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,500
 Then the Philistines seized him,

279
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,240
 gouged out his eyes and took him to Gaza.

280
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,420
 Binding him with bronze shackles,

281
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:13,100
 they set him to grinding grain in the prison,

282
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,100
 but the hair on his head began to grow again

283
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,780
 after it had been shaved.

284
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,740
 Look at this picture.

285
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:33,020
 The Philistines were now full of themselves.

286
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,540
 They capture Samson.

287
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,780
 They cruelly gouge out his eyes

288
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,180
 and they throw him into a dark cell.

289
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,500
 They put him to work grinding corn.

290
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,620
 This was tedious and degrading labor,

291
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,380
 the kind of work that only slaves would perform.

292
00:20:52,380 --> 00:21:00,540
 I believe that even though the Bible doesn't tell us this,

293
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,540
 that Samson's time in prison became a place

294
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,300
 and a time of his repentance.

295
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,740
 Because the text very quietly tells us

296
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,800
 the hair on his head began to grow again.

297
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,020
 It's almost as if the author of the judges

298
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,180
 is softly reminding us that God

299
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,200
 is not finished with Samson yet.

300
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,660
 And his hair begins to grow.

301
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,420
 Possibly his faith in God begins to grow too.

302
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:43,420
 After all, we find Samson listed

303
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,900
 in the Hebrews Hall of Faith.

304
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,220
 Check it out, Hebrews 11, 32.

305
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,680
 Samson was a man who demonstrated what faith is.

306
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,860
 And if that teaches us anything,

307
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:05,820
 it should teach us that the power of faith

308
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,300
 isn't the amount of faith we have,

309
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:16,420
 but the object of our faith, which is God.

310
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,140
 Samson was helpless.

311
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,020
 The Philistines had blinded him and he was put in chains.

312
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,620
 Samson was in chains.

313
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,480
 Now, Judges 16, 23 to 27 tells us

314
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,780
 that the Philistines threw a huge celebration

315
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,440
 at the temple of Dagon, which was their God of the grain.

316
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,820
 As they were celebrating,

317
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,260
 as they were giving credit to their pagan gods,

318
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,900
 they brought Samson out to perform for them.

319
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,580
 Now, what they didn't notice was that Samson's hair

320
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,220
 had begun to grow.

321
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,620
 The famous preacher, Charles Spurgeon, C.H. Spurgeon,

322
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,100
 asked this, "I wonder why these Philistines

323
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,740
 "did not take care to keep his hair

324
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,820
 "from growing to any length.

325
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,100
 "If cutting his hair once proved so effectual,

326
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,980
 "I wonder why they didn't send the barber in every morning

327
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,100
 "to make sure that not a hair grew

328
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,880
 "upon his scalp or his chin."

329
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,880
 And so, Samson asked to be propped up against the temple

330
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:47,280
 where he prayed to God for one last surge of strength.

331
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,040
 Let's read it.

332
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,020
 Then Samson prayed to the Lord.

333
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:58,680
 "Sovereign Lord, remember me.

334
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,080
 "Please, God.

335
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,080
 "Strengthen me just one more, one more time,

336
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,080
 "just once more, and let me, with one blow,

337
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:17,300
 "get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes."

338
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,640
 Pushing against the pillars,

339
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,740
 he literally brought the house down.

340
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,500
 Now, I wanna finish this afternoon

341
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,180
 by going down a slightly different route.

342
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:42,980
 I started off my Samson story

343
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:48,180
 by talking about the rather bizarre naming

344
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,020
 of my husky dog, Samson.

345
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:57,640
 Indeed, a number of recent Christian communicators

346
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,780
 and commentators have viewed Samson

347
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,580
 as a type of Jesus Christ,

348
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,860
 based on the similarities between Samson's story

349
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,380
 in the Old Testament and the life of Jesus

350
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,600
 in the New Testament.

351
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,620
 A word of warning, we gotta be careful

352
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,220
 not to take this analogy too far.

353
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,660
 But look at this, I've put it on your screen.

354
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,820
 (silence)

355
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,420
 Thank you, Bonnie.

356
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:35,420
 Samson and Jesus' birth were both foretold by angels

357
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:41,060
 who predicted that they would save their people.

358
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:46,900
 Samson was born to a barren woman.

359
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,440
 Jesus was born of a virgin.

360
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,060
 Samson defeated a lion.

361
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:59,140
 Jesus defeated Satan, whom one Peter describes

362
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,820
 as a roaring lion waiting for someone to devour.

363
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:09,820
 Samson's betrayal by Delilah has been compared

364
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,660
 to Jesus' betrayal by Judas Iscariot.

365
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:20,160
 Both Delilah and Judas were paid in pieces of silver

366
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,180
 for their respective deeds.

367
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,380
 Samson was blindfolded, insulted,

368
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,740
 and enslaved prior to his death.

369
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,440
 Jesus, as you know, was blindfolded, insulted,

370
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,420
 and treated as a slave prior to his crucifixion.

371
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:43,620
 And we can also compare Samson's death among the wicked

372
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:50,880
 with Christ being crucified between two fields.

373
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,220
 Two fields.

374
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,960
 Let's get back to the scene.

375
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,460
 With the temple filled with Philistine leaders

376
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,860
 and 3,000 more people on the roof,

377
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:12,220
 Samson killed many more Philistines in this one act

378
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,600
 than he had done previously.

379
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,880
 This was to be his final act,

380
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,320
 as Samson asked that he should die.

381
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:32,800
 It could be said that Samson gave his life for his people.

382
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:41,180
 I know someone else like that.

383
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:46,560
 His name is Jesus.

384
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,420
 And I know he brought the power of sin and death

385
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,860
 in my life some 40 years ago.

386
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:02,020
 He is breaking those entailing sins,

387
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,800
 those attitudes, my self-centeredness,

388
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,800
 and still is, he is not finished with me yet,

389
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,220
 and he is not finished with you yet.

390
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,220
 By the grace of God, and only by the grace of God,

391
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,780
 Samson fulfilled his calling.

392
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:32,600
 But the story of Samson ultimately points

393
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:38,460
 to the person of the ultimate chain breaker,

394
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,200
 Jesus Christ.

395
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,780
 We sing the song, don't we?

396
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,060
 We'll sing it in a minute.

397
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,860
 There is power in the name of Jesus

398
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,180
 to break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.

399
00:28:53,180 --> 00:29:00,140
 In his dying, Jesus did more than topple

400
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:05,200
 over an inanimate statue and slay his thousands.

401
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,020
 In his dying, he destroyed our death,

402
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,940
 and in his rising, he restored our life.

403
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,940
 Now, my friends, that is breaking chains.

404
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,980
 Delivered by our chain breaker

405
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,700
 from the fearsome reign of death,

406
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,100
 we are now free to walk in the light of life.

407
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,940
 But important as it is,

408
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,480
 it is not just about being free from our sins.

409
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,000
 It's not just about saying the sinner's prayer

410
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,640
 and moving from death to life.

411
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,820
 And I do recommend it.

412
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,000
 If you haven't done that,

413
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,060
 we'll give you an opportunity tonight.

414
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,080
 But that is the beginning and not the end.

415
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:03,880
 Even breaking the sins which as Christians entangle us,

416
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,000
 and that is also very important, I encourage it.

417
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,240
 It is not the end game.

418
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,940
 You see, and the point I want to make is this.

419
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:21,500
 The chains are broken for us,

420
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,780
 but I've come to tell you today,

421
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,920
 the chains are broken through us.

422
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,920
 Let me say that again.

423
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,980
 Chains are broken for us

424
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,800
 so that chains can be broken through us.

425
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,360
 God's purpose in the book of Judges,

426
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,620
 indeed the whole Old Testament,

427
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:52,420
 was to redeem Israel, to bring them back to him,

428
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,320
 to establish them as his people,

429
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,440
 to give them a new land,

430
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,300
 a new relationship through worship,

431
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,680
 to birth a new nation, a new people.

432
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,640
 And 2,000 years ago,

433
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,800
 God sent his son, Jesus Christ,

434
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,580
 to be our redeemer, our chain breaker.

435
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:23,920
 And in the year 2020,

436
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:29,720
 he sends us.

437
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,940
 He sends his church.

438
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,600
 He sends us.

439
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,060
 I want to repeat, chains are broken for us

440
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,060
 so that chains may be broken through us.

441
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:50,280
 Chains of injustice, chains of poverty.

442
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,060
 Alex shared it with us.

443
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,880
 Chains of lack of freedom.

444
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,380
 We cannot turn a blind eye.

445
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:05,340
 So what I want to do, I want to pray for us.

446
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,380
 And in that prayer,

447
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,200
 I want to pray for anyone who wants to come to Jesus,

448
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,840
 to ask Jesus to break my chains,

449
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:25,160
 to break sin, to break the power of sin.

450
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,220
 And that's what happens when we pass from death to life.

451
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,160
 That's what happens when we put our trust in Jesus.

452
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,700
 And if you've not done that, do so this evening.

453
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,640
 Have those chains broken.

454
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,640
 But secondly, I want to pray that God would set us free.

455
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,540
 And I believe we're all in this position.

456
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,840
 Set us free from entangling sins.

457
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:59,780
 But thirdly, I want to pray that God would use me, use us,

458
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,720
 to break chains in others.

459
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:09,540
 The poor, the needy, the refugee,

460
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:15,820
 that we would break the chains of injustice, poverty,

461
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,300
 and lack of freedom.

462
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,820
 So I'm gonna pray now, and then Kelly's gonna come back,

463
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:30,820
 and we're gonna sing, "There is power in the name of Jesus."

464
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,940
 So break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.

465
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,780
 Let's pray.

466
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:42,320
 Father, I want to pray now for anyone who is tuning in

467
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,640
 or is watching the YouTube

468
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,920
 and who doesn't know you as Lord and Savior.

469
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,040
 And we recognize Jesus that you're the Son of God.

470
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,840
 We recognize Jesus that you died for our sins.

471
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,260
 And tonight, Lord Jesus, I confess my sins.

472
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,900
 Would you come into my life?

473
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,400
 Would you transfer me from the kingdom of death

474
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,640
 to the kingdom of life?

475
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,760
 And Lord Jesus, as I ask you to be my Lord and Savior,

476
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,240
 would you help me to live a life that pleases you?

477
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,480
 I receive you, Jesus, tonight as my Lord and Savior.

478
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,120
 And Lord, we know that all of us,

479
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,040
 100% of us on this call, 100% of us online are sinners.

480
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,820
 And it is only by the grace of God that we stand here.

481
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:37,000
 But Lord, you know it's our desire to break those things.

482
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,760
 We sin time and time again with the same thing.

483
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,400
 We keep coming back like Samson did.

484
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,320
 And it may not be the same as Samson,

485
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,720
 but it might be about something else.

486
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,240
 It might be about pride.

487
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,700
 It might be about power.

488
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,240
 It might be about money.

489
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,000
 Lord Jesus, that you would break sin in my life.

490
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 And Lord, that you would use me

491
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,680
 to break the chains in other people.

492
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,360
 Lord, that I would step out for the poor, the oppressed,

493
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,600
 the ones that are suffering injustice,

494
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,360
 that you would use me as an agent of your freedom.

495
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,360
 And I pray this in and through the mighty name of Jesus.

496
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,740
 And we all say amen as we sing this song together.

497
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,800
 you
