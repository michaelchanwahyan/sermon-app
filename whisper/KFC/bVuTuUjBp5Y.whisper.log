[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.500]   Father, we thank you.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.660]   We thank you because you are here with us.
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.780]   We thank you that you are constantly working,
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.940]   even when we don't see it or don't feel it.
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.900]   Lord, would you be here tonight and move in our hearts?
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.940]   We thank you that Pastors John and Sandra
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.100]   have arrived in London safely.
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.820]   We pray for the next few months, Lord,
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.340]   that it would be filled with you, filled with you,
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.260]   and that you would refresh them and restore them as well.
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.220]   We also remember on this day, September 11th,
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.660]   just 20 years ago, Lord, when we were reminded
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.520]   of the depravity of man, the brokenness of this world,
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.740]   the darkness that surrounds us.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.620]   And we pray, we pray, Lord, that you,
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.900]   the light of the world, will shine your light
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.340]   into the darkness and that you would give us hope
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.140]   and that you would bring hope to each and every one
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.100]   in this world.
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.680]   And it's in your name we pray, amen.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.100]   Do you remember where you were 20 years ago,
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.140]   September 11th?
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.060]   Some of you maybe were not born yet.
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.060]   Maybe, oh, I remember it well, in the womb of my mother.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.660]   I remember, I was, I guess I was 15.
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.500]   I was 15 and it was, just after school,
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.860]   for me in England, my family had travelled
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.020]   to New York the summer before.
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.940]   And I remember just coming from England.
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.020]   England, we don't really have tall towers.
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.820]   And seeing the World Trade Center was the tallest
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.380]   of them all in my eyes.
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.300]   And I just remember just completely just overwhelmed
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.660]   by just, wow, the creation of man,
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.860]   how incredible man is.
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.660]   And I remember just opposite the World Trade Center,
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.300]   there was a great department store called Century 21.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.740]   Those of you who are Americans would know that.
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.660]   Great bargain deals.
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.740]   And yeah, and then that day happened.
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.660]   I remember being at home, we'd just got home from school
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.980]   and just hearing about it.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.500]   And just going, what on earth is happening?
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.300]   And then the next day we got to school,
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.620]   I heard that one of my friends,
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.120]   his father was actually in the building.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.940]   And then, you know what?
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.420]   And this is where I feel bad.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.860]   I remember feeling like, oh my goodness,
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.340]   my friend's dad is there.
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.420]   And then I don't remember anymore.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.060]   I don't remember asking anymore.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.060]   And I can only imagine what happened to my friend's life
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.660]   at that moment, but as a young teenager,
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.460]   it just completely flew by.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.580]   And it made me question, though.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.580]   It made me question back then.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.660]   And for those of you who may be too young,
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.180]   just to give you a bit of a picture,
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.900]   it was a nightmare of a few weeks.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.100]   It was a terrible time.
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.140]   Back then, there was racism, there was terrorism,
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.300]   there was violence, there was persecution.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.600]   Yeah, it's about the same as now.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.540]   And I remember asking the question,
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.260]   and actually, it ended up not being me
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.580]   that asked it properly.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.580]   It was the great theologian, Will.i.am,
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.980]   and the Black Eyed Peas.
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.340]   They ended up penning a song in response
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.140]   to the incidents of 9/11.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.980]   And what was the song called?
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.460]   Does anyone know?
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.300]   Where is the Love?
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.460]   One of my favourite songs.
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.700]   My brother and I would use to rap it,
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.540]   and we would know all the lyrics.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.380]   In fact, I think I still remember some of the lyrics.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.100]   My favourite verse was the third verse.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.900]   I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.580]   As I'm getting older, people get colder.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.940]   Most of us only care about money-making.
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.740]   Selfishness got us following in the wrong direction.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.140]   Wrong information always shown by the media.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.180]   Negative images is the main criteria.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.460]   Kids want to act like what they see in the cinema.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.020]   Something else, something else, something else.
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.780]   Whatever happened to the values of humanity?
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.740]   Whatever happened to the fairness in equality?
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.980]   Instead of spreading love, we're spreading animosity.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.460]   Lack of understanding leading us away from unity.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.780]   That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.820]   That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down.
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.060]   That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under.
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.280]   Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   So where is the love?
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.460]   And I want to bring that up today,
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.140]   because that's the question of today.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.860]   Where is the love?
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.340]   Seemingly all those things that happened 20 years ago
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.260]   are happening right now.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.060]   And that's the question I wanted to focus on
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.980]   in the passage that Carmen so beautifully read,
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.340]   finished with this verse in verse five
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.620]   that I really wanted to focus the most on today.
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.060]   But before that, there's a question that I wanted to ask
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.020]   that builds on where is the love.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.100]   And for me, the question that has been on my heart
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.700]   these last few weeks is where is the church?
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.740]   As the world is tearing apart,
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.460]   as globalisation shrunk the world,
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.500]   but now we are almost even more distanced from each other,
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.780]   where is the church?
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.580]   What should the church be doing?
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.620]   Where are we?
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.660]   We as the church, how should we be living?
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.340]   But yet, as the world is tearing itself apart,
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.180]   I've got to say, sometimes the church
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.460]   is constantly tearing itself apart as well.
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.300]   And then I'm wondering, what good are we?
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.260]   Where is the love in the church?
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.860]   And this is where we come to the word of God
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.580]   and we humble ourselves before the word of God
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.260]   because we say, God, we don't know.
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.580]   We've tried.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.500]   We think we know.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.140]   We think we've developed wisdom,
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.260]   but the wisdom of man is still nothing
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.660]   and is still compared, is foolishness compared to God.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.220]   And then we ask ourselves, so how should we do church?
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.740]   And then I look into the word
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.500]   and I go into this book of Timothy.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.220]   This book of Timothy, which was written by Paul
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.220]   probably in the 80s, 60s.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.580]   And he wrote two letters to Timothy,
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.500]   one Timothy, two Timothy,
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.740]   and he wrote one to Titus as well.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.820]   These were his young mentees and he was writing them
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.220]   and they're called the pastoral letters,
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.500]   the pastoral epistles.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.740]   And really what one Timothy and two Timothy are about are,
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.700]   it's a church handbook.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.340]   It's a church handbook and it's telling Timothy
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.860]   how to lead the church.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.820]   What should the church look like?
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.900]   And it deals with very important topics.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.820]   Now, you won't hear Timothy preach in church that often
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.860]   because it has topics that most of us preachers
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.700]   sometimes would like to avoid.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.500]   It talks about money, it talks about sex,
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.340]   it talks about gender roles, it talks about authority.
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.980]   And yet I feel deeply on my heart
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.460]   as we ask the same question
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.060]   that Will.i.am asked 20 years ago,
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.900]   that we also need to turn it on ourselves
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.860]   and ask ourselves that question,
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.220]   where is the love?
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.460]   Where is the church?
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.180]   Where is the love in the church?
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.940]   And so we look at this book
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.580]   and we ask ourselves, God, show us,
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.900]   not just for KFCI, but for Kung Fu,
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.340]   not just for Kung Fu, but for the church of Hong Kong,
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.540]   not just for the church of Hong Kong,
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.580]   but for the church of the world.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.940]   What does the church have to say in a time like this?
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.420]   And as we go through these few months,
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.380]   we're gonna go through one and two, Timothy,
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.060]   that's my encouragement to you.
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.540]   Ask yourself that question.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.100]   Where is the church?
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.460]   And is there love in the church?
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.180]   Surely that's the one thing we should be known by.
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.980]   You look at Jesus in John 13,
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.460]   he says, I'm gonna give you a new commandment.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.700]   If you forget everything else,
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.340]   I want you to remember what?
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.620]   Love one another.
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.860]   He prays in John 17, Lord, would they just be as one?
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.700]   Would they love each other?
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.420]   It's because only when they do,
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.660]   only when they are together and in harmony,
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.460]   will the world believe in me.
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.380]   And then Jesus sums up the whole of God's command
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.820]   in Matthew 22.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.620]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind,
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.420]   and love your neighbour as yourself.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.620]   Love, love, love.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.860]   It's not just the black-eyed bees.
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.300]   It's not just the Beatles.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.340]   It's everything.
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.620]   Love is the beginning and end of everything.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.100]   And this is where we land on the verse
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.700]   that I'm gonna be focusing on today.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.980]   1 Timothy 1, verse five says this.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.500]   The aim of our charge is love,
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.020]   but issues from a pure heart,
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.940]   a good conscience, and a sincere faith.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.940]   That's it.
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.340]   You see, as we look at scripture,
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.900]   Paul's gonna tell Timothy a whole ton of stuff.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.900]   But he starts by saying, hey, as I charge,
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.140]   and he's gonna charge Timothy with a lot of things,
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.820]   not charge in the sense that Timothy's guilty
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.900]   and he's being charged, but he commands Timothy.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.420]   He charges him to uphold truth.
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.100]   He charges him to serve.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.820]   He charges him to lead.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.060]   And as he charges him with all these different things,
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.060]   he says, the aim of our charge is love,
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.500]   that issues from a pure heart,
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.500]   a good conscience, and a sincere faith.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.980]   And I wanted just to crack that open a little bit.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.860]   What does that actually mean?
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.380]   What is the aim of our charge?
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.340]   What's the point of it?
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.500]   So there's two things I wanna do this evening.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.820]   One is I wanna set the scene.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.860]   As we look into 1 and 2 Timothy, I wanna set the scene.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.700]   That's number one.
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.940]   And the second thing I wanna do is to set the goal,
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.020]   set the scene, and set the goal.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.980]   Is that good?
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.820]   Are you tracking with me?
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.260]   So from here, first of all,
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.100]   I will start with setting the scene.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.220]   Paul writes this letter to Timothy around the AD 60s.
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.020]   Let me tell you a little bit about Timothy.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.100]   Timothy was actually a fascinating person for me.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.460]   He's writing to Timothy right now,
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.620]   and Timothy is around my age, okay, 21.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.900]   Okay, oh.
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.100]   You know what, you guys didn't laugh,
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.380]   which means you may have believed it.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.340]   Wow.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.660]   Vincent, welcome back.
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:41.900]   So he's writing to Timothy, he's about in his mid-30s,
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.700]   but he met Timothy a bit earlier than that.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.500]   He met Timothy on his first missionary journey to Lystra,
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.220]   and that's probably where Timothy accepts Christ,
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.900]   and that was when he was very, very young.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.780]   And then later on, on his second journey,
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.700]   he meets Timothy again, and we see this in Acts 16.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.300]   He meets Timothy, and by then,
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.340]   Timothy's probably around 15 years old.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.700]   He's a teenager.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.820]   But Timothy is very well spoken of in the community.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.580]   And so Paul takes him under his wing around 15 and says,
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.460]   "Hey, you come with me.
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.780]   "Come with me, and I'll mentor you."
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.580]   And Timothy becomes his protege,
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.380]   and he says in the very beginning of 1 Timothy 1,
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.860]   Paul treats Timothy like his son.
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.140]   He says he's my one true son in the faith,
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.740]   the one whom I am love.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.060]   We are one mind, we are like-minded.
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.060]   That's Timothy.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.260]   Timothy was very interesting,
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.700]   'cause not only was he a young pastor of a church,
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.300]   he was also a second-generation believer,
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.100]   probably one of the first.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.540]   His parents, well, actually,
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.060]   his mother and his grandmother were of the faith.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.860]   We see this in 2 Timothy, where Paul talks to Timothy
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.860]   and says, "Hey, I know you have a very sincere faith,
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.860]   "but I first saw it in your grandmother Lois
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.420]   "and your mother Eunice."
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.060]   And so we see here that he was a second-generation believer.
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.380]   Who here is a second-generation believer?
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.780]   I am, as in, who here has parents who are believers?
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.820]   Okay, not that many of us.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.540]   So he was a second-generation believer, one of the first.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.580]   He was also bicultural,
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.100]   bicultural because his father was a Greek
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.340]   and his mother was a Jewish Christian.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.180]   So you've got this Timothy, this young man,
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.580]   who's very well-spoken, but he's young,
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.980]   and he's probably quite timid.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.020]   Paul tells him, "They don't have the spirit of timidity,
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.340]   "but of courage, of power."
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.780]   So he's probably quite a quiet guy,
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.620]   but he's very well-respected.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.740]   And so that's Timothy, and now Paul sends him,
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.660]   when he's in his mid-30s, to this church
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.380]   in this place called Ephesus.
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.980]   So now I want to tell you a little bit about Ephesus
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:33.900]   as I set the scene.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.060]   Ephesus was this major commercial hub.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.420]   Let me tell you a bit more about it.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.460]   It was full of trade.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.100]   The banking was already very established there.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.460]   Lots and lots of trade, lots of money, lots of wealth,
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.860]   lots of people, lots of businessmen.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.060]   Constantly, people would be coming through Ephesus.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.580]   And then a lot of the city's trade
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.220]   was also influenced by the temple,
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.580]   and the temple worshipped the goddess Artemis,
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.980]   who was the goddess of fertility.
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.020]   So there were some things that I can tell you about Ephesus,
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.140]   was this was a city that was ruled by money, sex, and power.
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.220]   Money, sex, and power.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.020]   And then these churches started to develop.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.940]   Paul himself stayed in Ephesus for three years
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.060]   and looked after this church.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.700]   Now, the churches there, at that time,
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.100]   they were still under persecution,
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.020]   so they were likely to be house churches.
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.420]   So they would gather in people's homes,
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.140]   maybe around 20 to 25 people.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.260]   They would gather around
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.220]   and just be in their little churches.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.460]   But here was the problem.
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.860]   As they were gathering around in these small churches,
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.340]   and with all these different people
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.420]   coming into this major commercial hub,
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.260]   all these businessmen,
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.100]   all these people of high social status
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.900]   coming into these small churches,
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.460]   there was this problem that was arising
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.060]   that the teaching was starting to deviate from the truth.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.580]   This trying to deviate from the truth,
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.980]   they were starting to question, who was Jesus?
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.980]   There were people within the church
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.460]   that were starting to teach false doctrine.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.420]   They were starting to teach,
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.180]   oh, is Jesus really who he says he is?
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.980]   Did the resurrection really happen?
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.500]   And so Paul sees this and he's like,
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.980]   okay, we need to sort this out.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.060]   So Timothy, can you go to Ephesus and can you stay there?
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.380]   And I charge you to do all these things, to be this leader.
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.020]   Now, imagine this, and I feel this,
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.700]   as a young minister in a city
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.500]   ruled by money, sex, and power,
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.260]   going into a church that probably had those things
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.700]   infiltrated into the church.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.140]   And people who were maybe very used to being listened to,
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.140]   who had positions of power in society
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.420]   were now coming into the church
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.900]   and expecting to be able to talk and to have their way.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.860]   And so this young Timothy comes in,
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.460]   needing to confront them, needing to lead the church.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.340]   The integrity of the church was in danger here.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.740]   And so that's really setting the scene.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.740]   That's who Timothy was, and he was writing to Ephesus.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.220]   Of course, you don't need me to tell you
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.100]   that actually Ephesus is very similar to where?
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:03.940]   Hong Kong.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:08.380]   And you're asking, okay, so what does this passage
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.300]   from 2000 years ago have anything to do
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.380]   with what we are living now?
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.580]   Well, as you can see, we are in the same place
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.580]   where you see the secularisation of church,
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.660]   where the way the world runs things outside
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.860]   is starting to seep into the church.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.980]   Paganism, the corporate style of running things
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.900]   is starting to seep into the body of Christ.
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.860]   And yet God asks us the same question, where are you?
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.500]   Are you representing me?
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.980]   Are you my ambassadors?
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.020]   What does the church have to say about caring for the poor?
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.060]   What is the church doing as they look after the youth,
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.180]   the disenfranchised, the ones who have no hope?
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.340]   As we deal with all these things in society,
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:54.100]   where is the church and what are we supposed to do?
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.460]   And Paul reminds us here,
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.940]   there's only one thing that we really need to think about.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.940]   The aim of our charge is love, love.
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.500]   The issues from a pure heart, good conscience
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.460]   and sincere faith.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.620]   And you might be here saying, okay, well, fine.
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.580]   All you need is love.
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.700]   Okay, fine.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.900]   What does that look like?
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:18.140]   As we do church together, as we hang out together,
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.380]   there's gonna be admin, there's gonna be logistics,
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.620]   there's gonna be all these things that we have to do.
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:26.220]   How do we love in the midst of those things?
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.660]   And there's really one question I want you to leave
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.140]   this call with this evening.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.180]   And that is, where is the love?
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.380]   Or maybe to apply it to our lives is,
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.100]   what would love have me do?
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.660]   What would love, I'm borrowing that from a pastor
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.260]   in America called Andy Stanley.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.340]   And it's a question that he would often ask himself
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.420]   whenever faced with decisions, whenever faced with needing
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.700]   to figure out what to do in a certain circumstance,
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.380]   he would ask himself this question,
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.980]   what would love have me do?
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.660]   That's the question I've been asking myself.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.980]   I'll tell you recently, Christina and I,
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.580]   we got into a really big fight, married couples,
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.300]   do we get into fights every now and again?
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.540]   Yeah, I got into a big fight.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.140]   And I remember that question popping up
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.540]   and just piercing through my heart.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.940]   See, when two people are trying to live together
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.300]   and raise kids together and work together,
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.740]   no doubt there are differences in the way that you do things
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.500]   and where you wanna put your toothbrushes
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.180]   in a different place with the other person,
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.660]   the amount of times you wanna clean the toilet,
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.780]   no, this is the whole thing.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.620]   I'm not here to just share all of my household problems
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.180]   with you right now.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:29.140]   But I remember asking myself that question.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.300]   It got to a point where it was like, you know what?
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.900]   It wasn't just what's the right thing to do.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.340]   It was what would love have me do.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.900]   And I would love for you to be able
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.220]   to leave this room today.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.500]   Having that question in your mind,
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.460]   I think everyone here probably has something
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.620]   that they have to deal with
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.100]   or something that they are dealing with
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.900]   or someone that they are dealing with.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.540]   I wanna ask you to think about that question.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.100]   What would love have me do?
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:03.340]   Now, again, it's almost an abstract concept sometimes,
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.260]   but it can be very much simplified.
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.340]   But let's call it an abstract concept for now,
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.020]   this idea of love.
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.580]   And yet Paul breaks it down.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.060]   Where do you get love from?
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.860]   It issues from a pure heart, a good conscience,
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.700]   and a sincere faith.
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.060]   And today I briefly just wanna break those three parts down
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.540]   so maybe you can leave here with a better idea
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.060]   of what love really is.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.540]   And the first one is a pure heart.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.380]   Love comes from a pure heart.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.900]   Jesus talks about this in Matthew 5:8.
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.820]   "Blessed are those who are pure in heart,
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.060]   "for they will see God."
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.580]   But when we hear that pure in heart,
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.060]   we're not talking about someone
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.620]   who's fighting successfully the temptations of lust,
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.900]   of power, it's not quite just that.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.140]   When he says, "Blessed are those who are pure in heart,"
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:52.700]   what they mean is that you are single-mindedly devoted
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.900]   to God.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.060]   He's saying that if you are single-mindedly,
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.260]   tunnel direction, devoted to God, then you will see Him.
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.700]   And your love has to be that from a pure place,
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.660]   that we are loving Him wholeheartedly.
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.380]   There is no halfway house when it comes to loving God,
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.660]   at least there should not be.
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.540]   When we love God, it has to be with all our heart,
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.020]   soul, and mind.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.100]   It has to be wholehearted.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:22.100]   The totality of your affections has to be directed to God.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.420]   Let me just stop there.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.540]   No need to raise hands, but hey,
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.340]   how many of us declare that we love God?
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.460]   We sing songs and we,
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.940]   but do we really, truly love Him?
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:42.540]   With a pure heart, single-mindedly devoted to Him?
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.380]   When we sing the songs in church,
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.300]   do we truly mean them?
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.980]   Are we giving up ourselves completely to the Lord?
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.340]   And I think sometimes, and for those of us
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.780]   who have maybe spent so much time in church,
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:03.300]   we can go through the motions so easily.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.300]   Just declare our love, but is it really a love
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.420]   that comes out of a pure heart?
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.500]   Jesus talks about this.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.700]   He says, "They might be worshipping me with their lips,
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.940]   "but their hearts are far from me.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.180]   "They may look good on the outside,
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.060]   "but inside, oh my goodness, they are so filthy.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.420]   "They are so distanced from me."
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:29.420]   Brothers and sisters, do you have a pure heart for God?
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.900]   When you say you love Him, when you sing about loving Him,
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.060]   do you truly love Him?
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.780]   Have you given Him everything?
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.900]   That's the first thing.
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.820]   Love comes from a pure heart.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:45.780]   The second one is this, a good conscience.
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.740]   A good conscience, the word conscience there in the Greek
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.540]   is synedesis, which means joint knowledge.
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.820]   It means having an awareness of right and wrong.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:59.500]   And this was happening in the church at that moment,
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.660]   where we'll talk about it in the coming weeks,
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.020]   especially when it deals with false doctrine,
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.060]   Paul was saying that there are certain people in the church,
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.540]   in the church, not outside, in the church,
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.820]   who are teaching a false gospel.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.340]   And what does he say in 1 Timothy 3, 4?
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.540]   He says, "Their consciences are seared.
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.540]   "They are liars.
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.700]   "They are liars."
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.380]   And when he talks about a leader in 1 Timothy 3,
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.100]   he's talking about a leader that needs to hold
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.900]   the mystery of the faith in good conscience,
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:35.060]   having full awareness of what's right and wrong.
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.140]   See, there were people in the church at that moment
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.660]   that were teaching, and they were basically teaching
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.540]   false truth, basically to control other people.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.060]   Some of the things, and Paul talks about this in Timothy,
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.860]   he's saying, "Some of you are forbidding people
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.700]   "to get married.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.220]   "Some of you are banning marriage.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.820]   "Some of you are banning foods.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.380]   "You're doing that because you are seeking control.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.900]   "Your consciences are seared.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.540]   "You are liars.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.740]   "You don't have this conscience where you know
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.300]   "what's right from wrong anymore."
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.460]   You may stop there and just go,
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.300]   "Well, hang on a minute.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.300]   "Conscience is a very individualistic thing.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.940]   "Hey, what's right for me is right.
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.860]   "We're in that kind of society now, right?"
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.660]   But you see, that's our own,
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.580]   maybe a lot of us might be influenced
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.380]   by the modern way of thinking,
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.500]   maybe a Western way of thinking,
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.140]   which is our conscience belongs to us,
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.620]   that everything is just, only God can judge me.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.460]   You can't judge me.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.900]   Everything is about, everything can be determined by me.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.180]   But you see, Paul wouldn't have written
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.780]   about conscience in such a way.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.980]   The Eastern mindset, and maybe for those of us
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.540]   who are more Chinese will understand this,
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.660]   when it comes to good conscience,
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.220]   when it comes to right and wrong,
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:53.220]   it is also found within the context of community.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.020]   It is also found in the context of community,
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.940]   believers together, interpreting scripture together,
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.660]   not just relying on the flesh of one person
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.700]   and then distorting it for their own good.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.540]   But within a community,
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.220]   you determine what is right and wrong.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.780]   That is how you have a good conscience
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.420]   because it affects, recognizing that what you do
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.820]   affects other people.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.140]   Maybe the Western mindset is one of guilt.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.700]   When you do something wrong, I feel guilty
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.740]   'cause I've wronged and it's all about me.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.500]   But the Eastern mindset is different.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.660]   It's about honour.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.500]   It's about shame.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.660]   When you do something wrong,
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:27.980]   yeah, you probably feel guilty,
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.460]   but you feel that shame,
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.100]   that I have brought shame on my whole family.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.100]   I can't do that because it will be frowned upon
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.140]   in my community.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.580]   And that's more of what the Apostle Paul
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.860]   would have understood it to be.
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.140]   So for us, it's important for us to gather in these places
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.500]   and to teach each other correct doctrine
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.060]   because it's here where we're able to live out the truth.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.780]   It's here where we're able to maintain that good conscience,
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.340]   that awareness of what's right and wrong.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.300]   So the question that we have to ask is,
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.180]   as we go about our way, as we make decisions,
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.980]   is our conscience clear?
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.300]   Are we glorifying God?
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.820]   And are we edifying and lifting up the body
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.900]   and building up the body of Christ?
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.020]   That's how you know you have a good conscience.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:21.020]   And only then will you have the love that God demands.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.980]   Conscience is tied in with love
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.220]   because it's about how we love each other,
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.380]   if we're just all determined by how we feel
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.860]   and we're not caring about other people,
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.180]   then is that really love?
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:39.180]   But true love is where we consider the interests of others.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:44.300]   That's how we maintain our good conscience.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.020]   And the final thing is sincere faith.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.740]   Paul talks about this,
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.220]   that some people have shipwrecked their faith.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:56.300]   This sincere faith is one that is without pretense
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.340]   or without deceit.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:01.300]   It is sincere, it is genuine.
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.220]   2 Timothy 1, he says,
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.860]   "Hey, there's this sincere faith that I see in you, Timothy,
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.260]   "and it's great, young man,
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.500]   "but I didn't see it in you first.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.940]   "I saw it in your grandmother, Lois,
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.820]   "and I saw it in your mother, Eunice,
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.220]   "and it's great and it's beautiful."
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.100]   But here's the thing about faith.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.980]   For those of you who may be a second generation believers,
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.460]   even though it's passed down to you,
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.500]   you still have to be the one that embraces it yourself.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.940]   It's only genuine when it's your own.
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.660]   You can't rely on your parents' faith.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.100]   You can't rely on the faith of the friends around you.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.420]   You cannot rely on your pastor's faith.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.660]   Your faith has to be a sincere one
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.620]   that is genuinely your own.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.020]   One of my favourite songs is "Help Me Find My Own Flame."
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.540]   'Cause I grew up, and my brother grew up in a church
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.340]   where our parents were very well-respected within the church,
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.340]   and everyone would look at us
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:57.340]   and just see us as being the good kids growing up in church.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.540]   But at some point, both of us had to decide
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.220]   that this faith, are we sincere about this faith?
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.580]   Is it a genuine faith?
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.620]   Is it an authentic one?
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.980]   Do I truly believe in God?
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:14.020]   Do I truly love Him with all my heart, soul, and mind?
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.300]   Do I truly believe what the Bible says?
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.500]   Not just because my parents tell me to believe.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.060]   Not just because it's something that I've done all my life,
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.820]   going to church.
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.540]   But do I truly believe that what happened in this book
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.500]   from Genesis to Revelation,
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.740]   do I truly believe that it existed?
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.700]   Do I truly believe that Jesus existed?
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.780]   That He really is who He says He is?
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:44.780]   Do I truly believe that He died and rose from the dead?
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.860]   That song that we sang, that it was finished on the cross.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.180]   Do I truly believe in the power of the cross?
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.220]   Not do they believe,
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:58.020]   not do I know intellectually that it happened,
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.620]   but do I truly believe it in my heart?
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:07.620]   Because when you do, you complete this trio
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.260]   that contributes to love.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:16.260]   When you have sincere faith added to a good conscience,
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.100]   added to a pure heart,
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.820]   you finally get the kind of love
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.420]   that Paul is charging Timothy with,
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.820]   that Jesus is commanding us to have.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.100]   That kind of love.
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.700]   And you might ask this question to me,
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.980]   I'm asking it all the time.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.340]   What would love have me do?
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:40.700]   How do I live the most lovingly in this circumstance,
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.940]   in this scenario at work, in this challenge in my family?
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.580]   How do I love?
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.820]   I struggle with love, with loving people.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.740]   I struggle with loving my kids, with loving my wife,
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.780]   with loving my mother,
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.140]   and definitely struggle with loving my brother.
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:05.620]   Love, do you struggle with love?
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.460]   See, the thing about love is this,
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.180]   and this is where I'll finish.
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.060]   Jesus commands us to love God and love people.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.420]   And he ties the two together.
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:21.860]   You can't love God, but not love people.
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.940]   You have to love God.
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.620]   And when you, sorry, when you love God,
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.580]   you have to love people, because that's his heart.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.740]   So you genuinely have to do it.
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.700]   And when you love people,
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.260]   that is simply an overflow of your love for God.
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.380]   So maybe I'll finish with this question.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.220]   For those of you who are struggling to love others,
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.740]   or maybe you're struggling to live out that kind of love,
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.860]   'cause it's hard, and it is,
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.700]   and the best things are never easy.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.940]   But as you think about why is it so hard to love,
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.340]   I guess the first real question is,
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.660]   do you know what love is?
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.580]   And the greatest form of love
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.860]   is when Jesus gave his life for you.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.700]   Do you truly believe that in your head
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.940]   and let it drop down into your heart?
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:17.420]   You only really appreciate Jesus' love for you
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.260]   if you really are aware that you needed saving.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.860]   Because if you're not aware
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.700]   that actually that you need rescuing,
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.180]   then you're not really that grateful
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.540]   when your rescuer comes.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.420]   So then it goes back and we rewind it back.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.580]   Do you, are you aware of your own depravity?
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:40.460]   Are you aware that you fall short of the glory of God?
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:45.860]   You are so far, far worse than you ever dared even think.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.700]   When you get to that point,
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.580]   when you realise how broken you are,
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:55.380]   that you on your own cannot do this,
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.620]   when you realise that,
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.300]   when you realise that without God,
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.300]   you are literally drowning underwater,
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.260]   then you will truly understand the love
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.100]   that God has for you,
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.900]   that he was willing to empty himself.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.180]   He was willing to come down from heaven to earth
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.460]   to come and rescue you.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.260]   So only when you truly understand how far short you fall,
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.620]   do you truly understand,
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.700]   do you truly embrace and appreciate how much you are loved.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.980]   And once you appreciate how much you are loved,
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.740]   that God would rescue you,
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.500]   that God will rescue me,
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.380]   that will then fill your heart with the kind of love
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.940]   that will allow you to love other people.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.980]   And so church, brothers and sisters,
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.420]   as we go about our way in life in this city
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.860]   that is very similar to Ephesus,
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.020]   as we meet people who are clearly struggling
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.260]   on loving each other,
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.940]   can we ask that question?
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.100]   Where is the love?
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.940]   Oh, that love is supposed to be in me.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.300]   So I am going to live out that love.
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.900]   What would love have me do?
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.020]   That is the question of the day.
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:03.180]   What would love have us do as a church?
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.100]   And we're gonna be going into some very interesting topics
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.220]   in these next few months
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.860]   about how the church should handle
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.020]   a lot of different matters.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.340]   But I never want us to stray too far
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.100]   from just focusing on those issues
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.260]   'cause Paul has said it here.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.780]   The whole point of all those charges,
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.260]   the whole point of all those commandments is love.
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.340]   And we start there.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.260]   That is the priority.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.660]   When the world is asking us,
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:27.500]   where are you, church?
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.340]   What are you doing?
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.700]   About this, about this, about this, about this.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:35.700]   We stick to what we need to remember, which is love.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.140]   That's the priority.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.580]   Did you know the word priority
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.140]   appeared in the English language
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.620]   about in the 14th century?
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.500]   And it only ever used to be singular, priority.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.180]   Because you're only really supposed
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.300]   to only have one priority.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.580]   But it was only in the 19th century
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.740]   where the English language started to evolve
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.660]   and it became priorities.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.780]   And then suddenly we have all these other things
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.220]   that are vying for our attention.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.220]   Oh, I should do this, I should do this, I should do this.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.580]   Love is the priority.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.060]   That should be the thing that fills our hearts.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.340]   That should be the thing that determines
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.820]   everything that we do.
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.340]   Love.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.980]   All you need is love.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.700]   Let's pray.
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:27.220]   So Father, as we,
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:33.020]   as we come before you and we thank you for your word,
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.820]   that you use Paul to write to Timothy.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.260]   And we pray that those charges
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:47.140]   would seep into our own life, our own church.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.300]   Lord, that we would remember,
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.620]   that we would cling on to love.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:57.020]   That you would remind us of what love really is.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:03.380]   Lord, that you would reveal to us,
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.780]   for those of us who are struggling with the pure heart,
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.580]   that our hearts are just so distracted,
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:12.220]   that we are loving so many different things.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.740]   I pray, Lord, that you would just give us the strength
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:19.740]   to be able to just love you with everything that we have.
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.540]   If all that we are,
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:28.540]   would you give us the strength to be able to love you
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.140]   with a pure heart, to search our hearts, test our thoughts,
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.500]   see if there's any offensive way in us
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.740]   and lead us on the path that is everlasting.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:41.940]   I pray that you would grant us your spirit
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:46.220]   to help us discern and grant us a good conscience.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.260]   One that would bring you honour,
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.220]   the one that would honour those around us.
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.260]   For those of us who have maybe deviated from the truth.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:00.260]   Lord, that you would bring us back to your truth.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.260]   To your love.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.060]   And finally, Lord, we bow down before you
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:11.060]   and we come before you with a sincere faith.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:17.260]   Recognising that we are far worse than we ever imagined,
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.060]   we're far more loved than we ever dared dream.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.260]   We come before you with a broken heart,
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.860]   a contrite spirit.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:29.460]   Recognising our need for you.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.260]   For you.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.660]   Our need for you, not their need for you,
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.060]   but our need for you.
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:41.060]   And we pray, Lord, that you would show us the way.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.660]   That you would show us your heart.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:51.460]   So we rest in your presence and we build our lives
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.660]   on that firm foundation that is love.
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.660]   May it not just be an abstract concept.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:04.460]   May it not just be the words in a cheesy romantic song.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:10.060]   May it be the kind of love that you showed us.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:16.660]   And may we be given opportunities to ask that question.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.460]   What would love have us do?
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.660]   Thank you, Lord.
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.860]   It's in your name we pray.
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:27.660]   Amen.
