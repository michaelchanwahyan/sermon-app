[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.360]  because he had been born to him

[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.360]  Favoritism causes envy

[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.720]  You think you're worth 20 pieces of silver
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.520]  No? Maybe gold, right?
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.520]  哈哈哈
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.720]  Not silver, gold
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.520]  OK 我們繼續讀
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.120]  The story

[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:09.920]  好
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.720]  那
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720]  Joseph
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.920]  被人賣了
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.920]  去埃及
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.920]  他去了埃及
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.520]  去了誰的家
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.320]  Potiphar
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:21.920]  Potiphar
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.320]  知不知道Potiphar做什麼的
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.120]  知不知道
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.920]  有人知道Potiphar做什麼的
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.720]  He was in charge of
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.520]  The guards, I think
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.120]  He was in charge of the Pharaoh's guards
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:35.920]  OK
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.920]  Something like that

[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.720]  Potiphar的家

[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.120]  是不是
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.920]  好像Cinderella那樣
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.320]  經常要
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.520]  做家務
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.920]  是不是很慘

[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.720]  He was the next high
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.920]  Found favor in Potiphar's eyes

[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.520]  He entrusted everything he owned
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.920]  to his care
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.320]  因為Joseph

[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.920]  Potiphar paid no attention
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.520]  to anything
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.720]  except the food
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.120]  that he ate
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.520]  神祝福了
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.520]  Joseph

[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.120]  是不是這樣問的
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:29.920]  我不知道
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:35.120]  有沒有興趣啊
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.120]  是不是

[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.120]  就想跟他
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.120]  He wanted to sleep
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.520]  She wanted to sleep with him
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.320]  Right

[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.920]  He said
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.520]  Let's go to verse 30
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.520]  Chapter 39
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.320]  The next verse
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.920]  With me in charge
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.920]  my master does not concern himself with anything in the house
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.320]  Next slide
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.720]  No one is greater in this house than I am
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.520]  My master has withheld nothing from me
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520]  except you
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.720]  because you are his wife
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.520]  How then
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.920]  could I do such a wicked thing
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.120]  and sin against God
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.920]  Joseph說
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.720]  我怎樣可以
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.120]  對神
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.120]  犯罪呢
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.720]  不單止是得罪Potiphar
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.120]  我怎樣可以
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.520]  對神
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.920]  去犯罪呢
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.920]  接著怎樣啊
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.920]  有一天
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.320]  Potiphar的老婆
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]  就說
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.120]  進來吧
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.320]  進來房間吧
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.720]  去清潔這個東西吧
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.520]  是不是
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.320]  一清潔的時候
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.320]  他就
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.920]  你跟我在這裡Lie down吧
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.520]  是不是
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.320]  Come come
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.120]  Lie down
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.120]  哈哈哈
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.920]  接著Joseph怎樣啊
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.920]  Joseph就馬上走了
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.520]  閃
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.520]  馬上閃了
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.320]  是不是
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.120]  但他留了什麼
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.120]  他留了他的
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.920]  他的cloak
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.120]  He left his cloak
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.720]  那麼
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.520]  老婆就用這個cloak
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.920]  去accuse他
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.520]  Potiphar啊
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.520]  你這個
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.520]  slave
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.320]  你請回來的這個slave
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.120]  你看看他想做什麼
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.520]  是不是
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.320]  接著他就扔了Joseph
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.120]  坐牢了
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.920]  It's funny like
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.120]  I just thought of it
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.920]  Joseph had a beautiful coat
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.920]  It was stripped
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.920]  And now somebody
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.320]  tried to take him
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.320]  and he left his coat
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.120]  What do you think it means
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.320]  Interesting
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:10.320]  OK 我們看到三樣東西
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.120]  Favoritism leads to
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.120]  Favoritism leads to
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.720]  Envy
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.720]  Right
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.720]  Self promotion leads to
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.720]  Displeasure
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.320]  第三個
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.320]  Rejection
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.320]  leads to offense
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320]  in the story
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.120]  Rejection leads to offense
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:37.520]  Potiphar's wife wrongfully accuses Joseph
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.720]  He sets him up
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.920]  and he is thrown
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.320]  in jail
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.320]  很high
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.320]  接著又很low
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.320]  很high
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.920]  接著又很low
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.120]  And when he was thrown into prison
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.320]  Once again
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.720]  他坐牢的時候
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.520]  神又祝福他
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.920]  神又祝福他
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.520]  他又
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.320]  in charge of everything
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.720]  在prison那裡
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.720]  是不是
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.720]  Warden給他
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.120]  in charge of everything
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.520]  神給他有success
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.920]  他做什麼呢
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.720]  都有success
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.920]  God
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.920]  blessed
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.920]  him
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.520]  God blessed him
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.920]  那我們這個story of Joseph
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.920]  我們學到什麼呢
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.320]  What can we learn from the story of Joseph
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.320]  第一
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.120]  是faithfulness
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.520]  Faithfulness 中文是什麼
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.720]  啊
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.320]  忠心
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.120]  對不對
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.120]  忠心對不對
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.720]  loyalty
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.720]  啊
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.720]  信實
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.720]  faithfulness
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.120]  他對誰
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.720]  他對誰是faithful
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]  第一呢
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.320]  他對他爸爸是faithful
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.720]  他是faithfully tending the flock
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.720]  faithfully taking care of the house
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.920]  他爸爸叫他找他哥
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.720]  他就去找他哥
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.120]  He's faithful to his father
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.120]  之後呢
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.120]  他被人出賣
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.920]  還有什麼呢
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.720]  He's faithful to Potiphar
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.720]  是不是
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.920]  他做到
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.120]  Potiphar
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.120]  看到他
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.520]  哇這麼聰明的這個
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.320]  我給他
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.920]  給他所有
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.520]  所有整間屋
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.720]  給他in charge
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.320]  In prison he was also
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.520]  faithful to the warden
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.320]  and most importantly
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.320]  他是faithful to God
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.120]  faithful to God
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.520]  是不是
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.920]  Potiphar's wife
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.120]  想試探他
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.120]  想跟他
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.120]  sleep with him
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.120]  他認得
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.320]  神
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.920]  是最重要的
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.120]  我不可以
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.720]  犯罪
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.120]  Do this wicked thing against God
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.920]  He was faithful
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.720]  He was faithful
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.520]  Because he was faithful
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.320]  He was blessed
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.120]  神就祝福他了
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.120]  是不是
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.520]  神祝福他
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.720]  他有很多low
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.120]  是不是
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.920]  很多low periods
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.720]  被人出賣
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.720]  但是神都protect了他
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.520]  之前的哥想殺死他
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:28.920]  是不是
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.920]  但是怎樣
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.320]  他大哥就說
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.720]  不要了
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.520]  我們就這樣丟他這個Citron
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.320]  這個well
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.520]  就行了
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.720]  God protected him
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.120]  in the most difficult times
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.920]  他被人丟了去
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.920]  Egypt
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.520]  埃及
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.320]  神又provide給他
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.520]  是不是
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.320]  他被人丟了去監獄那裡
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.520]  神都繼續去bless他
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.520]  We see God's blessing
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.520]  throughout the story of Joseph
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.120]  Because he was faithful
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.920]  faithful in every situation
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.120]  and ultimately faithful to God
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.920]  最後第三點
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.120]  next slide
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.720]  God's plan
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.520]  We know that God has a plan
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.920]  and later in the story
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.320]  We see that Joseph rises
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.120]  to become second in command in Egypt
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.320]  second in command
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.320]  Joseph 有沒有
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.320]  哇 神啊 搞錯啊
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.120]  你對我這麼差啊
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.920]  他有沒有complain on this story
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.120]  Did he complain
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.320]  He didn't complain
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.120]  Joseph 可以give up的
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.120]  He could give up
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.920]  哇 被家人 被哥出賣了
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.120]  我不做了 我不跟隨你了
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.120]  He could have given up
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.720]  He could have complained against God
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.320]  But he didn't
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.520]  In a way he knew that this dream
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.520]  was God speaking to him
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.520]  and that God had a plan
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.520]  and that God had a plan
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:21.120]  OK 我們現在邀請Kristen上來
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.320]  去講見證
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.520]  我們給點掌聲她
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:30.720]  那我是Kristen
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.720]  我今年grade 11
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.920]  就是point 5
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.920]  我從二年級開始來這個church
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.320]  So it's been some time
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.520]  Pastor Johnny想我跟大家分享一下
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.920]  我怎樣在困難當中去經歷
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.720]  其實我是一個比較喜歡自己
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.320]  go through things的一個人
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.720]  我很少會跟別人分享
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.320]  我經歷的困難
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.520]  因為我經常覺得
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.520]  as long as I do all the best
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.120]  我就可以control the end result
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.120]  and achieve到我想achieve的東西
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.120]  但是變了我經常很focus on
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.720]  我要做的東西
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.920]  and to achieve a goal
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.320]  變了我很少留一點空間
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.720]  讓我自己去rest
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.320]  and also to quiet down
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.120]  變了sadly我經常忘記了神
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.320]  那我可以share一下我的
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.320]  我過去的幾個禮拜
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.320]  那for me
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.320]  相信跟大家一樣
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.520]  都是比較tough
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.720]  and really stressful
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.520]  那for me是挺難
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.920]  and also sometimes I felt a bit sad
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.320]  因為有很多deadline
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.520]  and commitment
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.120]  and經常夾在兩件事的中間
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.920]  and that's a story for another day
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.720]  但是
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.120]  就是有complication of things
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.320]  加起來就變成這樣
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.720]  and something that troubles me the most
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.720]  就是thinking about uni
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.320]  because you know junior year
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.320]  就開始plan for university
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.520]  你想讀什麼
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.120]  and我的朋友他們全部都是
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.720]  有很大的goals
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.320]  and他們想做的東西都是
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.920]  挺high achieving的
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.920]  那他們就開始說
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.320]  他們想做的東西
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.720]  他們想take a courses
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.320]  and他們的test scores
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.120]  有多高and stuff like that
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.520]  and compared to me
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.320]  他們take a courses
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.320]  are more challenging
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.120]  because we are doing different things
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:16.920]  但是
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.520]  就是他跟我說的時候
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.320]  我可能like
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.720]  all my courses are like ok
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.320]  所以變了我經常很怕我的courses
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.720]  and the things I do
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.720]  aren't enough
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.520]  and變了我最後做了
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.920]  commit myself to a lot of different things
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.720]  which 變了我是
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.120]  stress myself too much
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.720]  然後我經常覺得
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.920]  if I'm not doing enough
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.720]  那可能我的application for
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.120]  senior year是不夠competitive
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.120]  and
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.920]  yeah
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.920]  because我take a courses
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.720]  跟其他人是不一樣
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.120]  yeah
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.520]  and 有時
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.720]  during the past weeks
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.120]  I've been doubted if I'm even fit for
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.520]  the course that I want to apply next year
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.920]  yeah 我經常覺得
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.520]  我做得不夠好
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.520]  and
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.520]  那樣東西令我是pretty sad
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.120]  因為
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.720]  我不知道我還可以做些什麼
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.520]  yeah
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.520]  if I go back now
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.720]  it's a bit too late
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.520]  because everything is pretty much set halfway
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.720]  and sadly
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.720]  despite all these difficulties
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.120]  神是我第一個turn to的人
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.720]  and 但是他都沒有忘記我
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.920]  he surrounded me with different friends
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.120]  他們會經常send me worship songs
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.520]  and bible verses給我
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.120]  and 我跟他說很多東西
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.320]  他們都不會try to
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.720]  like solve all the problem
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.520]  but instead
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.720]  他會send me
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.520]  bible verses給我
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.320]  and 是挺comforting
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:36.920]  and
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.920]  reminded me that
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.720]  I'm not going through everything alone
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.520]  and 我們更加不是defined
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.120]  把我們在人生中所做的事
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.320]  或者achieve的事
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.320]  and that
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.720]  沒有東西是太
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.720]  沒有東西是太大或太小
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.120]  給神去take care of我們
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.120]  那
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.520]  a few weeks back
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.320]  我們有一樣東西在學校
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.320]  那我們就唱了一首song
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.320]  一個worship song
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.520]  叫做come away
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.720]  and 歌詞是挺好的
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.320]  it says
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.920]  come away with me
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.520]  it's never too late
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.920]  it's not too late
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.520]  I have a plan for you
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.920]  it's gonna be wild
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.720]  it's gonna be great
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.320]  and it's gonna be full of me
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.920]  it's really comforting for me
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.520]  and
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.720]  他是
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.920]  reminded我
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.320]  that 神是儘管一切的
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.120]  and 他永遠都有一個plan for you
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.720]  and it's always gonna be best
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.920]  and 他也永遠不會在那裡等你
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.120]  to welcome you back
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.520]  no matter what happens
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.920]  所以當我們去尋求神的時候
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.720]  其實會給我們平安和comfort
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.120]  and that 他的計劃
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.520]  是遠超過我們所想和所求的
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.320]  and one thing that I found really helpful
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.720]  was to keep a prayer journal
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.320]  at that time and time
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.520]  你可能不會發覺
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.920]  為什麼那件事會發生
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.520]  我們也不會明白
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.320]  為什麼他會想你去做那件事
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.520]  或那件事為什麼會
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.720]  like
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.720]  happen
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.320]  and
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.120]  但是當你回頭去看的時候
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:57.920]  你就會看到
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.520]  神他怎樣每一步
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.120]  去
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.920]  帶領你去
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.520]  他想你去的地方
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.920]  and 他給你的計劃
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.520]  and who he wants you to be and go
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.920]  it's not like I have everything figured out
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.920]  因為我們每個人都還在學習
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.720]  怎樣去更加的
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.320]  依賴神
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.520]  and 我希望我今天的分享
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.520]  可以鼓勵大家
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.120]  as we go through things together
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.920]  and to 經歷神更多
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:23.720]  那麼
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.120]  I will end with the Bible verse
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.320]  如果你認識我的話
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.120]  這個是我
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.920]  one of the favorite Bible verses
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.920]  那就是從
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.320]  Jeremiah 29:11
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:31.920]  It says
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.120]  For I know the plans I have for you
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.320]  declares the Lord
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.920]  plans to prosper you and not to harm you
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.120]  plans to give you a hope and a future
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:47.920]  Oh thank you Kristen
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.120]  很好的見證
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.320]  看到她自己
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.920]  經歷到神
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.120]  在高低之間
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:53.920]  怎樣去
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.520]  繼續去信靠神
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.520]  那麼我們to end
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.320]  我們有一些application questions
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.120]  The first is
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.320]  Are we faithful?
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.120]  Are we faithful?
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.520]  Joseph
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.520]  有什麼
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.320]  第一
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.520]  他是做shepherd
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.720]  他是做兒子
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.720]  He was faithful
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.920]  He was faithful as a son
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.120]  He was faithful
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.320]  to the task that he was given
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.920]  When he was in Potiphar's house
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.120]  he was faithful
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.320]  to what his master had given him
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.720]  When he was in jail
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.520]  he was faithful
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.320]  Are we
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.520]  faithful?
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.720]  Are we faithful
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.520]  to God
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.120]  what He has given us?
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.320]  What has God given you?
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.720]  And are you faithful?
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.520]  What has God given you?
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.920]  Maybe it's your studies
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.920]  Maybe it's your career
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.920]  Maybe it's the friends that He has given you
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.920]  Maybe it's your son or daughter
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.520]  Maybe it's
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.920]  family
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.120]  Are you faithful?
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.920]  Are you faithful to Him?
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.120]  And are you
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.920]  faithful to God ultimately?
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.320]  Next is
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.320]  Do we want to be blessed?
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.520]  Who wants to be blessed here?
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.520]  Nobody wants to be blessed?
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.920]  Who wants to be blessed?
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.320]  How do you become blessed by God?
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.720]  Joseph, how?
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.720]  He has success in everything he does
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.120]  How can we be like this?
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.920]  How can we have the same blessing that Joseph has?
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.920]  Can we?
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.720]  Is it possible?
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.920]  Can we?
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.520]  Is it possible?
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.720]  Who thinks it's possible?
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.520]  Raise your hand
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.320]  Ok, no one thinks it's possible?
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.920]  Really?
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.720]  Really?
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.720]  Really?
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.520]  Wow
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:38:00.320]  How do we be blessed by God?
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.120]  Psalm 1 says this
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:08.120]  He who meditates on the Word of God day and night
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.720]  He is like a tree
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.320]  planted by streams of water
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.920]  which produces its fruit in season
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.120]  And whatever he does
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.120]  he prospers
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:27.320]  Psalm 1 tells us that we need to meditate and focus on the Word of God
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.920]  And then whatever we do
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.120]  that's God's promise
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.520]  that we would prosper
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.720]  How can we be blessed by God?
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.520]  The key is this
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.920]  to put him first
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.520]  In your studies
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.720]  put him first
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.920]  You want God to bless you in your studies
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.920]  put him first
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.720]  Trust in God to help you
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.520]  put him first
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.720]  You want God to bless your finances
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.920]  put him first
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.120]  Give him a portion of what you have first
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.720]  You want God to bless your relationships
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.320]  put him first in your relationship
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.320]  put him first
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.720]  And you will be blessed by God
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:23.120]  The blessing might not be what you expect
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:29.120]  It will be God's will for you
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.920]  And what he believes is best
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.320]  And the last thing is this
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.120]  Do we trust God's plan?
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.520]  我們相不相信
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.920]  神是他有自己的旨意
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.520]  就像Kristen
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.720]  她有時候高
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.320]  讀書有時候低
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.720]  她經歷高低
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.520]  你們每個人都經歷高低
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.320]  我也一樣
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.920]  但我們相信神有計劃嗎?
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.520]  之前Kristen讀了一個經文
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.120]  Jeremiah
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:06.120]  神有計劃讓我們成功
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.120]  在艱難的時刻中
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.720]  我們可能被背叛
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.520]  我們可能被放棄
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.720]  我們可能失敗
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:24.120]  我們還是相信神有計劃嗎?
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.720]  如果我們相信他
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.320]  如果我們遵守他
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.120]  如果我們信仰他
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.920]  神會帶領我們通過
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:38.120]  我之前分享了一個故事
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:42.720]  是一個弟兄
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.920]  應該賣了車給我
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.120]  但沒有買
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.920]  所以還有另一個故事
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.120]  這裡還有另一輛車
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.920]  這輛車是什麼車?
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:59.120]  是一輛Lexus IS250F Sport
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:04.920]  這個朋友是台灣人的朋友
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.120]  他也是在Waterloo讀書
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.520]  他也在Waterloo
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.120]  他讀完書
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.120]  他畢業後
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.920]  他說「Johnny,我回台灣了」
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.520]  我不知道我在說什麼
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:24.320]  「我回台灣了」
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.520]  「你想要我的車嗎?」
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.320]  我問「你想要我的車嗎?」
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.520]  「當然,我想要你的車」
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.720]  「你會賣給我嗎?」
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.320]  他跟我說的時候
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.720]  我就想起之前
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.320]  有人說要買車給我
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.320]  但之後沒有買
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.720]  但這次他賣給我了
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.320]  12月10日
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.320]  我會回到多倫多
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.320]  然後我會開我的車
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.720]  我會在2月見到你
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.120]  當我回來
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.120]  這是我告訴你
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.720]  我會離開一段時間
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.520]  但神仍然會祝福我們
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.320]  神接受
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.120]  神給
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.920]  但仍然
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.520]  祝福是神的名字
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.920]  我們一起祈禱
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.520]  當我們的慈悲團隊上來
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.320]  神父,我們感謝您對約瑟的故事
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.120]  他經歷了很多高峰
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.720]  他經歷了很多低峰
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.320]  但在他們所有的中間
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.720]  他對您是信仰的
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.520]  他對您的所有事都遵守了
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.120]  他被祝福了
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.720]  我祈求每一個人
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.920]  即使在高峰中
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.120]  有些高峰可能是很好的
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.120]  有些是很低峰
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.920]  有些是失敗的
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.720]  但我們仍然會相信您
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.720]  您會為我們祝福
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.920]  因為我們相信您對我們的計劃
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.520]  您會指導我們
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.720]  走出我們應該走的路
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.720]  祝福我們,神父
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.320]  我們在名字的名字祈禱
