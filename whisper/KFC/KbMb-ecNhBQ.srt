00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,520
 Hello everyone, good to see you all. Very, very good to see you. Hey, this is my first

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,280
 time sharing over Zoom like this as well. I think one of the things I would really look

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,520
 forward to is to be able to actually share and actually see faces rather than preaching

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,280
 into a camera or an empty hall. Now I get to see Vincent's good looking face. I only

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,920
 wish I got to see him on his sofa, but this is good enough for me. Hey Vincent, hey everyone,

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,880
 it's really good to see you all. I'm trying to try and resist the temptation to keep sliding

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,960
 through all the screens to see who's paying attention or who's not, but I want to try

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,280
 and resist that. Hey, we're going to go through Judges and it's a strange book. It's a strange

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,680
 book and I shared this last time. It's full of these pretty moronic people who God uses

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,440
 to somehow lead and deliver the Israelites. We've had some of the big names. We've had

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,240
 Deborah, we've had Gideon, Mark. Thank you so much for your sharing. It's so good to

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,400
 be able to hear from other people in our church and that's been a real encouragement to me

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,680
 and to the Pastoral team as well. We've been going through all these different Judges and

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,760
 now we come across one who maybe we haven't heard that much of and because there's a reason

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:26,400
 for it. He is a real idiot. He is just one stupid man. In fact, as we look through the

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,400
 Judges chapter 9, we'll see that there really isn't much that we can learn from him. If

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,360
 anything, we have to only learn from what he does and make sure that we don't do it

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,120
 and that is it. This guy is called Abimelech. If you want to turn with me to Judges chapter

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,640
 9, it's a very long chapter. There's 57 verses, so don't worry, I'm not going to troll us

20
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,280
 through all of this just because we have an unlimited Zoom account. What I do want to

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,480
 do is as we share this story is really ask God to really speak to us and see how we can

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,640
 apply it right now. So we've had Ahab, we've had Deborah, we've had Gideon and now we have

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,040
 Gideon's son. Gideon actually is one of the more famous Judges, I would say, and he's

24
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,000
 an interesting one, right, because he really lacked confidence and then God really assured

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,560
 him and really came through him and then God used this person who wasn't the most confident

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,640
 to end up really delivering the Israelites from the Midianites in some of these great

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,120
 battles that we've heard in the last few weeks. And Gideon himself was, most would say, a

28
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,880
 humble kind of guy. But then it is interesting because in some ways it is a false sense of

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,760
 humility that we see. In Judges chapter 8, before we're introduced to Gideon's son Abimelech,

30
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,440
 Gideon wins this big battle. He comes back and the Israelites are like, "We want you

31
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,920
 to be our king. Seriously, we want you to rule over us, Great Gideon." And Gideon's

32
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,800
 like, "Oh, no, no, no, I don't want to rule over you. But what I do want you to do is

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,840
 give me all your gold and I'm going to make a jacket out of it and it's going to look

34
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,240
 pretty cool. I want to act like a king, but I don't want the responsibilities." In some

35
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,240
 ways, yes, it's humility, but it's probably a false sense of humility. And we sense that

36
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:14,560
 even more in how he names his son. His son Abimelech means, "My father is king." So

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,120
 even though Gideon turned down kingship for the Israelites in some subtle, stealth kind

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:27,360
 of way, he still slips it in there that his son's father himself is king. And that false

39
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,000
 humility, almost that false sense of identity and where he's getting his validation from

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,600
 seeps into the next generation, seeps into what his son then does. And see, Abimelech

41
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,480
 is his son, but he's only really one of 71. Abimelech has 70 brothers and Abimelech is

42
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,600
 really just a bad egg. And I want to tell you a little bit about him. I'm going to run

43
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,760
 through the story about Abimelech from the moment he tries to become king to unfortunately

44
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,880
 the moment he dies. This is disclaimer. If you don't know about Abimelech, unfortunately,

45
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,760
 this is not breaking bad. This is not going from bad to being a good. There is no good

46
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,400
 ending to this story. It's a bad ending. Okay. So just putting that one out there. And it

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,040
 starts off with Abimelech, one of 71 sons, actually his mother was Gideon's slave. So

48
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,680
 you could say that he was an illegitimate one. Illegitimate. So he goes to his mom's

49
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,720
 town. And then from there, he goes to find his mom and all her friends and all her family.

50
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,760
 And what does he do? He starts fundraising. He starts going to all these people who know

51
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,280
 him and know his mom and say, Hey, look, do you really want to be ruled by these 70 guys?

52
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,480
 Is it even possible to be ruled by 70? Isn't it much more efficient if you just get ruled

53
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,080
 by me? If you are just ruled by me, how about you guys make me king? Seriously, I would

54
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,600
 be so much better. So clearly Abimelech is good with his words. He's know what he's doing.

55
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,640
 He's manipulative. He's scheming. He's ambitious. And so he goes to these people, he fundraise

56
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,840
 and what do they do? They give him money. People of Shechem there. Shechem is a Canaanite

57
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,520
 town actually. Remember, the Israelites were supposed to go into Canaan and drive everyone

58
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,320
 out. They did not. So then you have all these Canaanites and all these different groups

59
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,120
 of people living within this promised land. And so Shechem was a town that was full of

60
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,720
 Canaanite people and they did worship other gods. And when they heard about Abimelech's

61
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,640
 fundraising speech, they were like, yeah, sure. We'll have you rule over us. We'll give

62
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,280
 you your money. So he gets all this money and what does he do with it? He then in 9

63
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:39,280
 verse 4 says he goes out and he recruits worthless and reckless fellows. So what he does is he

64
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,600
 goes out with 70 pieces of silver, verse 4, and he hires worthless and reckless fellows

65
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:52,480
 who then follow him. Him with this band of gangsters then take all the brothers, round

66
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:59,960
 up all the 70 brothers, take them onto one stone and they kill them all apart from one.

67
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,760
 One guy manages to escape and his name is Jotham. Verse 5 says Jotham manages to escape.

68
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,120
 Abimelech having killed all his brothers and basically all the competition assumes the

69
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,000
 role of king in this small town of Shechem. It's not the whole of Israel. It's not the

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,400
 whole of Canaan. It's just a small town. He seems quite happy with himself. He has declared

71
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,400
 himself king. From there, Jotham, the brother that escapes, he hears about this and he comes

72
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,840
 back out and he tells this parable. He tells this parable to the people of Shechem and

73
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,320
 it's a parable about trees. We won't go into this today but what he's really saying is

74
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:41,240
 this. The story is, he's like, people of Shechem, have a serious think about what you're doing

75
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,800
 here as you make this person your king. You need to ask yourselves, are you doing this

76
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,560
 with the right intentions? Are you picking someone who is a good leader? Remember what

77
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,400
 my dad Gideon did for you all. How God and Gideon delivered all of us. Do you really

78
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,840
 want to act in such bad faith to appoint this guy to be your king? Have a think about this.

79
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,600
 Seriously, have a think. If you really think he's the right one, well then you've made

80
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,840
 your choice and you will go with it. He gives this little speech, this parable and then

81
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,920
 he goes into hiding. He goes into hiding for three years. Three years in hiding, all the

82
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,720
 while hearing that this half brother of his is now ruling over his town. You see, what

83
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,080
 God is doing, God is allowing time to pass. It's interesting because we're often asking,

84
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,720
 I don't know about you, we're looking around the world now and we're looking at the leaders

85
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,160
 that we have in this world and we're thinking, oh my goodness, what is happening here? What

86
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,520
 is happening here? Why is God allowing these people to be appointed as leaders? No country

87
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,720
 is being named right here, right now, but what is God doing? And then what we see then

88
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,080
 is that actually God is above it all and actually he allows certain things to happen for his

89
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,200
 reason and imagine feeling how Jotham felt at that moment. He's given this parable, he

90
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,560
 knows he's right because he knows Abimelech is in the wrong, yet God still chooses to

91
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,640
 wait three years. But after that, the divine retribution kicks in. Verse 24 is when God

92
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,800
 says after the three years, he then starts his plan of removing Abimelech. And right

93
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,440
 at the end of chapter nine, right at the very, very end, verse 57, "And God also made all

94
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,960
 the evil of the men of Shechem return on their heads and upon them came the curse of Jotham,

95
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,600
 the son of Jeroboam." Jeroboam being Gideon. And so we see here, God is in complete control,

96
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,920
 even when there are bad leaders. And this is where we almost have to remind ourselves

97
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:46,000
 of this, to have faith in God's sovereignty, that he is in complete control. Even when

98
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 we see there are certain people in this world that have been allowed to be leaders of very

99
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,080
 important countries, yet somehow God is still in control. And you see what happens after

100
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,760
 this is, how does God start this process of removing Abimelech? You carry on into chapter

101
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,200
 nine, verse 22 onwards is the downfall of Abimelech. What happens is God sends an evil

102
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,160
 spirit, allows an evil spirit to basically place a wedge between Abimelech and the people

103
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:22,080
 of Shechem. So the very people that gave Abimelech money because of an evil spirit now turn against

104
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,040
 him. They're like, "You know what? We don't really want him anymore. It's been three years,

105
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,160
 we're done with him." So what do they do? They then go and try and find another guy

106
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,720
 to dethrone him. And this guy is, verse 26, they find Gael. Unfortunately, he fails. He

107
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,620
 fails. Abimelech knows what's happening and ends up ambushing him and basically running

108
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:50,740
 him out of town. At this point, Abimelech is angry. These are the people that gave him

109
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,440
 money and supported him and made him king and they've turned against him. So what happens

110
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,440
 here is he then starts to kill these people. So he goes into his own town and basically

111
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,160
 starts to destroy the city. And all the people, they try and find refuge in this tower. They

112
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,920
 try and find refuge in this tower. They all run up into this tower, a thousand of them,

113
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,880
 to try and run away from Abimelech and to protect themselves. Abimelech ends up basically

114
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,560
 setting fire to the whole tower, causing the whole thing to be destroyed and all the people

115
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,960
 inside to be killed. So Abimelech now is on some kind of power trip. He's angry that he's

116
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,200
 been betrayed and then he goes and destroys his own town. The town that he was supposed

117
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,560
 to be king of, he has completely destroyed. Not only that, something in him switched where

118
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,820
 before he was happy to rule just this small town for three years. After destroying his

119
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,840
 own town, he decides, that's it. I'm going to go and try and capture other towns. So

120
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,880
 he then moves into a neighboring town, Bebez, to try and capture that one. And this is unprecedented

121
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,480
 for him. Remember before he was happy just to rule his own little thing. So then because

122
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,440
 of that pride, because of that anger, he then goes into another town and he tries to capture

123
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:09,640
 that one. Again, he basically runs all the residents in that town up into their tower.

124
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,800
 And what's he thinking? Look, that's a stupid idea guys. I just destroyed a thousand people

125
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,040
 in a tower in my own town. I'm going to do the same with you guys. I'm going to set you

126
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,940
 guys all on fire and you'll be done. But what he doesn't know is his pride ends up leading

127
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:30,140
 to his destruction because in that tower, one woman drops a really big heavy stone,

128
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:35,340
 a millstone, drops it down from the top of the tower and it so happens to hit Abimelech

129
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:41,420
 in the head and crushes his skull. But he doesn't quite die immediately. He knows that

130
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:47,380
 he's just had a millstone being crushed, dropped by a woman onto his head and he knows he's

131
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:53,420
 about to die. But then he goes to a soldier next to him and says, "Hey, draw your sword

132
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,860
 and you kill me because I don't want to be that guy that gets known to be killed by a

133
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:06,440
 woman." So then you can see still that pride that existed in Abimelech even to the very

134
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:14,180
 last breath. And that is the story of Abimelech. That's it. And you're just thinking, "Oh my

135
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,460
 goodness, why is this in the scriptures? This is just the most terrible story. There is

136
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:24,460
 not a single verse here that really is edifying or glorifying in any way. What is going on

137
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,740
 here?" And I thought that today as I'm sharing this passage to you over Zoom, I'm just thinking,

138
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:36,980
 you know what Abimelech did? He just gave us a crash course on bad leadership 101. Bad

139
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,940
 leadership 101. And of course, I think there are people in this world, current world leaders

140
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,860
 who could probably do the same for us right now. But Abimelech here is the one in the

141
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,460
 scriptures who's doing this for us. And I'm wanting to share a couple of points that I've

142
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:54,020
 observed about being a bad leader that Abimelech was and seeing how that can apply into our

143
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:01,700
 lives. And the first thing is this, Abimelech was power hungry. Power hungry. You see, he

144
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:07,300
 was one of 71 boys and he decided that he wanted all the power. He was ambitious, he

145
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:14,300
 was manipulative, he was scheming. The problem is this, true leaders earn the right to lead.

146
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,500
 True leaders earn the right to lead. And you see, the thing is, at this point Israel had

147
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,340
 no king because Israel wasn't supposed to have a king. Israel's king was supposed to

148
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:30,700
 be who? God. God was supposed to be the one who was supposed to lead this nation. But

149
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,140
 you see, this is the thing that reminded me and really convicted me. As I look down on

150
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,420
 Abimelech, as I'm looking at him thinking, you, why are you, your life is just, you're

151
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,860
 incredibly stupid. But then I realized inside the heart of every person is this desire to

152
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:53,540
 be king, is this desire to be God. That we are all in some ways power hungry, at least

153
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:59,740
 I am. And you might think, well, I'm not that bad. I'm not as bad as Abimelech. And for

154
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,780
 me, I hope I'm not either. But then I'm thinking, you know what, maybe there are some aspects

155
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:10,380
 of my life where I am in desire, where I'm desiring to be God myself. Every time I try

156
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:16,500
 and take control of something in my life, every time I try to pursue my own ambitions,

157
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,420
 my own agenda, every time I feel as though I'm offended by someone or I've been slighted

158
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,100
 by someone and I want to take it into my own hands and I want to take control of the situation.

159
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,860
 I want to assert authority in my own life over someone else. Maybe that's revealing

160
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,060
 that I have a desire to be God, that I have that same desire. And I think inside the heart

161
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:44,780
 of every person is that desire to be in control. I don't know about you. I don't know what

162
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:51,060
 areas of your life you feel that you are always wanting to make sure that everything is settled,

163
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,300
 everything is under control. And a lot of these feelings don't come from a bad place.

164
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,140
 We're not trying to take over the world. We just want our own lives to be set in our own

165
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:08,660
 ways based on our own preferences. And I think in some ways that itself is us trying to wrestle

166
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:14,740
 away control from God. That is us not being willing to relinquish control and surrendering

167
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,780
 to God. Inside the heart of every person is that desire to be God. And the problem is

168
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:26,140
 this, that is the reason for the fall of mankind. That is what caused Adam and Eve to make that

169
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,820
 first mistake, wanting to feel that they are God, that they are the ones that know everything,

170
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,300
 they are in control. And so it really requires all of us, brothers and sisters, to ask ourselves,

171
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,700
 what areas of our lives do we think we are actually being power hungry, that we haven't

172
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:47,660
 actually surrendered to God? You know, we ask, the Psalmist asks in Psalm 139, "God,

173
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,340
 you have to search my heart and test my thoughts to see if there is any offensive way in me

174
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,540
 because I know my heart is deceitful. There are areas in my life that I know that I am

175
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:03,380
 refusing to relinquish control. I know right there I am wanting to be king. I am wanting

176
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:10,020
 to be God." You know, I took two weeks off recently and I watched an old film, an old

177
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:17,060
 favorite of mine called Gladiator, Gladiator by Russell Crowe. And Russell Crowe plays

178
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:24,020
 this mighty warrior who is in charge of the Roman Empire called Maximus. And there's a

179
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,900
 scene early on in the film, and I'm not afraid to give you spoilers, it's been like 20 years

180
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,500
 that you've had every chance to watch it. There's the scene where Caesar, the emperor,

181
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,740
 is about to die. So he's looking for someone to succeed him. And of course, he has his

182
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:45,020
 own son, but his own son is a little bit like a Bimelic. So he wants to give control to

183
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:51,740
 Maximus, Russell Crowe. And then Russell Crowe, so he tells Russell Crowe, he tells Maximus,

184
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:57,540
 "I want you to take over my empire." And Russell Crowe tells him, "No, it can't be me. I can't

185
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,780
 do it. I don't want to do it." And then Caesar tells him, "That's exactly the reason why

186
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:07,700
 you are the only one who can, who should, because you don't want that power. You don't

187
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:14,020
 want that control." In some ways, it's the same as a true leaders are not power hungry.

188
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,900
 True leaders are not power hungry. They're not ambitious in the way that they want to

189
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,620
 seize power. But really, true leaders are humble. True leaders are humble and not power

190
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:30,900
 hungry. I see I'm triggering a lot of holy conversation in the chat room about Gradiator

191
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,900
 Now. Well done, everyone. And I'm seeing lots of smiles and giggles, clearly not about my

192
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:41,540
 sermon because it was supposed to be very serious. Okay. Anyway, pay attention, class.

193
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,100
 Goodness me. Anyway, it is a really good movie. Yes, I did say you could talk, but now I'm

194
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:54,100
 regretting it. We should have closed the chat room. Note to self. Man, here I was thinking

195
00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:03,140
 Judges 9 was just so compelling. It was more about Gladiator. Anyway, bad leadership 101.

196
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:09,820
 True leaders are not supposed to be power hungry. Number two is this. True leaders do

197
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,820
 not recruit badly. You see, verse four, he takes this money and he goes, and who does

198
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:20,980
 he hire? Worthless and reckless fellows. People who he thinks will basically agree with his

199
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,020
 thoughts. You see, he knew what he was doing. He knew what he was doing because he knew

200
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,980
 he had to hire people who would not disagree with him. He had to hire people who would

201
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,980
 basically just do as he says. You see, true leaders, good leaders, godly leaders surround

202
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:44,780
 themselves with godly people. Surround themselves with people who they know will hold them accountable,

203
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:50,980
 who will tell them the truth. Abimelech, this king, surrounded himself with reckless fellows

204
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:56,500
 who basically would do whatever he said and would not hold him accountable at all. He

205
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,860
 surrounded himself with people who were of the same mind. But if you're a true leader,

206
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,540
 you would assemble people around you in your friendship groups. If you were a leader in

207
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:12,220
 the corporate field, you would hire people who would hold you accountable, who will basically

208
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,260
 disagree with you when you are wrong. Okay. And so this really brings me to my second

209
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:23,060
 thought, my second conviction, which is this, inside the heart of every person is the desire

210
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:28,620
 to be agreed with, to be listened to and to be agreed with. Inside the heart of every

211
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,860
 person is that desire to be agreed with. You know, Galatians, the apostle Paul talks about

212
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:39,860
 this 110, you know, are you seeking the approval of man or of God? And Abimelech is just finding

213
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,700
 people who will do whatever he says and basically do it. But really what we need, if we are

214
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,580
 to be leaders, and actually, what I can say here to all of these faces on the screens

215
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:56,460
 here, you are all called to be leaders. You are all called to be leaders because the church,

216
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,660
 the body of Christ is supposed to be the one that's leading people to God. And so it's

217
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:07,180
 very key that we, all of us here, surround ourselves with people who are not just yes

218
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:12,580
 men. We can see how damaging and destructive that is when we see some governments that

219
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:20,460
 maybe have this problem. We need to have people who are willing to hold us accountable. You

220
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,380
 see, there's a passage in scripture, which is a bad company corrupts good morals. And

221
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,940
 of course, Abimelech didn't really need any help getting corrupted, but you get the point

222
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:37,900
 here, which is that it is so important to be surrounded by good and godly people. So

223
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,300
 my question to all of us here is this, how are the people that are surrounding you? What

224
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:48,620
 are they like? Are they godly? Do they hold you accountable? Do they support you in the

225
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:54,260
 right way? Do they push you towards God or are they distracting you away from God? And

226
00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:00,900
 how do you perceive these people? Do you live for their approval? Or actually, are you actually

227
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,500
 able to put God as the highest and have these people around you? Who are the people that

228
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,260
 are surrounding you? And the other point is this, he did not invest in any of these people.

229
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,620
 He simply gave them money and they were just hired guns to basically help murder his brothers

230
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,420
 for him. And of course, I don't think any of us here are thinking of doing that right

231
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,860
 now, at least I hope not. But who are the people that God has placed around you? Or

232
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,060
 rather, who are the people that you're choosing to put around you yourself? You see, good

233
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:34,940
 leadership, good leaders choose carefully who they put around themselves. They invest

234
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:40,340
 in the right people and they are all people who are godly. So it's up to us to invest

235
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:48,460
 in the right people. And the final point is this, Bad Leadership 101.3 is he was pride

236
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:55,020
 filled. Ibn Malek's journey was all about pride. It was pride that caused him to want

237
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:00,940
 to be king. It was pride that caused him to get the money and recruit people to then kill

238
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,460
 others. It was pride that caused him, once his own people, the people of Shechem turned

239
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,500
 against him, it was pride that caused him to want to destroy his own town. He basically

240
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,180
 sabotaged his own kingdom. And then it was pride, something tripped in him, it caused

241
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,020
 him a power trip where he then decided, you know what, I'm just going to go and attack

242
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:23,060
 and capture the next town. And it was pride that caused him to basically lead himself

243
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:28,980
 to his own death. And it was pride that even before dying, in those final few moments,

244
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,300
 he still couldn't let it go. And he still needed his soldier to draw his sword to kill

245
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,540
 him so that it's not a woman who kills him. Can you see that this guy is just so full

246
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:46,260
 of pride, that this old saying that pride comes before every fall. And again, that pride

247
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:52,380
 comes from that desire to be lifted up to be God. And so my final reflection for me

248
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:59,540
 is inside every person is that desire to be exalted. Inside every person is that desire

249
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:05,460
 to be exalted and to be acknowledged and to be shown to be significant, important, talented.

250
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:12,820
 But you see, it's ironic, because it's his pride that led to his destruction. And Jesus

251
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,820
 talks about this. He says, the first will be last and the last will be first. Those

252
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,820
 who exalt themselves will be humbled. And it's only those who humble themselves who

253
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:29,580
 will be exalted. And Abimelech showed us that leadership is pride filled. And so that's

254
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:35,660
 Abimelech. Really, it shows us no good example of any good leadership. But it really reminds

255
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,140
 me and whilst we're looking at this, and we might be discouraged that wow, these people

256
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:46,180
 are so bad, I hope it really causes us to reflect on actually, where in my heart is

257
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:51,220
 there a little bit of Abimelech? And also, finally, to be encouraged that actually, there

258
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:58,260
 is a good leadership example out there. You see, at every area where Abimelech fell and

259
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:06,620
 failed, Jesus redeems and shows what good leadership is. So every opportunity that Abimelech

260
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:14,260
 had to display bad leadership 101, Jesus comes to redeem and shows us a good leadership 101.

261
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:20,300
 See, Jesus himself wasn't power hungry. He had the highest renown already. He had the

262
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,660
 throne in heaven. Yet, what does it say in Philippians? He didn't count equality with

263
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:31,140
 God something to be grasped. Instead, he let it go. And he humbled himself. He left his

264
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,260
 own throne to come down. And that's what made him the example that we should all follow.

265
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,900
 He humbled himself and dethroned himself. And even when he got here, not only did he

266
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,460
 choose to be born in a manger, but then even as an adult, he chose to wash his disciples'

267
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:53,820
 feet. He was the servant king. He was the one who showed us that true leadership is

268
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:59,420
 humble and not power hungry. And he also didn't recruit poorly. Yes, he chose disciples that

269
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:04,580
 had their flaws, but he invested in them. He spent three, four years living with them,

270
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:10,100
 doing life with them, making disciples of them. And that group of 12 ended up changing

271
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:16,540
 the world, ended up outliving the Roman empire, and ended up imitating him and being willing

272
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:24,620
 to lay down their own lives. And true good leadership is not pride filled. Jesus had

273
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,820
 the opportunity to have all the kingdoms. Even when he came down to the earth and he

274
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,460
 was taken into the wilderness by the spirit and he was face to face with the enemy, the

275
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:38,060
 enemy said, "Hey, look, here's a shortcut. You could be done with this. You don't need

276
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,420
 the cross. Look, if you came for the world, I'll give you the world. Here you go. You

277
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,940
 can have all the world. You just need to bow down to me. That's all you need. And you can

278
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:52,380
 get everything. Everything can be at your feet." And yet Jesus resisted. Jesus humbled

279
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:58,060
 himself to the Father's will. He humbled himself to the Father's will, even when he didn't

280
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:03,620
 feel like it. And that's where he asks, "It's your will that is done, Lord. I just want

281
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:10,660
 what you want, Father." So Jesus shows us that to be the best leader, we have to not

282
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:17,500
 be power hungry. We have to surround ourselves with the right people and we have to be humble.

283
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,460
 The best leaders in the world right now then are the people who are willing to follow him.

284
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:29,340
 The best leaders are the best followers. His leadership is one of submitting to God's authority

285
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:35,820
 and ending up with being having every name, the name above every name. And he is the only

286
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:42,300
 one that is worthy of us following him. So my prayer for all of us, as I conclude, is

287
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:48,180
 this. And a question that I want to ask you all to reflect is, are there any areas in

288
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:55,180
 your life where you could do with swapping out this Abimelech trait and swapping in a

289
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:02,140
 Jesus trait? Is there any area of your life where you are just still trying to wrestle

290
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:08,980
 control from God? And I want to encourage you to look to Jesus, that Jesus in his love

291
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:16,460
 for you was willing to let himself completely go and empty himself for you. And that is

292
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:24,580
 the best kind of leader. He is the example that we should aim to follow. And for us,

293
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,020
 as we are leaders in our industries, in our fields, or just in our friendship groups,

294
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:34,420
 we pray that we will exhibit that same trait that Jesus did, that we are the best leaders

295
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:40,620
 because we are the best followers of God. And our prayer is that the spirit is the one

296
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:47,620
 that guides us in any and every aspect of our lives. Let's pray.

297
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:57,980
 Father Lord, we thank you. We thank you that the Bible is real. The Bible is real and that

298
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:05,600
 it doesn't eliminate bad examples and characters like Abimelech, but that we get to see mankind

299
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,460
 that is worse. And we get to recognize and repent ourselves that actually, even in these

300
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:16,220
 terrible characters, there are some traits that we exhibit that are not too far off from

301
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:22,340
 them. And so Lord, I pray that you, your spirit will purify us and cleanse our hearts and

302
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,180
 search our hearts so that if there is any Abimelech in us, that Lord, in your name,

303
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,180
 they be removed. But Lord, that we decrease and you increase in our lives and that we

304
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:38,500
 all are molded and every day sanctified to becoming more and more like you. Lord, you

305
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:44,140
 are the true leader that we seek to follow. You are the servant king and we live and seek

306
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:51,580
 to follow your example. So we pray that you will reveal yourself more and more to us Lord.

307
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:57,060
 Thank you God. And as we go into a time of reflection with a song, Lord we pray that

308
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:02,260
 the words in the song will really guide us and be the cry of our hearts as we leave this

309
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:08,020
 Zoom call and share with each other. And as we live our lives in this strange time, Lord

310
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:13,260
 that we, our hearts, will follow you with all our hearts, all our minds. We thank you

311
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,540
 God. In Jesus name, Amen.
