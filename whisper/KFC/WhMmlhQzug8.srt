1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,560
 - Good evening, everybody.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,660
 And we've been going through Beware, Bit Grow.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,620
 Who's been enjoying 2 Peter?

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,520
 Some really important lessons in 2 Peter.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,520
 And Pastor John kicked us off the first week

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,160
 and he talked about the true Christian, right?

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,360
 The true Christian.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,600
 Oh, it's hard to breathe.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,640
 (laughing)

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,720
 I gotta inhale every time.

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,080
 All right.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,760
 Pastor John talked about the true Christian life

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,340
 the first week, right?

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,060
 When a Christian, sorry.

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,000
 When a Christian begins with faith

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,200
 and then what happens?

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,060
 There's results, right?

19
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,040
 There's spiritual growth that happens afterwards.

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,840
 And the spiritual growth leads to practical results, right?

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,040
 There are qualities that Peter listed there.

22
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,120
 It was love, it was goodness, it was knowledge.

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,640
 All of these things come about as we become more like God.

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,240
 And then Pastor James did a really powerful sermon

25
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,240
 last week, warning us on the false prophets way of life.

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,520
 Right?

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,020
 They are like people, like dogs actually,

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,860
 that come back to their own vomit,

29
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,260
 like freshly washed pigs that roll back into the mud.

30
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,700
 They are actually slaves to money, sex, and power.

31
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,560
 They're talking about freedom.

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,960
 They wanna live a free life,

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,960
 but they're actually enslaved by their own sensual desires.

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,960
 And Peter continues to talk about warnings

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,260
 of the false prophets.

36
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,300
 And we're gonna read together here, verse three.

37
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,420
 Let's read with me.

38
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,440
 One, two, three.

39
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,680
 "Knowing this, first of all,

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,840
 "that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing,

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,880
 "following their own sinful desires.

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,580
 "They will say, 'Where is the promise of his coming?'

43
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,140
 "For where ever since the fathers fell asleep,

44
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,820
 "all things are continuing as they were

45
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,520
 "from the beginning of creation."

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,360
 Scoffers.

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,860
 Peter warns us that scoffers will come.

48
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,960
 And what are scoffers?

49
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,720
 They're mockers.

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,180
 People that insult others.

51
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,160
 People who laugh at others.

52
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,680
 And in this case, who are they laughing at?

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,580
 Who are they laughing at here?

54
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,900
 They're laughing at God, right?

55
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,700
 Where is this coming, right, that he promised?

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,940
 God, where is this coming?

57
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,580
 And so they have two points that they point out

58
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,140
 that they're mocking and scoffing at.

59
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,940
 Where is the coming that he promised, which is God?

60
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,400
 Where is the coming of God that he promised?

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,380
 And his judgment.

62
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,340
 And his judgment.

63
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,620
 And the second thing, second point that they point out is,

64
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,380
 well, we don't see his coming

65
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,280
 because everything is the same as it has been

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,860
 since the beginning of creation.

67
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,780
 And one of these people that were really the opponents

68
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,780
 of Christianity at that time was Epicurus, right?

69
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,420
 And one of his quotes was, "Death does not concern us

70
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,440
 "because as long as we exist, death is not here.

71
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,540
 "And when it does come, we no longer exist."

72
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,260
 And so Epicurus is saying here,

73
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,580
 "Just live your life, enjoy your pleasures.

74
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,940
 "Nothing bad is gonna happen in the end.

75
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,220
 "And even if it does, we no longer exist.

76
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,600
 "It doesn't matter.

77
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,760
 "There's no judgment in the final days.

78
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,580
 "There's no judgment coming."

79
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,480
 And that's sort of similar to us today, is it not?

80
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,180
 YOLO, live your life.

81
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,320
 You only live once, right?

82
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,920
 Go enjoy your best wine, your steak dinners,

83
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,200
 and who knows, right?

84
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,300
 Enjoy the things, do the things you wanna do now.

85
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,680
 That's the kind of lifestyle we're living also in today.

86
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,320
 And so Peter offers us some responses to these things.

87
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,680
 And we're gonna look at this together.

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,320
 Let's read together verse five.

89
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,340
 For they deliberately overlook this fact

90
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,000
 that the heavens existed long ago

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,520
 and the earth was formed out of the water

92
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,280
 and through water by the word of God.

93
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,360
 And then by the means of these,

94
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,160
 the world that then existed was divulged

95
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,120
 with water and perished, deluged, sorry, deluged.

96
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,720
 And then the next verse, by the same word,

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,560
 the heavens and earth that now exist

98
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,700
 are stored up for a fire, being kept apart

99
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,820
 until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.

100
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,620
 Peter's first response is this.

101
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,520
 God spoke and what happened?

102
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,080
 The world existed.

103
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,540
 God spoke and there was light from the darkness.

104
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,700
 God spoke and land came out of the water.

105
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,100
 God spoke and there was animals.

106
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,120
 With his word, God creates.

107
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,480
 With his word, God creates.

108
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,720
 That's his first point.

109
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,100
 The second point is not only does the word of God create,

110
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,740
 the word of God can also destroy.

111
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,340
 He saw the evil that was in man's heart

112
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,260
 and he said, I will punish this earth, these people,

113
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,980
 and he sent a flood.

114
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,340
 And so with his word, he also destroyed.

115
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,820
 And so these scoffers, they're saying,

116
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,160
 whoa, there's no judgment, that's not true.

117
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,360
 In the beginning, God created the world

118
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,240
 and then destroyed it, but then he also restored it.

119
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,300
 There was a sense of restoration afterwards.

120
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:04,720
 And it says in the last verses that we read in verse seven

121
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,200
 that the word of God will also purify.

122
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,960
 The day of judgment is coming

123
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,160
 and the destruction of the ungodly.

124
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,220
 It's interesting 'cause back then,

125
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,580
 Noah was pleading with the people back then.

126
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,580
 The flood is coming, the flood is coming.

127
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,660
 Look at this huge ark that I built.

128
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,820
 It's massive and somehow it's in Hong Kong now.

129
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,220
 Come on this boat, a flood is coming.

130
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,140
 And you guys are just sitting on the beach in Repulse Bay,

131
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,460
 kicking the football around at Wan Chai Stadium

132
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,180
 and enjoying a great time eating and dining in Central.

133
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,920
 And then Noah's saying, the flood is coming,

134
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,620
 judgment is coming.

135
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,900
 And they're just laughing, scoffers, mockers, right?

136
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,520
 Like Noah, you must be a crazy man.

137
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,360
 You know, you may have had too much wine

138
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,740
 or some too many dinner wines with Pastor John.

139
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,860
 Is it not the same that back then

140
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,540
 they were also laughing at God, laughing at Noah?

141
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,040
 Where is this judgment?

142
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,660
 And then all of a sudden the rains came

143
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,840
 and judgment was there and God closed the door himself.

144
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,480
 God closed the door himself, judgment came.

145
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,580
 We continue in verse eight

146
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,820
 and we continue to see his response.

147
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,500
 Let's read together.

148
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,700
 But do not overlook this one fact, beloved.

149
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,940
 Let's read together.

150
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,060
 That with the Lord, one day is as a thousand years

151
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,080
 and a thousand years as one day.

152
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,160
 The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise

153
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,220
 as some count slowness, but is patient toward you,

154
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,900
 not wishing that any of you should perish,

155
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,640
 but all of you should reach repentance.

156
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,460
 Peter's fifth response is that the word of God

157
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,660
 is sustaining us.

158
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,220
 The reason why we can breathe,

159
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,960
 the reason why we can take each breath,

160
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,240
 that there's oxygen in the air,

161
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,740
 is because God, the word of God allows it.

162
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,820
 The reason why you can enjoy the goodness

163
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,820
 of the things on the earth is because God has allowed it.

164
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,160
 He sustains the world.

165
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,480
 He is the I am.

166
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,920
 He is present.

167
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,540
 He's in the past.

168
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,760
 He's not just a God that existed in the past,

169
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,480
 in the present, he is a God that is the I am,

170
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,820
 he is present.

171
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,820
 We see time as linear, continuously going forward.

172
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,780
 He sees it as a whole.

173
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,200
 He is the great I am.

174
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,060
 And Peter also says that we have

175
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,060
 a limited perspective of time, limited perspective.

176
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,740
 And we're gonna see in the next picture here,

177
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,260
 you know, because of all these Zoom things,

178
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,420
 you know, we do these Zoom games, right?

179
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,300
 This Zoom game is called, you know,

180
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,180
 Zoom in and Zoom out, right?

181
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,460
 What do you guys think this is?

182
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,020
 Take a guess.

183
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,220
 Any of you know?

184
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,700
 It looks like a mountain and with two eyes.

185
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,600
 Is it like a square puff thing?

186
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,480
 I don't know, character?

187
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,100
 What is it?

188
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,480
 Go on, book church logo, who got it?

189
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,940
 It's a Go on, book church, who got it?

190
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,220
 Who knew right away?

191
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,020
 Michelle, yeah, Agnes, yeah, maybe, okay.

192
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,000
 Carmen, very good.

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,540
 These people all work at church.

194
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,400
 They stare at it every day.

195
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,860
 But if we Zoom in just like before, we didn't know.

196
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,260
 Only like 1% of you knew.

197
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,740
 Anthony, how long have you been in this church?

198
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,820
 Did you know?

199
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,500
 You didn't know.

200
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,300
 We have a limited perspective of time.

201
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,100
 And that is what God is saying.

202
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,580
 Peter is saying here that God sees everything

203
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,980
 and we are so limited.

204
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,860
 And Peter says this, in fact,

205
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,340
 that the reason why God is allowing these things to happen

206
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,460
 and that God's judgment has not come yet

207
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,620
 is because he is patient.

208
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,320
 He's patient with you.

209
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,720
 He's patient with you.

210
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,860
 He knows your weakness.

211
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,580
 He knows your friends that have not come to know Jesus yet.

212
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,580
 And he's giving them time to repent.

213
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,220
 God is not slow.

214
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,020
 But God is patient.

215
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,300
 God is patient.

216
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,860
 The last response that Peter has is this.

217
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,120
 Let's read together.

218
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,780
 One, two, three.

219
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,900
 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief,

220
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,460
 and then the heavens will pass away with a roar,

221
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,100
 and the heavenly bodies will be burned and dissolved,

222
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,700
 and the earth and the works that are done in it

223
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,740
 will be exposed.

224
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,660
 The day of the Lord.

225
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,980
 The day of the Lord.

226
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,340
 It was prophesied in the Old Testament

227
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,040
 that the day of the Lord will come.

228
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,860
 Jesus talks about it,

229
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,940
 that the day of the Lord,

230
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,940
 the end times will come like a thief.

231
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,020
 And Peter's response is this,

232
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,100
 that there are three things that are gonna happen

233
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,780
 in the day of the Lord, the judgment day of the Lord.

234
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,420
 The first thing is that the heavens will pass away

235
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,520
 with a roar.

236
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,460
 Then the elements will be dissolved by fire.

237
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,580
 And the earth, finally,

238
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,340
 the earth and all that has been done in it

239
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,820
 will be disclosed or discovered or exposed.

240
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,700
 So what is this?

241
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,180
 What does this all mean?

242
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,260
 It's very sort of figurative and metaphorical.

243
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,420
 What does it all mean?

244
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,060
 Well, the heavens will pass away.

245
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,140
 We know that Jesus also talked about it as well,

246
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,020
 that the moon will turn into blood.

247
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,020
 In Revelations, we see right here,

248
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,740
 the sun turns black,

249
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,540
 the moon turned to blood red,

250
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,540
 the skies fell to the earth.

251
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,660
 The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up

252
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,360
 and every mountain and island was removed from its place.

253
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,500
 So firstly, we see that when Peter says

254
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,460
 that the heavens will pass away,

255
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,660
 he literally means probably the stars

256
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,500
 and the sun and the heavens,

257
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,700
 it will pass away like a scroll.

258
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,980
 And then he also talks about the elements here.

259
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,900
 What are the elements that are dissolved by fire?

260
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,340
 Well, there are actually several meanings

261
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,440
 to the word elements.

262
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,740
 The first, it could be the elements of the earth,

263
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,280
 the universe, right?

264
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,340
 Earth, air, fire, water, right?

265
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,780
 It could be that.

266
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,580
 Or it could also be that he's quoting Isaiah 34, four,

267
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,700
 which says that all the stars in the sky will be dissolved

268
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,740
 and the heavens rolled up like a scroll.

269
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,840
 All the starry hosts will fall

270
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,580
 like withered leaves from the vine,

271
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,540
 like shriveled figs from a fig tree.

272
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,900
 Basically, what he's saying here

273
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,580
 is that in the day of the Lord,

274
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,580
 the heavens, the skies will be rolled up like a scroll.

275
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,800
 Imagine it, the earth, the clouds,

276
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,460
 everything rolled up like a scroll.

277
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,440
 And then the earth is exposed.

278
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,480
 The earth is exposed, laid bare,

279
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,140
 and God's judgment will come.

280
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,140
 Nothing will get in the way of the judgment of God.

281
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,320
 Nothing will get in the way.

282
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,720
 And we see from this, from Peter's response here,

283
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,100
 that God's purpose is not to destroy the earth.

284
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:32,260
 God's purpose is to renew the earth,

285
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,860
 cleanse the earth of the ungodliness and sin

286
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,720
 so that there would be a new heaven and a new earth,

287
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,540
 a new heaven and a new earth.

288
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,760
 One that is without sin,

289
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,960
 one that is made whole and new again.

290
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,740
 And my question to you today is,

291
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,740
 do you believe that God will one day judge the earth?

292
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,660
 That one day he will come

293
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,020
 and that one day he will make everything new,

294
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,420
 that there will be a new heaven and a new earth?

295
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,420
 Who believes it?

296
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,660
 Raise your hand.

297
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,120
 Yeah, everybody here?

298
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,240
 Most people?

299
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,080
 Very good.

300
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,900
 Let me just sum up what we've learned

301
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,180
 in 2 Peter so far.

302
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,620
 So Pastor John talked about the true Christian

303
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,260
 and then James talked about the first warning,

304
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,940
 the prophet's way of life.

305
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,120
 And then I just went through the prophet's wrong theology,

306
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,300
 that there's no second coming,

307
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,700
 that there's no judgment, right?

308
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,460
 And then we will see in the next couple of verses,

309
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,100
 we saw Peter's response,

310
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,940
 and next we will see how to live as a true Christian

311
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,180
 in the last days.

312
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,500
 How do we live as a true Christian in the last days?

313
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,980
 And so let's continue to read verse 11 together.

314
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,380
 One, two, three.

315
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,740
 Since all these things are thus to be dissolved,

316
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,020
 what sort of people ought you to live

317
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,180
 in lives of holiness and godliness,

318
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,340
 waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of the Lord,

319
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,060
 because of which the heavens will be set on fire

320
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,300
 and dissolved,

321
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,900
 and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn?

322
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,720
 But according to his promise,

323
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,840
 we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth

324
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,420
 in which his righteousness dwells.

325
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,500
 And so Peter begs the question,

326
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,820
 if all these things are to be dissolved

327
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,180
 and the earth is supposed to be cleansed

328
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,580
 and there should be a new heaven and a new earth,

329
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,940
 what kind of people should we be?

330
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,220
 What kind of people should we be?

331
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,260
 And I don't have time to go through everything together.

332
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,720
 I'm just gonna sum it up a little bit here.

333
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,580
 The first thing he tells us

334
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,700
 is that we need to have character.

335
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,500
 We need to have character.

336
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,860
 And he mentioned it in verse 11,

337
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,860
 that we need to live lives of holiness and godliness.

338
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,980
 And what is holiness?

339
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,140
 Holiness is that we are set apart for his thing,

340
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,620
 for his glory, for his purposes.

341
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,860
 We are to be set apart.

342
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,020
 In verse 14, as we'll see later,

343
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,980
 we are to be spotless and blameless.

344
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,180
 And so in our character,

345
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,900
 if God is really coming and we are in the last days,

346
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,220
 how should we live?

347
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,220
 We should live holy lives, spotless lives.

348
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,940
 And how do we do that?

349
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,100
 How do we do that?

350
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,180
 We have to live according to his word.

351
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,780
 We have to live according to his word.

352
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,600
 It's so hard nowadays with all the temptations.

353
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,980
 You walk down the subway and you might see an advertisement

354
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,060
 that causes you to be in temptation.

355
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:11,100
 A couple clicks on your phone and you can be in temptation.

356
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,220
 It's such a challenge now,

357
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,220
 especially in the last days, to be holy.

358
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:25,080
 And how do you be holy when everything,

359
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,040
 there's a spotlight on each one of us at times?

360
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,460
 You know, it's been sad to see some

361
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,740
 of these Christian leaders that we've looked upon

362
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:42,740
 and they've fallen and they haven't lived in holiness,

363
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,300
 spotless and blameless.

364
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,540
 It's not easy.

365
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,620
 There's so much temptation, so much challenge nowadays.

366
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,340
 The second thing that Peter tells us

367
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,660
 is that we have to watch our actions in the last days.

368
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,820
 These are the last days.

369
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,560
 He tells us that we need to hasten the coming of the Lord.

370
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,340
 Another interpretation of that

371
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,220
 is speed the coming of the Lord.

372
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,700
 Well, how do you speed the coming of the Lord?

373
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,660
 You know, how do you like, do you put the,

374
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,980
 you know, pedal to the metal?

375
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,800
 You know, how do you do it?

376
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,900
 There's several things that can speed

377
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,060
 the coming of the Lord.

378
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,260
 Evangelism, as you share the gospel,

379
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,900
 as you share the message of hope,

380
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:36,580
 you are speeding his coming because Jesus prophesied

381
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,220
 all the earth will hear of the gospel

382
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,060
 and then the end shall come.

383
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,100
 And then the end shall come.

384
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,340
 You can read that in the gospels.

385
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,820
 As we pray, as we pray that his kingdom come,

386
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,980
 we are speeding the coming of the Lord.

387
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,980
 As we are serving one another,

388
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,740
 building up the body of Christ,

389
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,380
 building up his kingdom,

390
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,820
 as we are serving the homeless, the needy,

391
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,900
 the Napoli street cleaners,

392
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,160
 the local school kids and teaching them English

393
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,900
 and teaching them Bible stories on Saturday,

394
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,220
 we are speeding the coming of the Lord

395
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,780
 'cause his word is being known.

396
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,780
 Our action is to speed the coming of the Lord.

397
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,900
 And we are also to grow in the grace of the Lord.

398
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,660
 We need to be like Jesus.

399
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,820
 How did Jesus show grace?

400
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,420
 He touched the leper.

401
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,380
 Nobody wanted to.

402
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,740
 They had their own separate room, right?

403
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,740
 It was roommate, right?

404
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,680
 I'm joking.

405
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,820
 They had their own room that Jesus touched the leper.

406
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,180
 Jesus ate with the tax collector.

407
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,540
 And the sinners.

408
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,420
 Jesus talked to the prostitute.

409
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,740
 Let the prostitute put oil.

410
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,540
 You know, Mary Magdalene put oil on him.

411
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,860
 Or adulterer, right?

412
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,420
 Everybody wanted to stone the adulterer,

413
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,980
 but he said, "He who is without sin,

414
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,460
 "let him cast the first stone."

415
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,860
 We need to be growing in the grace of Jesus.

416
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,140
 How is your action today?

417
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,780
 In these last time, what is your actions?

418
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,320
 Is it speeding the coming of the Lord?

419
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,940
 The next thing he said is our trust.

420
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,100
 Our trust that God's judgment is coming.

421
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,800
 One day he will return.

422
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,460
 Our trust is that God will cleanse the earth.

423
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,100
 Everything will be made new.

424
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,160
 There will be a new heaven and a new earth.

425
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,160
 God will come.

426
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,280
 God will do as he promised.

427
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,140
 He is a man of his word.

428
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,780
 He is a God of his word.

429
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,260
 We're gonna skip a couple of verses

430
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,860
 and go to verse 17.

431
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,580
 Verse 17.

432
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,620
 Let's read that together.

433
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,060
 One, two, three.

434
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,900
 "Therefore, dear friends,

435
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,900
 "since you have been forewarned,

436
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,760
 "be on your guard so that you may not be carried away

437
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,600
 "by the error of the lawless

438
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,620
 "and fall from your secure position.

439
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,900
 "But grow in the grace and knowledge

440
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,700
 "of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

441
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,880
 "To him be the glory, both now and forever.

442
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,820
 "Amen."

443
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,980
 Peter continues and says, "Be on your guard."

444
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,020
 Be on your guard.

445
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,940
 And last week, Pastor John warned us.

446
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,100
 There's these people, these groups of people

447
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,300
 coming after the youth specifically.

448
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,300
 We need to be on our guard.

449
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,580
 And Peter says this specifically here.

450
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,380
 Do not be carried away by the error of the lawless,

451
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,580
 or you will fall from your secured position.

452
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,160
 Our position in Christ.

453
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,820
 We need to be on guard.

454
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,140
 Be careful.

455
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,060
 Be careful of the heresies that are out there,

456
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,300
 of those who lead people astray.

457
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:36,100
 There are people that are preaching false testimonies.

458
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,660
 We need to be aware.

459
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:44,980
 And lastly, he shared this, our knowledge.

460
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,420
 Our knowledge.

461
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,860
 We need to grow in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

462
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,420
 And he also sums up, all the apostles agree.

463
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,340
 Even Paul, right?

464
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,660
 He mentions that specifically.

465
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:06,380
 How do we know how to defend ourselves from heresy

466
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,500
 if we don't know the word of God?

467
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,660
 If you don't know the truth, how can you tell?

468
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,580
 You can't.

469
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:20,540
 You must dig deep into the word of God.

470
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,260
 Grow in our knowledge of him.

471
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:27,540
 And so Peter is challenging us

472
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,180
 as Christians in the last times,

473
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,280
 and these are the last times, last days,

474
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,820
 that we need to be living as true Christians.

475
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,820
 And true Christians are spotless, holy in their character.

476
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,060
 They strive for holiness and spotlessness

477
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,700
 in their character, as we see in the next slide.

478
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,220
 He's challenging our action.

479
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,820
 We need to be hastening, speeding the coming of the Lord,

480
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,300
 sharing the gospel, serving those around us,

481
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,140
 loving the people around us,

482
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,060
 praying for his kingdom to come.

483
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,580
 We need to be trusting that God's word is true.

484
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,660
 His promises are true.

485
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,580
 We need to be on our guard.

486
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,140
 There are heresies out there.

487
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,540
 There are false prophets out there.

488
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:24,340
 And we need to be growing in the knowledge of God.

489
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,900
 And so my question to you today is this.

490
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,900
 Do you truly believe that God will come and judge the world?

491
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,660
 Do you truly believe?

492
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,260
 'Cause if you believe it,

493
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:46,140
 your belief will influence your actions, right?

494
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,860
 Your belief will influence your actions.

495
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,900
 If you truly believe it,

496
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,620
 then you would change the way you are living

497
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,900
 as a Christian in the last days.

498
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,660
 I remember when I was younger,

499
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,180
 as we see a picture of me in the younger self.

500
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,820
 No, I'm joking.

501
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,860
 (laughing)

502
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,260
 I remember when I was young.

503
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,820
 I grew up in the church as a pastor's kid.

504
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,860
 And I knew of all the stories,

505
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,940
 just like some of your kids,

506
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
 they grew up in the church,

507
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,980
 they knew of all the Bible stories,

508
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,540
 but I didn't believe it.

509
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,780
 And so one day my mom came into my room and said,

510
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,980
 have you truly placed Jesus

511
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,220
 as the Lord and Savior of your life?

512
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,100
 And I didn't, as an eight or a nine-year-old, I didn't.

513
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,780
 And so I prayed a prayer with my mom.

514
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,900
 And I asked Jesus into my life.

515
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,700
 I believed that Jesus existed at that time.

516
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,300
 And that influenced my action to place my trust in Him.

517
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,420
 I placed my trust in Him.

518
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,820
 And then when I was 14, there was a dedication night.

519
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,620
 And you know, we've had Explorer camps in the past,

520
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,620
 and we've had a dedication night.

521
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,580
 And the first dedication is dedicating yourself to God.

522
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,900
 The second one is to live your life,

523
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,220
 live a Christian life, live as a Christian.

524
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,340
 And the third is to serve the Lord full-time.

525
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,460
 And on this summer camp,

526
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,820
 my dad is the pastor and he's talking.

527
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,660
 He's like, Jesus has given everything for you.

528
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,580
 He's died on the cross for your sins.

529
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,180
 What is your response?

530
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:47,100
 How are you gonna respond to the Lord?

531
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,860
 And when I was 14 at that time,

532
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,500
 remember back when you were 14,

533
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,780
 at that time, I felt the Holy Spirit.

534
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:02,940
 The Holy Spirit was just touching my life.

535
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,020
 And there was just such deep conviction

536
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,380
 that I am a sinner, I need a Savior.

537
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,500
 And the Savior has given up everything for me.

538
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,780
 And what is my response?

539
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,700
 My response was, it was natural.

540
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,860
 I'm just gonna give my life to God.

541
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,940
 And so that day, when I was 14, I walked up

542
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,500
 and I gave my life to serve Jesus full-time.

543
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,900
 I believed God saved me.

544
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,940
 I believed God gave his life for me.

545
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,980
 And that influenced my action.

546
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,980
 My action was what?

547
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,340
 I'm willing to give up my life to serve you full-time.

548
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,500
 When I was in university,

549
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,460
 I got involved with a Christian group.

550
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,780
 And this Christian group went out

551
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,020
 and had spiritual conversations with students on campus.

552
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,660
 They did surveys, like, oh, what do you think about Easter?

553
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,060
 It's coming up.

554
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,340
 Oh, do you think Easter,

555
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,780
 does it have any religious connotation for you?

556
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,340
 And some people said yes, some people said no.

557
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,900
 And I remember this one conversation

558
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,780
 with somebody who was an atheist.

559
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,420
 He got so angry at the belief of God

560
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,380
 because there were so many evil things

561
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,580
 that are happening in this world.

562
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,860
 How can this supposedly righteous God

563
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,900
 let all these bad things happen?

564
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,140
 And he got so angry and was like, okay, calm down.

565
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,180
 We're just trying to have a conversation,

566
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,380
 see what you think.

567
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,900
 No need to be so emotional about it.

568
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,460
 But at that time, that was the first time I saw

569
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:52,780
 that there are other, really other beliefs in this world,

570
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,780
 strong, opinionated beliefs that were against God.

571
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:03,580
 You know, I lived in that Christian bubble.

572
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,780
 Everything was good.

573
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,660
 Everybody believed in the same thing.

574
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,740
 And when I stepped out in the university,

575
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,140
 I saw, I believed

576
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,540
 that this world had all these sorts of different beliefs.

577
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:24,300
 And my belief that the world was different

578
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:30,220
 caused me to really have a desire to share the gospel.

579
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,140
 Before I thought, oh,

580
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,900
 everybody sort of believes the same thing.

581
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,820
 We all live in the happy Christian bubble.

582
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,340
 Everybody sing kumbaya.

583
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:46,980
 That when we had that conversation with that atheist

584
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,620
 and he got so emotional and he believed it so much,

585
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:56,580
 that's when my belief influenced my action.

586
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,140
 And that's when my passion

587
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,380
 to share the gospel really started.

588
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,980
 On campus, we started sharing the gospel

589
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,500
 and I started learning more about Jesus

590
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,420
 and his ministry and his ministry of building up disciples.

591
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,260
 And I saw, wow, he had a vision.

592
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,020
 It wasn't just, he was just randomly walking around.

593
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,300
 Oh, this looks like a nice spot on Google Maps.

594
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,940
 Let's go here and see what happens.

595
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,460
 No, he had a strategic plan,

596
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,860
 building up the disciples around him,

597
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,500
 training them, seeing them grow

598
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,060
 so that they could also multiply.

599
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:43,620
 My belief that Jesus had a strategic plan

600
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:48,900
 influenced me to now want to make disciples,

601
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,900
 build up the next generation of leaders.

602
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:59,180
 And so that's become my mission statement of life.

603
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,260
 Share the gospel, build up leaders for the next generation,

604
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:10,900
 for the gospel, Christ-centered believers.

605
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:16,500
 And then I started to work in finance.

606
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,860
 Who works in finance?

607
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,420
 It's a lovely place, isn't it?

608
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:26,140
 Full of love and care and not greed and giving, right?

609
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,620
 I worked in finance in Toronto.

610
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,500
 I was in some of the major banks for two years.

611
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,540
 And I saw the greed of the people.

612
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:44,540
 They were consumed with money, money, sex, power.

613
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:49,380
 Fake it till you make it.

614
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,620
 That's what I was taught.

615
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:56,060
 And then I came to Hong Kong

616
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,540
 and I see how much you guys work.

617
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,940
 You guys really like to work, you know?

618
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,900
 Nine to nine, sometimes, you know,

619
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,940
 these guys work at nine to two

620
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,980
 and then wake up and then work again.

621
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:13,740
 They're slaves.

622
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,300
 It's like becoming a slave to the greed,

623
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,740
 slave to the work, slave to the money.

624
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,980
 And my belief, my understanding of what was happening

625
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,900
 in the corporate world influenced my desire

626
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:37,020
 to share the gospel with the people, the working people.

627
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,660
 Why do I work with university students?

628
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,460
 So that one day when they come up into work,

629
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,140
 they'll live Christ-centered lives.

630
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,860
 They'll do so well in their job

631
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,820
 and yet they'll do so well

632
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,340
 in glorifying God at the same time.

633
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,980
 That'd be so cool.

634
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,460
 A lineup of lawyers, professors,

635
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,020
 glorifying God in whatever they do.

636
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:10,540
 My belief influenced my actions.

637
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,660
 So my question to you today

638
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:20,580
 is what is your action telling you

639
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,300
 about what you truly believe?

640
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:27,220
 What is your action telling you

641
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,060
 about what you truly believe?

642
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:36,060
 Does that make sense?

643
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,340
 It does.

644
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:46,340
 And my hope to you is that God

645
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,380
 is speaking into your heart today.

646
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,980
 These are the last times.

647
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,140
 There is a sense of urgency.

648
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:59,180
 We need to see people come to know Jesus

649
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,460
 as we share his gospel.

650
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,380
 We need to trust that God is using us

651
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,500
 as we share his word, as we step out in faith.

652
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:12,820
 I trust that God is speaking to you tonight

653
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,660
 and telling you that there is a sense of urgency.

654
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,500
 We need to change our action.

655
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,420
 We need to change our character.

656
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,860
 We need to change what we trust.

657
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:29,860
 We need to trust that Jesus is coming

658
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,820
 and he will judge the earth one day.

659
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,700
 I'm gonna ask the worship team to come up

660
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,820
 as we take a time to pray.

661
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,660
 Let's just bow down our heads

662
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,500
 and take a moment to reflect

663
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,860
 what is our belief?

664
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:57,260
 Do we truly believe that God is coming?

665
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:03,220
 That he will judge in the last days?

666
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:09,980
 Do we truly believe that God is asking us

667
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,740
 to make disciples of all nations,

668
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,580
 to go to the ends of the earth?

669
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,500
 Let's take a moment to respond.

670
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:41,420
 (soft piano music)

671
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,180
 (soft piano music)

672
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,700
 (soft piano music)

673
00:36:48,700 --> 00:37:10,620
 (soft piano music)

674
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,540
 (soft piano music)

675
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:21,460
 Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word in 2 Peter.

676
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,860
 It's a reminder for us as Christians

677
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,900
 in the last days that we need to prepare for your coming.

678
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,900
 There is work to be done.

679
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,140
 You are patient with us.

680
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,660
 You're patient with our friends and those around us.

681
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,140
 You're giving us an opportunity to repent

682
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,660
 and share the gospel with them.

683
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:52,020
 Lord, give us this passion to live for you.

684
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:56,420
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

685
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,260
 Let's stand.
