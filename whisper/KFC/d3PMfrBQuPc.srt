1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 (Cantonese) Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 (Cantonese) We will continue to look at the "Tipsa Loriga" preface.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 (Cantonese) We have come to the fourth chapter.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 (Cantonese) I would like to ask you a question.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 (Cantonese) Maybe the reply is a bit scary.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 (Cantonese) But it's okay.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 (Cantonese) Okay, I will ask you a question.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 (Cantonese) I wonder if your parents have ever been on a trip,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 (Cantonese) when you were children.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 (Cantonese) What would they tell you when they were on a trip?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 (Cantonese) When they left you at home.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 (Cantonese) What would they tell you?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 (Cantonese) Be good.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 (Cantonese) Be good.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 (Cantonese) When my mother was on a trip,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 (Cantonese) or when she went to work,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 (Cantonese) she would say, "Be good."

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 (Cantonese) If you think more closely,

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 (Cantonese) like when you go to VBS,

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 (Cantonese) if you take your students to camp,

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 (Cantonese) you may have to leave the room for a while,

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 (Cantonese) what would you tell them?

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 (Cantonese) Be good.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 (Cantonese) Actually, the "Tipsa Loriga" preface

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 is very similar to this.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Jesus had just left them,

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 leaving behind a group of believers.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 But he promised that he would return.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 What do you think Jesus would tell them

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 after he left?

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Or what would he tell the "Tipsa Loriga"

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 brothers and sisters?

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 What would he tell them?

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 He would tell them that he cared a lot

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 about the situation of the church at that time.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 What was the situation of the church at that time?

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 The church was facing a very serious oppression.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Whether it was in the 17th chapter of the Book of Mormon,

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 the Jews were angry at the Christians

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 for taking away their people

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 and not believing in Judaism anymore.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 So he persecuted them.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 The Romans also felt that these Christians

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 did not follow the laws of the Roman government,

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 so he persecuted them.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 What was even worse was that

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 these believers, after following Jesus,

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 their lives changed.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Because they were new believers,

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 their habits changed

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 from what they were in the past.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 When they left their old lives,

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 some people would think,

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 "What's wrong? Why did you change?"

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So he began to persecute them.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 So the whole context of the "Tipsa Loriga" church

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 shows what was happening at that time.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 The first three chapters talk about trials,

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 and you will be persecuted.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 The fourth chapter talks about temptations,

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 and you will be persecuted.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 But it doesn't matter.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 The fifth chapter talks about Jesus

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 coming back.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 In the whole "Tipsa Loriga" preface,

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Jesus will come back is a very important message.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 From the first to the fifth chapter,

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 each chapter reminds us

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 to look into the hope.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 No matter what happens,

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 no matter the trials,

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 no matter the temptations,

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 you can be assured that

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Jesus will come back one day.

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 This is a proof that Paul wants to give

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 to the "Tipsa Loriga" church.

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 So you all have to hold on.

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 You have to be obedient.

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Today we will focus on the fourth chapter,

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 the coming of the temptations.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 I will read the "Tipsa Loriga" preface

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 from the first to the second chapter.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 It says,

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 "We have come to you,

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 "by Jesus Christ,

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 "to ask you,

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 "to urge you,

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 "since you have received our teaching,

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 "knowing how to act as men,

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 "to receive the joy of God.

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 "You have done just that.

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 "I urge you to work harder.

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 "You know what commandment we have given you

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 "by Jesus Christ."

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Paul tells the "Tipsa Loriga" church,

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 "I am going to lay out some things

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 "to tell you how you can please God."

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 In English, it is,

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 "How to live in order to please God."

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 As a witness,

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 there is a very common question

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 I am often asked.

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 How can I discern the will of God?

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Pastor, please pray with me.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Please find the will of God with me.

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I want to walk in God's will.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 How many of you

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 would like to walk in God's will?

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Most of you.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I don't think I am raising my hand.

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Most of you.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 You are all sitting here.

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 You are all hoping to walk in God's will.

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Whether you can do it is another matter.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 But I think the real question

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 that should be asked is,

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 "How much do you really want to live in the will of God?"

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 How willing are you to follow God's commandment,

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 even if this is not the most convenient

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 or the most comfortable?

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Why do I need to talk about this?

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Because Jesus,

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 from the third chapter,

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 says,

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 "It is God's will that you should be sanctified,

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 that you should avoid sexual immorality,

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 that each of you should learn to control your own body

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 in a way that is holy and honorable,

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 not in passionate lusts like the pagans

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 who do not know God."

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Let me talk about this first.

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 This is God's commandment.

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Just now, everyone said

134
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 that they are willing to follow God's commandment.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 This is very clear.

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 God's commandment is,

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 "You should be sanctified,

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 that you should avoid sexual immorality,

139
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 that each of you should learn to control your own body

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 in a way that is holy and honorable,

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 that each of you should learn to control your own body

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 and avoid sexual immorality."

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 In the Bible,

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 not many places,

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 or in the Old Testament,

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 not many places directly say

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 that this is God's commandment.

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 In the five chapters of the Old Testament,

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 only four places say this.

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 This is the first place.

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 The other three places

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 are in the fifth chapter,

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 the 16th to the 18th chapter.

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 In fact, it is all in one paragraph.

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 "You should be sanctified,

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 that you should not commit adultery,

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 that you should be grateful for everything."

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Because this is God's commandment

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 to you in Christ Jesus.

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 In fact, there are only four things.

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 God clearly says,

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 "This is my commandment."

163
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 First, avoid sexual immorality.

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Second, be sanctified.

165
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Third, not to commit adultery.

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Fourth, be grateful for everything.

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 It is very clear.

168
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 In many places in the Bible,

169
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 some teachings

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 do not 100% list out

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 what you should do.

172
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 We often need to continue to pray

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 to get the principles in the Bible

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 to let us know

175
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 how to apply God's commandment on earth.

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 But this is very clear.

177
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Paul says, "Avoid sexual immorality."

178
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 It is a direct commandment.

179
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 If this is the case,

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 the first question is,

181
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 what is sexual immorality?

182
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I don't know what you think.

183
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 If we ask what sexual immorality is,

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 maybe you are thinking of

185
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 some answers,

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 like what you should not do,

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 what you should not do,

188
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 then it is already sexual immorality.

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 If I look at it from another perspective,

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 if I want to know what sexual immorality is,

191
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 then we need to understand

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 how God defines sexual purity.

193
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 What is the essence of sex in God?

194
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 God's idea of sexual purity.

195
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Faithfulness in marriage.

196
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Loyalty in marriage.

197
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Abstinence in singleness.

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 In single life,

199
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 you need to abstain.

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 So, it means that

201
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 sexual relations

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 need to happen in marriage.

203
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Sorry, I have to talk about sensitive topics today.

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I will use some words that I have used before.

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 You are all grown up.

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 I am not afraid to say it.

207
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So,

208
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 sexual relations need to happen in marriage.

209
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 You must be wondering

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 why it needs to happen in marriage.

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 In Chinese,

212
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 sexual relations,

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 the original Chinese word for it is

214
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 "shakav",

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 which means "lie down".

216
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 "Lie down" means

217
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 two people trust each other to a certain extent.

218
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 You lie down next to the other person

219
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 and put down all your prejudices.

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 In this case,

221
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 you are putting your most vulnerable side

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 in front of the other person.

223
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 This is a very intimate moment.

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 It needs protection.

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Unless you know

226
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 you are under a protected environment,

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 you cannot relax

228
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 and release your vigilance.

229
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Marriage is a protection.

230
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 In a marriage,

231
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 you will tell the other person

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 "I give myself to you,

233
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 and for the rest of our lives,

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 we will serve and protect each other."

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 In a marriage like this,

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 in a relationship like this,

237
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 it is not possible to have a relationship

238
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 without a marriage.

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 This is the original purpose

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 of the Bible,

241
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 the original purpose of the Bible

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 for the Hebrews.

243
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 The next question you will ask is

244
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 "In a marriage,

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 you say that this kind of relationship

246
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 can only exist."

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 "If I am not married yet,

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 and I am not married yet,

249
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 and I am not married yet,

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 and I am not married yet,

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 and I am not married yet,

252
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 will I be okay?"

253
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 In the Bible,

254
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 this word is rarely used.

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 It is rarely used,

256
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 "sexual intercourse."

257
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 But it is used,

258
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 "sexual intimacy."

259
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 In the third chapter of the book,

260
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 we read Paul's words

261
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 about sexual intimacy.

262
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 In the third chapter of the book,

263
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 we read Paul's words about sexual intimacy.

264
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 In the third chapter of the book,

265
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 we read Paul's words about sexual intimacy.

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 In fact, the Hebrew word "pornia"

267
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 In fact, the Hebrew word "pornia"

268
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 may sound like the English word

269
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 "pornography."

270
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 may sound like the English word

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 "pornography."

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 This is a very broad term

273
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 for the Hebrew word.

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 It is not just about one thing.

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 This very broad term,

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 "sexual intimacy,"

277
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 covers many aspects

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 of sexual sins.

279
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 of sexual sins.

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Therefore,

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 the correct question is,

282
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 if what you are doing

283
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 is considered

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 sexual intimacy,

285
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 sexual intimacy,

286
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 if so,

287
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 I won't count everything,

288
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 it should be kept

289
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 within the boundaries of marriage.

290
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 it should be kept within the boundaries of marriage.

291
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Many times,

292
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 we see God's

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 teaching on this

294
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 as a set of rules.

295
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Therefore,

296
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 we try to ask

297
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 what the limit is.

298
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 We try to push the limit.

299
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 If you know the rules,

300
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 the teacher may have set some rules

301
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 in the classroom,

302
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 so don't make a fuss.

303
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 So don't make a fuss.

304
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Or, we like

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 to keep the rules

306
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 to the extreme

307
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 to the extreme

308
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 within the boundaries

309
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 and not to be punished.

310
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 It is like

311
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 when I was driving in the US,

312
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 the speed limit

313
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 was 70 miles per hour,

314
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 was 70 miles per hour,

315
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 per hour.

316
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 But if you don't exceed

317
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 15,

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 you won't be arrested.

319
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 So most people,

320
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 even though they know the speed limit is 70,

321
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 they still drive at 80 miles per hour

322
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 and don't exceed 85 miles per hour,

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 and they won't be arrested.

324
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 If you know the rules,

325
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 you will usually

326
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 try to push

327
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 the limit.

328
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So when you ask

329
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 if this is okay,

330
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 you are thinking

331
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 how to push the limit

332
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 to the extreme

333
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 so that God won't punish me

334
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 or if he thinks

335
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 it is okay.

336
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 But if

337
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 we look at God's laws

338
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 as

339
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 our advantage,

340
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 would we have

341
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 a second thought?

342
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 In the past,

343
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 we might ask

344
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 what I can do to the best of my ability

345
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 to not violate God's laws.

346
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 But actually,

347
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 as a Christian,

348
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 should we ask

349
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 how we can

350
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 get closer to Jesus

351
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 and make him happy?

352
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I will give you an example.

353
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Let's say I am a pastor

354
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 for 9 months.

355
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 When I was

356
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 studying at the church,

357
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 I would read

358
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 a lot of different books

359
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 and learn how to be a pastor.

360
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 If I am

361
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 a wise person,

362
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 I would not ask

363
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 how I can be a pastor

364
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 at the minimum.

365
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Is it okay to be a pastor

366
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 if I am a good student?

367
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Or should I learn

368
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 how to be a good pastor?

369
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 How do they behave?

370
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 How do they talk to their sisters?

371
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 How do they do their best

372
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 to learn the Bible

373
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 so that I can be

374
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 a better pastor?

375
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Or should I

376
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 barely

377
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 get a job

378
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 at the church?

379
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 If you are

380
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 a pastor

381
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 and you want me to

382
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 do my best

383
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 to make myself

384
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 a better pastor,

385
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 then

386
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 the same goes for God.

387
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 The Bible

388
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 has a lot of rules

389
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 and a minimum

390
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 requirement.

391
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 How far do we need to go?

392
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 God does not want us

393
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 to meet the minimum.

394
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 He wants us to use our lives

395
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 to glorify God

396
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 and to ask for His joy.

397
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 How can we live out more of

398
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 God's ways

399
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 instead of meeting the minimum?

400
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 If that is the case,

401
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 then why

402
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 do we need to

403
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 avoid sexual sins?

404
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 How do we see this

405
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 in God?

406
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Let's read

407
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 from verse 6 to 8.

408
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Let's read

409
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 in Chinese.

410
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 1, 2, 3

411
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 "No man

412
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 should be in this world

413
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 taking advantage of his brother.

414
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 For this kind of good

415
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 is a reward.

416
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 As I have warned you

417
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 before,

418
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 God does not want

419
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 us to be

420
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 in the way of sin,

421
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 but to make us

422
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 holy. Therefore,

423
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 he who abhors the teaching of this

424
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 is not an abhorrent man,

425
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 but an abhorrent one who

426
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 has his own spirit

427
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 in your hearts."

428
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 I think this is

429
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 one thing.

430
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 God

431
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 wants us to be holy.

432
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 He

433
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 bought us

434
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 with a heavy price.

435
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 He wants us to

436
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 live out holiness.

437
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 In verse 4 and 5,

438
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 we read

439
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 that Paul

440
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 specifically distinguished

441
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 the believers

442
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 from the unbelievers.

443
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 The unbelievers

444
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 would not know

445
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 God's

446
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 law and standards.

447
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 But the believers

448
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 clearly know that God

449
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 has told us how

450
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 we should live

451
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 lives of moral

452
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 sexual purity,

453
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 how to control our bodies,

454
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 how to be holy

455
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 and live honorably.

456
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 This is God's instruction

457
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 and calling.

458
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 He wants us to be holy.

459
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 His heart

460
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 is doing this

461
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 for our own good.

462
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 He doesn't want us to live a boring life

463
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 or a miserable life.

464
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 He calls us

465
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 to be like God

466
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 because he wants us

467
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 to be like God.

468
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Because he is holy.

469
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Have you ever thought about

470
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 why

471
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 sexual immorality

472
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 would take

473
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 the brother's side?

474
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Maybe you think,

475
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 "We are not married.

476
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 How can we

477
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 influence other brothers?"

478
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 "It's our own business."

479
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 But

480
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 the brother or sister

481
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 in your church

482
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 might marry

483
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 or marry someone

484
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 one day.

485
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 When you do this

486
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 to them,

487
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 you are taking

488
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 the brother or sister's

489
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 side.

490
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 You are taking

491
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 the brother's side.

492
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 This is

493
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 a kind of love.

494
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Not taking the brother's side

495
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 or loving the brother

496
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 or sister around you.

497
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Although this person

498
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 might not appear yet,

499
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 bear that in mind.

500
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 If you are not

501
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 in a relationship with

502
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 the person you are already married to,

503
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 you are taking the brother's side.

504
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 The Bible

505
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 clearly states

506
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 that such a person

507
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 will be punished.

508
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Paul said, "I am warning you."

509
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Third,

510
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 if

511
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 we don't avoid

512
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 the sin of sin,

513
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 we are rejecting God.

514
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Why?

515
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 In Columbus'

516
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 18-20,

517
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 another book,

518
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Paul clearly states

519
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 that we should avoid

520
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 the sin of sin.

521
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 We should flee from

522
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 sexual immorality.

523
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 We often wonder

524
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 whether sin is a big deal.

525
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 We can talk more about this

526
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 later.

527
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 But the sin of adultery

528
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 is a big deal.

529
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 All the sins

530
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 mentioned in this book

531
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 are physical.

532
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Only adultery

533
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 is harmful to our body.

534
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 If you know

535
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 that we are God-fearing,

536
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 that the Holy Spirit lives in our body,

537
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 when you harm your body

538
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 or let your body be unhealed,

539
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 you are actually

540
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 persecuting God.

541
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 You are sinning against God.

542
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 What is God doing to our body?

543
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 The Bible says

544
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 that God is

545
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 in your body.

546
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 So why

547
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 God values sexual sins?

548
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 We should avoid

549
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 sexual sins because they are God's

550
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 calling. He calls us to be holy.

551
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 He calls us to be His followers.

552
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 He calls us to be like Him.

553
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Second, if we don't do this,

554
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 we are taking advantage of

555
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 our brother.

556
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Third, if we don't do this,

557
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 we are actually

558
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 persecuting God.

559
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Because the Holy Spirit lives in our body.

560
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 It is in our body.

561
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 It is in our body.

562
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Practically,

563
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 how can we

564
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 live out

565
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 this holiness?

566
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 [translation]

567
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 [translation in Cantonese]

568
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 "For this is the gospel, that you become holy, that you keep away from sexual immorality"

569
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 [translation in Cantonese]

570
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 [translation in Cantonese]

571
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 [translation in Cantonese]

572
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,540
 控制得到,唔緊要,行近啲條紅線都得

573
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,700
 我到最後嗰度唔做神話唔做嗰樣嘢就得㗎啦

574
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:06,120
 但係有時我哋真係會高估咗自己嘅能力

575
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,620
 之前喺美國可能都真係會喺教會實習啦

576
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,580
 都有啲人會同我分享點解

577
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,800
 有啲年青人同我分享點解會發生咗呢

578
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,560
 好多都係唔知點解會發生咗

579
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,320
 亦都唔係想發生但係就係發生咗,總之唔知點解

580
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,980
 咁我諗畀我一個提醒或者係畀我哋多一個提醒啦

581
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:32,560
 就係其實唔好高估咗自己嗰個嘅能力啦

582
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,360
 有一個嘅小故事啦就係

583
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,020
 喺一個有一個人就諗住去一個鄉村旅行啦

584
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,820
 咁佢個去個小村落呢就要經過一個山嘅

585
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,280
 而個山路呢就係好窄嘅

586
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,200
 咁佢就去嘗試去僱用一個的士司機啦

587
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,820
 邊個的士司機真係要最安全咁樣

588
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,700
 經過好窄嘅山路去到嗰條村莊啦

589
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,360
 咁佢就喺度問唔同嘅司機喺度等緊乘客嘛

590
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,740
 第一個司機就問你你你揸呢條山路嘅時候

591
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,820
 你可以揸成點樣呀

592
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,160
 司機一呢就話

593
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,780
 我可以離開個懸崖一呎都唔會跌落去嘅

594
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,360
 所以你放心啦你僱用我啦

595
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,080
 第二個司機就講啦

596
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,360
 我仲勁呀我可以離開個懸崖六呎呀

597
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,440
 六吋呀都唔會跌落去

598
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,360
 都可以安全咁樣將你去送抵達目的地

599
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,160
 司機三呢就話

600
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,360
 我仲勁我可以離個懸崖一吋

601
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,700
 都唔會跌落去將你送去目的地

602
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,700
 最後有個司機講話

603
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:52,700
 我會去嘗試每一分每一秒都係離開個懸崖越遠越好

604
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:58,700
 咁我唔知你係會揀邊個司機去車你去個小村莊呢

605
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,700
 一呎嗰個六吋一吋都唔會出事嗰個

606
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,700
 定話係佢每一分每一秒都係會離開個懸崖

607
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,700
 接住個山邊去揸車嗰個司機呢

608
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,700
 喺我哋嘅context裏面

609
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,700
 逃避又係指緊啲乜嘢呢

610
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,700
 你明知道如果有啲嘢係會arouse到你嘅

611
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,700
 你就唔好去接觸佢啦

612
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,700
 我知道而家喺你哋嘅世代裏面係好難

613
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
 或者我哋嘅世代啦

614
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,700
 其實我都會接觸到嘅

615
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,700
 我學校佢就教話而家嘅porn呢

616
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,700
 好容易接觸到嘅無論係刊物定話係一啲media嘅嘢

617
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,700
 佢話有四個a呀而家點解咁容易呢比起

618
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,700
 我嘅年代或者我爸爸媽媽年代更容易接觸到嘅

619
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,700
 佢話四個a喎因為而家係more acceptable

620
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,700
 即係好平常嘅呢啲接觸呢啲嘢

621
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,700
 接觸咗即係或者你做呢樣嘢其實都冇乜所謂啦

622
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,700
 第二個呢就係第二個a就係accessible

623
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,700
 好容易access到嘅以前可能我哋都要去買啲cd呀

624
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,700
 或者dvd咁樣你要去出街嘅咁但係而家其實

625
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
 撳一個掣你就會已經access到㗎啦

626
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,700
 第三個嘢就係more affordable其實而家係好平就可以接觸到㗎啦

627
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,700
 第四就係anonymous你接觸到都冇人知暗暗地做

628
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,700
 其實而家你哋嘅人有比起以前嘅人係更大嘅

629
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,700
 所以你要知道乜嘢會arouse到你嘅

630
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,700
 你就唔好去接近呢啲嘢啦

631
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,700
 如果係你喺一段嘅關係裏面

632
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,700
 你避免即係兩個人係一個即係私人嘅空間裏面啦

633
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,700
 或者係即係你可以同啲其他一班嘅朋友出嚟啦

634
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,700
 就係囉避免兩個人喺個私人空間啦

635
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:01,700
 又或者係有即係一啲弟兄姊妹啦佢就話你去

636
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,700
 佢自己畀佢一個男仔嚟嘅佢就話平時

637
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,700
 佢讓我自己去健康啲啦去做多啲運動咁佢

638
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,700
 就可能唔會成日去諗呢一類嘅嘢啦

639
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,700
 如果喺一段關係裏面

640
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,700
 我唔知你可能會唔會去同你嗰個嘅

641
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,700
 Partner男女朋友去祈禱呢

642
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,700
 即係如果你每一次嘅約會完咗

643
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,700
 或者你每一次嘅傾電話完咗之後你去咁樣同佢一齊去祈禱啦

644
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,700
 我覺得係會係避免到呢一樣嘢嘅發生嘅

645
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,700
 之前有一個人就

646
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:53,700
 就有一次啦咁就畀咗條頸呢個啦

647
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,700
 就係一個十字架啦即係其實當你對方

648
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:04,700
 去帶住一個十字架頸鏈你對帶住十字架頸鏈佢又帶住十字架頸鏈嘅時候

649
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,700
 其實都係一個Reminder啦當你知道耶穌係喺呢個關係中間

650
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,700
 你就唔會去咁容易去行入呢啲嘅人有裏面啦

651
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,700
 最後就Irene牧師啦佢成日都話拍拖就要話畀佢聽

652
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,700
 咁呀所以你哋如果當中邊個即係係Explorer裏面拍拖啦你都可以話畀佢聽

653
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,700
 即係咁樣係有啲咩好處呢就係去Keep you accountable

654
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:33,700
 等牧者或者導師去知道你而家係一個Relationship裏面咁可能你都會有一個嘅警惕

655
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,700
 令到自己唔好去真係陷入喺呢啲嘅狀況裏面呀

656
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:45,700
 所以你可以去搵佢嘅到最後嘅一樣嘢啦

657
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,700
 真係想同大家分享就係其實有好多時呢我發現自己啦

658
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:58,700
 喺我嘅人生裏面通常我犯罪去Sin against God啦都係我想Please我自己多過去Please神

659
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:05,700
 而喺呢一段經文一開始就係我哋點樣可以行一個討神喜悅嘅修命呢

660
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:12,700
 可能你會覺得呢個教導真係好老土可能你會覺得過時可能你覺得唔明白或者唔同意

661
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:18,700
 但係你記得一樣嘢啦即係每一次你做一樣嘢嘅時候

662
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:24,700
 你係會想Please你自己多啲定Please神多啲呢

663
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:32,700
 其實神去設立一啲Standard畀我哋唔係想我哋唔開心唔係想我哋有個Miserable life

664
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,700
 而係佢知道呢一樣嘢係對我哋好

665
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,700
 雖然好多時我哋今日有啲嘢唔同意或者唔明白

666
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,700
 但係我都請你相信去遵從神同埋信佢係值得嘅

667
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:54,700
 因為神係我哋佢愛我哋佢知道比我哋更清楚知道乜嘢對我哋好

668
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,700
 而且佢心裏面時常都係有我哋嘅Best Interest喺度

669
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,700
 佢最清楚知道乜嘢我哋應該做同埋唔應該做

670
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:15,700
 所以今日即使你覺得係可能比較過時或者身邊嘅人覺得過時

671
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:26,700
 但係我哋做為一個群體都係去一齊去互相提醒大家去活出神嗰個嘅標準同埋佢嗰個嘅聖潔

672
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:33,700
 最後我知道今日講咗好多嘢啦即係關於Sexual Immorality 聖潔呢啲嘢

673
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:42,700
 或者我哋當中有人可能都真係做過一啲嘢心裏面你覺得內疚或者唔開心

674
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:49,700
 但係我覺得今日都想同大家講即使係有啲嘢你發生過嘅

675
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,700
 即係神同你講佢明白 and it's okay

676
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:02,700
 你做過嘅所有嘢我有一句好鍾意就係佢話

677
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,700
 There is nothing you have done that can make God love you more

678
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,700
 And there is also nothing you have done that can make him love you less

679
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,700
 無論你今日去做過啲乜嘢唔會阻礙神愛你有幾多

680
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,700
 亦都唔會阻礙神喺你生命裏面嗰個嘅旨意

681
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:29,700
 不過今日無論係乜嘢嘅狀況我都好想你去我哋一齊去 come to God and say

682
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:37,700
 即使你做過啦真係神呀真係係我以前去可能得罪過你真係犯過罪

683
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:46,700
 但係今日我願意去將我嘅關係我所有嘅desires去畀你去管理

684
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,700
 求主你去 guard my heart and protect me

685
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:59,700
 今日就係我對大家嘅勉勵其實好多時大家都知道聖經上嘅教導

686
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:05,700
 不過就可能好難喺我哋呢個世界上面去行出嚟

687
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,700
 大神呼召我哋去成為聖傑亦都係同世界唔一樣

688
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,700
 所以我哋就一齊去咁樣去為神擺上

689
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,700
 咁樣去一齊去努力去活出一個神喜悅嘅生命

690
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
 我哋一齊祈禱

691
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,700
 青天賦滿力感謝你去用重價去買我哋

692
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,700
 呼召我哋出嚟去成為聖傑

693
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,700
 去 be separated from the world

694
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,700
 主呀呢個係一個嘅恩典主求你去讓我哋去睇你嘅 rules

695
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:45,700
 唔係一啲去令我哋去 miserable嘅事情

696
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,700
 或者係令到我哋 to have a boring life

697
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,700
 但係呢個係神你係為著我哋嘅好處

698
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,700
 你比我哋更清楚明白乜嘢係對我哋好

699
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:02,700
 主呀就求你去讓我哋縱然可能有時有啲嘢唔同意

700
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,700
 或者縱然有時好多嘢唔明白

701
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,700
 但我哋都唔去懷疑你喺我哋生命裏面嗰份好

702
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,700
 你對我哋嘅旨意嗰個嘅好

703
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,700
 主呀都求你去幫助我哋 explore

704
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,700
 每一位都喺你裏面去活出聖結

705
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,700
 去過一個蒙你喜悅嘅生命

706
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,700
 主呀求你去真係去 guard our hearts

707
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,700
 同埋去 protect us from all the temptations

708
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,700
 In Jesus name we pray

709
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,700
 - Thank you.
