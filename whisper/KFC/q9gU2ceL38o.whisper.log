[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040]   I had my daughter ask me this morning during breakfast, she said, "Daddy, what does the
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.280]   Holy Spirit do now?"
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.440]   It was like a great breakfast topic discussion, right?
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.440]   Put her on Alpha.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.520]   Yes, just feeling, thank you Florence just for leading us in worship, just feeling just
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.680]   grateful to be here, to be able to just worship together, really feeling that the Holy Spirit
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.640]   is the one that sustains us and drives and allows us to even worship Him, to even know
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.640]   Him.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.960]   So it's really good that we get to be here for that.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.600]   And we're going through Old Testament women.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.840]   Old Testament women and Johnny last week went through Rebecca and today I'm going to go
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.420]   through Leah and Rachel, or Rachel and Leah depending which way you want to put it.
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.200]   Just to give you a little bit of context then.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.200]   So Rebecca, she has two boys and Johnny talked about this.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.280]   What are their names?
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.560]   Isa and Jacob.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.400]   Jacob the deceiver.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.640]   Jacob the one who tricks, steals the blessing.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.600]   And then eventually his mum says, "Okay, you've stolen the blessing, you've got what you want,
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.600]   it's time to go."
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.280]   So he heads off.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.160]   He heads off across the land, finds his mother's brother, Uncle Laban, Laban, and then he goes
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.960]   to find Laban, and then before he meets Laban, he meets Laban's daughter, Rachel, who's a
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.000]   shepherdess who works for the family.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.840]   And he falls in love with Rachel because she's beautiful.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.400]   And so he goes back, finds us, and they have this wonderful family reunion.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.000]   And then suddenly Laban says, "Hey, stay."
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.840]   And then Jacob says, "Yeah, I'll work for you."
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.200]   And then Laban's like, "Oh, I can't pay you nothing.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.160]   I've got to pay you something."
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.920]   And then that's when Jacob comes out with his big request.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.000]   "Let me marry your daughter.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.760]   Let me marry your beautiful daughter, and I will work for you for seven years."
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.160]   Seven years.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.120]   Just a little bit of context there.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.880]   There is such a thing as a dowry that is paid to parents when you marry their daughter,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.480]   and usually that's about three or four months' worth of wage.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.240]   He's saying, "I'm going to give you seven years."
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.620]   So that's how much he loved Rachel.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.320]   So then he works for Laban for seven years, but Scripture tells us this, and all of this
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.880]   is found in Genesis 29.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.360]   So you can turn there if you want to.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.200]   I will be flying around a little bit within these few pages.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.640]   Genesis 29, let's go with 29 verse 20.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.960]   So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.760]   Can you imagine seven years feeling like a few days?
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.040]   And then time comes.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.640]   He's like, "Laban, it's time for me to marry your daughter."
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.500]   And Laban's like, "Okay, you're right."
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.560]   So he organizes a feast, a party, everyone comes, they have a wonderful time, and then
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.300]   at nighttime, it's time for him to receive his bride.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.060]   But Laban pulls a sneaky.
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.560]   Instead of giving him Rachel, the beautiful one whom Jacob loved, at nighttime when Jacob
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.840]   was probably a bit drunk by then, he gives him Leah.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   Isn't that funny?
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   Jacob the deceiver.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.840]   Jacob who was the one who tricked to get his own blessing is now the one being tricked.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.840]   As you can see, deception runs through the family.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.720]   So then he wakes up in the morning thinking he's just had the most wonderful night with
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.120]   the woman of his dreams, and he wakes up to find Leah.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.520]   Now there's a difference here between the two, Rachel and Leah, and it's in chapter
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.080]   9, 29 verse 17.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.080]   Rachel was the younger one.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.720]   Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.000]   Now there's some discussion as to what eyes were weak means, but most likely it didn't
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.720]   mean that she couldn't see very far.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.600]   Probably that she had some kind of eye disorder.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.000]   Either way, she wasn't as beautiful as Rachel.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.080]   Rachel, on the other hand, was beautiful in form and appearance.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.000]   So not only was she beautiful in terms of her face, but she was sexually attractive.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.360]   She had the right form as well.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.800]   So Jacob is then absolutely distraught.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.120]   He's been tricked.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.160]   So then he goes to Laban and goes, "What have you done to me?"
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.480]   And then Laban says, "Hey, actually, in our custom, you can't marry the younger one first.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.060]   The older one has to go first.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.320]   So actually, if you want Rachel, you can still have her work for me for another seven years,
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.380]   and next week I'll give you Rachel."
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.520]   And because of his love for Rachel, he says yes.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.160]   And he ends up marrying both of them.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.360]   What a bad idea.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.360]   What a bad idea.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.160]   Speaking to Ruben, he was asking me what I'm preaching on today.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.960]   And I said, "Rachel and Leah."
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.240]   He said, "Oh, why does he have two wives?
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.240]   Why does he have more wives?"
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.240]   I'm like, "You know what?
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.240]   I don't know.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.240]   I don't know why anyone wants two wives.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.240]   One is more than enough."
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:01.880]   In fact, God felt that it was such a bad idea to have two wives, both being sisters.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.000]   In Leviticus 18, he tells these Israelites, "You will not marry sisters together."
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.440]   It was that bad an idea.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.280]   And why was it a bad idea?
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.720]   What happens after they get married is this interesting journey in chapter 29 and chapter
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.840]   30 of them basically having a race for kids.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.600]   You wonder where the wonderful holy nation, the 12 tribes of Israel come from.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.760]   They come from two sisters, basically trying to have as many kids as they could.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.800]   12 kids in total.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.520]   Leah starts the game off well, heads up 4-0.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.760]   She has four at first.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.680]   And then Rachel ends up catching up.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.760]   Rachel ultimately ends up having two.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   But Rachel then has some sneaky ideas to get some as well.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   And ultimately, you end up with 12.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.560]   And I'll tell you all about this story as we go through.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.920]   But this is a story of two sisters basically competing against each other, knowing each
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.920]   other all of their lives.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.400]   Who has siblings here?
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.640]   Have you competed with your siblings?
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.240]   Especially if one was more beautiful than the other.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.240]   The fact that I didn't have that problem.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:16.880]   I have a younger brother, but he was clearly the ugly one, so it was okay for me.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.320]   He's actually not even here, so he can't even defend himself.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.320]   But he really was.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.320]   He really was.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.240]   But anyway.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.800]   Can you imagine just for a second being Leah?
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.060]   Being the older one and having this young little baby come into the family that steals
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.960]   all the attention.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.840]   Then this young baby grows up into being the beautiful girl, whereas you're not as beautiful.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.320]   Whereas you're considered to have weak eyes.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.760]   All the aunties and uncles fawning over her, saying how beautiful she is.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.520]   All the guys in school looking at her and not you.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.320]   Eventually she is the one that gets picked.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.720]   But then your dad on the very last night says, "You go first."
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.960]   Imagine the shame, the embarrassment.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.120]   And then it doesn't stop there.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.680]   Imagine waking up that morning thinking, "At least I'm married now."
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.280]   But then for the guy to go, "What?
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.640]   What are you doing here?"
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:31.640]   And then in chapter 29 verse 21, when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, which probably
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.880]   meant that she was neglected.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:39.400]   So even though she was married and he took her in, he didn't give her any attention.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:48.080]   Imagine that feeling of just being overlooked or ignored, neglected and hated.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.280]   And then you look at Rachel, this beautiful girl growing up, no doubt.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.680]   Got all the attention from all the uncles and aunties, from all the boys.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.720]   Eventually gets the husband that's willing to work for 14 years for her.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.480]   And then you see as the story goes on, Rachel is not that happy either.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.040]   In fact, Rachel gets to a point where she doesn't get to have kids at the beginning.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:20.240]   She's barren at the beginning where she says in chapter 30 verse 1, she's angry at Jacob
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.280]   because Leah's 4-0 up.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.080]   And she said, "Why aren't you giving me kids?"
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.880]   And Jacob's like, "It's not my fault.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.800]   I'm doing the same thing.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.000]   And kids are happening over here.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   So it's something between you and God."
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.080]   And then she says, "Give me children or I shall die."
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:42.080]   This is Rachel, the one who had all the attention, who had all the love from the husband, who
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.760]   had all the looks.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.120]   And yet she was at a point where she said, "Give me children or I will die."
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.720]   You look at these two sisters, you look at their story and you wonder, what on earth
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.800]   happened?
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.640]   How did it get so bad?
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.680]   How did it get to the point where this whole family has been consumed by this issue?
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.200]   And what is this issue?
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.880]   What is the issue that plagued this whole family, all these two sisters?
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:16.760]   I think it's in chapter 30 verse 1, envy.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:23.600]   Scripture says that Rachel envied Leah because she had kids and she didn't.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:31.080]   One of the deadly sins, the desire to possess something that others have, envy.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.280]   But it's actually even worse than that.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.360]   It's not just wanting what they have.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.600]   There's a negative feeling.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.520]   It's if I can't have it, they can't either.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.280]   That's envy.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.840]   Scripture describes it as being intensely red.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:53.080]   It's this idea of just seeing what other people have, being completely discontent, resenting
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.640]   it.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.040]   And envy is everywhere.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.100]   It's funny, last time I preached here, I talked about money, sex, and power.
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.100]   And today I'm talking about envy.
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.840]   So I'm coming out with all the really positive, feel-good topics here.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.840]   But it's everywhere.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:12.840]   Money, sex, and power are a problem because of envy.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.400]   Because we're looking at other people going, "Oh, look how much money they have.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   Look.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   Oh, they have this kind of house.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.800]   Oh, they have this kind of wife.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.320]   This have this kind of life.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.600]   They have this kind of yacht."
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.680]   And then you wonder, that's where people are chasing after money.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.680]   Same with sex.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.340]   Same with power.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.280]   Envy is that deadly.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.800]   Envy is that dangerous.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.280]   And I wanted to focus basically on this topic today.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.140]   This topic of envy.
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:45.480]   And it's an interesting one, but there's really two questions I want to ask, and they're these.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.460]   How does it start and how can it end?
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.600]   How does it start and how can it end?
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.440]   We clearly see, we clearly know that envy is a problem, but how does it start and how
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.440]   can it end?
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.440]   And I'm going to focus on these by looking at the story of Rachel and Leah.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.800]   Let's start with how does it start.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.560]   I think it starts basically with four things.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.880]   And there are four components that basically drive this vicious cycle of envy.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.880]   They are comparison, discontentment, resentment, and manipulation.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.440]   Let's start with the first one, comparison.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:22.200]   Did you know that kids, when they turn seven years old, is when they first start to notice
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.480]   other people are different to them.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.960]   Up until then, their ignorance is bliss.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.920]   They're getting on with their own thing.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.960]   But at seven years old, researchers believe that's when they start looking at other kids
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.840]   in school and going, why does he have a phone?
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.560]   Why do I not?
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.560]   Oh.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.160]   I got this question asked to me.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.080]   Daddy, why doesn't our car door open like this?
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:51.120]   I was like, why would you want that?
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.800]   Our mode of transportation opens like this.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.160]   It's pretty much the same.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.720]   But it's around that age they start to compare.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.120]   They start to look and go, hmm, what's going on here?
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.800]   And that's exactly what happened with Rachel and Leah.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:10.080]   You see, Leah no doubt would have been compared to Rachel.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.160]   Rachel was comparing herself to Leah.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.740]   And you see, this is where the problem begins.
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.440]   This is where the seed of envy is planted.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.720]   When you look across at someone else and go, hmm, how do I compare to them?
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.880]   Do you do that?
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.760]   Did you do that with your siblings growing up?
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.720]   Did you do that with your school friends?
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:39.000]   Did you go to that kind of school where everyone's -- why do parents sign up to -- sign their
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.920]   kids up, their babies up to kindergarten before they're even born?
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.920]   It starts with comparison.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   Looking at, oh, that's what they do.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.920]   That's what they do.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.580]   Oh, that's -- that's how it begins.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.720]   Comparison is the beginning of envy.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.960]   And you can see here that Leah is looking at Rachel going, why does she get all the
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.960]   attention?
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.700]   Why is she the one who's loved?
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.200]   Why am I the one who's hated?
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.480]   And then you've got Rachel, who's beautiful, who has a husband, but she doesn't have kids.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:11.600]   And back in those days, to have kids for a woman is the most important thing.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.880]   And so she is at the point where she's like, I need kids or otherwise there's no point
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.440]   in living anymore.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.120]   Comparison is the beginning of envy.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.960]   And I want to tell you another story that really highlights this.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.320]   It's in 1 Samuel 18.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.760]   And we've all heard about David and Goliath.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.120]   David, this little boy, the shepherd, defeats this huge giant.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.240]   And then Saul, of course, welcomes him in.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   And then it gets to the point where they conquer other nations.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.840]   And as they're heading home, something fascinating happens.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.240]   And I want to take you to turn, if you can, to 1 Samuel 18.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.160]   So they've just defeated Goliath, they've defeated some other people, and they're on
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160]   their way home.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.640]   And as they are heading home, they're heading home back to their city.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:04.400]   They are met with singing and dancing, tambourines, songs of joy with musicians.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.600]   And the women sang to one another.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.040]   And what did they sing?
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.600]   They sang this interesting line.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   And it was this.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.440]   "Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands."
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.120]   Actually, it was just an innocent song.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   It was poetry.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.200]   Because, of course, David didn't kill ten thousands compared to Saul's thousands.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.480]   It was just a way of singing.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.720]   But Saul then got very angry.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.040]   And this saying displeased him.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.400]   He said, "They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me only thousands.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.440]   What more can he have but the kingdom?"
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.880]   And here's the verse.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.320]   1 Samuel 18, verse 9.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.560]   "And Saul eyed David from that day on."
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.320]   Envy began through comparison.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.200]   And I want us to reflect on this.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.480]   Do we compare ourselves to other people?
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:04.280]   Do we measure ourselves, our worth, to what other people are doing?
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.600]   Comparison is the beginning.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.320]   Other comparison, of course, then leads to discontentment.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320]   Because why?
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.680]   You're looking at other people and looking at what they do.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.920]   And social media is the best.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.800]   I'm sure I've said this before as well.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.960]   You scroll through social media.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.360]   Actually, I've recently felt this.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.480]   So I took time off social media for Lent.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.760]   And then when I went back, I realized I was starting to feel FOMO.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.760]   What's FOMO?
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.760]   Do you know?
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.760]   Fear of missing out.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.760]   I was lucky.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.240]   I was like, "Oh, they're going here.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.160]   Oh, they're hanging out.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.800]   Oh, they're at this beach.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.080]   Oh, they're sipping cocktails at this beach."
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.520]   Inadvertently, I'm comparing my life to theirs.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:52.480]   Because whilst I'm looking at their Instagram story of being on a beach, what am I doing?
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.360]   I'm on the toilet.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.080]   I'm comparing my life to theirs.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.760]   And it's not a great place where I am, but it looks like it's a very nice place where
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.600]   they are.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.520]   And then if you're not careful, that comparison leads to discontent.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.040]   It leads to you not being happy about anything that you have.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.600]   You see, the problem with envy is this.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.160]   It's a thief.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.080]   It robs you of joy.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:24.640]   I want to fast forward in Genesis now where Rachel finally has kids.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.120]   She has -- okay.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.240]   Leah is 4-0 up.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.200]   You're keeping track.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.160]   Rachel gets very upset.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.720]   How's it go at Jacob?
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.840]   Jacob's like, "Nothing I can do."
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.200]   Rachel then takes matters into her own hands and says, "Okay.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.680]   In that case, I'll give you my servant.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.320]   And if she has babies, they can be on behalf of me."
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.040]   So then she actually has two through the servant.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.240]   Leah sees it and goes, "Oh, then I'll do it as well."
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.760]   So then she gives her Jacob his -- like, "Jacob, what is he doing?"
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.600]   Anyway, so -- and then gets the servant and then has another two.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.600]   Finally, finally, finally, at the very end, Rachel does have a kid.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.480]   What's his name?
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.880]   Joseph.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.200]   Number 11.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.400]   And you think at that moment, that will be it.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.800]   Oh, finally, the Lord has answered my prayer.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.720]   I am satisfied.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.760]   I am happy.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.000]   I have what I need.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.200]   She doesn't.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.520]   What does she say at the end of chapter 30?
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.320]   "Then God remembered Rachel and God listened to her and opened her womb.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.320]   She conceived and bore a son and said, 'God has taken away my reproach.'
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:33.120]   And she called his name Joseph, saying, 'May the Lord add to me another son.'"
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.720]   So even though she finally got her son, what was the first thing on her mind?
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.840]   "I need another one."
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.720]   Discontent.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.320]   Envy leads to discontent.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.360]   It is a thief.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.200]   It steals joy from you.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.760]   It robs you of your relationships.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:56.200]   It robs you of your healthy marriages because you're looking -- you're always looking at someone else.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.120]   You're always trying to find something that's better than what you have.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.320]   The grass, apparently, is always greener.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.400]   And what does that mean?
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.920]   That means you're never happy with your piece of grass.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.000]   And Scripture tells us this.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.400]   Paul talks to Timothy and says, "Godliness starts with being content."
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   Starts with being happy with what God's given you.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.800]   Because what are you doing when you are discontent?
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.720]   You're saying, "God, you don't really love me.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.520]   You don't know what I need.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.000]   And I don't really trust you because I'm not happy with what you've given me."
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.920]   That's what discontent is, right?
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.400]   And that is directly opposed to godliness.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.120]   So comparison and then discontent.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.200]   And you see, it all ends up being chasing after the wind.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.480]   Rachel had the love of a husband but wanted kids.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.760]   Leah didn't have the love of a husband but really wanted it.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.960]   You can see the first few kids she has.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.560]   Reuben, Simeon and Levi.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.240]   What does she call them when she has them?
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.480]   This is the end of 29.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.360]   When she has Reuben, she says, "Ah, because the Lord has looked upon my affliction,
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.440]   for now my husband will love me."
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.440]   "For now my husband will love me.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.160]   Now that I've got him his first son, now my husband will love me."
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:18.040]   So even though she got this gift, she's still saying, "Oh, now I have this baby.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.840]   Maybe now Jacob will give me some attention.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.280]   Maybe now he'll love me like he loves Rachel."
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.560]   That's what she felt when she had her first baby.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.400]   And then she had her second one.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.520]   And she says, "Oh, the Lord has heard that I'm hated.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.440]   And now this time my husband will be attached to me."
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.760]   So time and time again, first baby, Reuben.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.120]   Second baby, Simeon.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.040]   Third baby, Levi.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.440]   Every time she's saying, "Thank God for this.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.560]   He's listened to me.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.800]   Now Jacob will love me."
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.120]   Can you feel that hurt in Leah?
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.120]   That that's what she felt?
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.800]   That having the kid was all still about chasing after her husband's affections?
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.600]   You see, the problem is, Rachel and Leah really both had the same problem,
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.320]   which is that they were both placing all their hopes on this one man.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:13.000]   They were both trying to get satisfaction and validation from this one person.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.040]   But the problem is, you always are left disappointed.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.280]   You always are left disappointed.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.960]   What you thought was going to be good for you, it doesn't deliver.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.000]   Tim Keller has this slightly honest and brash way of maybe putting this.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.960]   And of course, we appreciate who Rachel and Leah are.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:39.160]   And he says, "What you think you've got, what you think you have,
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:44.440]   you go to bed with Rachel, you wake up the next morning and it's Leah.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.000]   What you thought would be very good for you, those friends, that job,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.360]   that car, that yacht, you think you're going to bed with Rachel at night
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:58.160]   because you're fully satisfied now, but you wake up and it's Leah.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.080]   You wake up and you realise it wasn't what you thought it would be."
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.320]   Discontent is all a chasing after the wind.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.600]   Anything of this world, if you are putting your hope in it,
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:13.400]   if you are trying to earn your security in it, it will disappoint you.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.520]   That's what envy does.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.160]   That's why God thought it was so serious that he would make it a commandment.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.320]   Do not covet.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.440]   What is he saying?
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.040]   He's saying, "Don't do it."
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.720]   Not because it's not fun, not because it's not a pleasurable experience.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.440]   He's saying, "If you do it, it will rob you of joy.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.240]   It will rob you of peace."
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:38.520]   Charles Swindoll was the one who said, "Envy is the great enemy of peace."
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.840]   Do you have peace?
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.640]   Do you have inner peace?
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.440]   And if you don't, at least it's worth the question.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.160]   Is there envy in your heart?
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.080]   Are you comparing your situation to those around you?
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:04.160]   And this city is just incredible for that.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.760]   Do you have peace?
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.080]   If you don't, is it because there is envy in your heart?
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.000]   Are you comparing?
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.920]   Are you discontent?
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:19.840]   See, what happens with this is you're discontent.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.400]   But then it leads to resentment.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.560]   Now, resentment is an even more negative one, you could say.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.600]   In the middle of chapter 30, in verse 14, it says this,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.400]   "In the days of wheat harvest, Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.480]   and brought them to his mother, Leah.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.880]   Then Rachel said, 'Hey, please give me some of your son's mandrakes.'
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:46.040]   Reuben brought them in, this plant, 'Can your son give me some of them?'"
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.440]   And what does Leah say?
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.200]   She says, "You've taken my husband and now you want my mandrakes?"
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.880]   A little bit of an overreaction, but you can see the resentment.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.840]   You can see the resentment that would have no doubt built up
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.800]   all the way from the moment Rachel was born.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.120]   And then, of course, the resentment that Rachel has
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.720]   when she asks for children, otherwise she would die.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.080]   You see, resentment is, again, that same thing.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:17.120]   If I can't have it, neither can they.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:23.920]   Researchers say that 80% of criticisms find their root in envy.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.400]   So when people are criticizing other people,
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.440]   a lot of it is really rooted in envy.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   There's a National Health Institute of Japan, they did a study on envy,
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   and they found this, they found it was really interesting.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.280]   They studied the brain, and they studied the pain nodules
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.240]   that existed in the brain, and they found that
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.680]   when someone is experiencing envy, the same pain nodules
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.080]   as when you are suffering from physical pain are activated.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.360]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.960]   But when you're facing a physical pain, because someone's maybe punching you
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.200]   or whatever it is, or you get a paper cut,
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:07.960]   the same part of your brain is activated as when you're feeling envy.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.320]   So you associate it with pain.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.320]   What's even more interesting is this.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:18.760]   When the participants were shown an image of someone that they envied
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:25.040]   going through suffering, which part of the brain was activated?
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.280]   The pleasure centers.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.680]   When they saw someone that they envied going through suffering,
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   their pleasure centers woke up.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.120]   They felt pleasure from it.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.480]   Isn't that terrifying?
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.240]   Isn't that why we read, I mean I personally don't,
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:53.720]   why we read news websites like TNZ and any gossip places?
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.360]   When we're looking at other people that we might actually envy,
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.480]   and we see them screw up and mess up their lives,
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.920]   it brings us pleasure.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.360]   That's envy, brothers and sisters.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.080]   That's us comparing.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.360]   That's us not being content.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.360]   That's us being resentful.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.560]   Envy is that dangerous.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.800]   And it doesn't stop there, because you see the problem is this.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:26.880]   A problem that starts with envy never ends with just envy.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   It doesn't just stay there.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.800]   Now it's dangerous because it's hidden.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.880]   When you're envying someone, it's all hidden.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.600]   You don't see it appear physically.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.600]   But it's dangerous.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.800]   It's hidden in that sense.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.960]   But then what starts with envy never ends with envy,
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.800]   because it often leads to something else.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.080]   Look at the very first human that was ever born, Cain.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.480]   What led him to be a murderer?
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.800]   Envy.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.800]   You see, the problem is this.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.880]   We start with comparison, then we move to discontentment,
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.800]   then we move to resentment, and finally we move to manipulation.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.680]   Now I was trying to figure out what word to use here,
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.080]   because it's kind of manipulation.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.880]   I kind of wanted to use the word action,
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.200]   but it's more than that.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   So I ended up with manipulation, because it's this.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.760]   When you envy, when you compare yourself,
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   when you don't trust God,
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.160]   when you're not happy with what God's given you,
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.200]   what do you do?
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.080]   You take matters into your own hands.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.200]   You manipulate the situation.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.560]   So what happened with Rachel?
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.800]   She saw that she couldn't have kids.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.120]   So then she gives her servant to have kids.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.320]   And then when the servant had kids,
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.800]   she still wasn't happy enough.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.600]   And that's where the story about the mandrakes comes back in.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.640]   She sees Reuben, Leah's son,
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.200]   come back with these mandrakes, which is a plant.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.400]   But what kind of plant?
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.000]   It's a fertility plant.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.560]   They believe that if you ate these mandrakes,
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.120]   you would have kids.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.080]   So she's taking matters into her own hands.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.080]   It's an interesting fact, right?
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.520]   Or another interesting fact,
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.200]   Leah and Rachel actually means cow and ewe,
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.680]   like baby sheep, E-W-E.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.280]   What kind of man would call their daughter cow?
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.880]   Anyway, apparently herdsmen families would do that.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.280]   They would name their children after whatever, anyway.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.520]   These mandrakes were basically a fertility plant.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.400]   So Rachel's saying, "If only I could eat this plant.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.240]   If only I could have this, this could give me babies."
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.360]   And yet what happens?
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.320]   Leah's like, "What?
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.120]   You took my husband and now you want my plants?"
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.720]   And then Rachel says, "Okay, fine.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.000]   Give me your plants and I'll give you Jacob for one night."
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.840]   That was a deal.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.520]   And then they're like, "Deal."
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.960]   And so Jacob comes home from work
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.080]   and Rachel go, "Oh, you're with her tonight."
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.080]   And he's like, "Oh, okay, I'm with her."
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.120]   Doesn't paint a good picture for men, does it really?
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.480]   And what happens?
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.200]   Even though she got the mandrakes,
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.840]   who ended up having the next two boys?
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.680]   Leah.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.200]   So she tried to manipulate the situation,
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.120]   tried to use her servants, tried to get the mandrakes,
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.800]   yet still Leah was the one that had the babies.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:08.400]   Manipulation, us taking matters into our own hands.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.800]   Can you think of a time recently
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.360]   where maybe you took matters into your own hands?
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.160]   Whether it's in your personal life, family,
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.520]   romantic life, professional life,
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.200]   where you decided, "You know what?
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.160]   I know God promised me.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.800]   I know there's that song, 'He's Sovereign'
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.640]   and his plans to make us prosper are still there,
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.080]   but I'm just gonna do it myself."
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.360]   Have you had that?
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.280]   'Cause if you have, retrace your steps.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.400]   Was there resentment?
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.440]   Was there discontent?
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.440]   Was there comparison?
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.240]   Was there envy?
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.120]   Because envy, brothers and sisters, is dangerous.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.040]   As a really interesting quote,
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.640]   "Envy is the daughter of pride,
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.600]   the author of murder and revenge,
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.360]   the begetter of secret sedition,
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.920]   the perpetual tormentor of virtue."
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.680]   What starts with envy rarely ends with envy.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.640]   And it's something that we need to address.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.520]   It's something that we really need to get to the root of.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.920]   It's important because otherwise,
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.320]   it's this never-ending cycle.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.320]   Whatever you're doing right now,
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.440]   you're just chasing these things.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.400]   It's just constantly chasing after something
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.840]   that will never satisfy you.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.120]   You'll always be asking for more.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.080]   Another interesting quote is this,
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.040]   "A man will do many things to get loved,
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.600]   but he will do all things to get himself envied."
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.400]   See, the problem about social media is,
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.440]   and I love social media,
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.480]   there's great things that happen with it,
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.640]   so I'm not here just to slander social media,
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.800]   is yes, it contributes to this perpetual cycle of envy.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.400]   'Cause if we think back to ourselves,
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.200]   I mean, we're looking at other people's nice stuff,
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:59.760]   but we're also posting our own nice stuff, right?
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.360]   We're also trying to put our best foot forward.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.600]   What are we trying to do?
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.040]   Whilst we're envying others,
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.120]   we're also wanting others to envy us.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.440]   And that's how this cycle is fed,
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.720]   because we're always wanting to be validated.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.360]   We're always wanting to be looked up to.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.040]   We're always wanting to be liked.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.240]   We're always wanting to be envied.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.520]   And that's a matter of the heart that is deep.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.600]   That's a matter that we need to search ourselves and ask,
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.560]   God, is there any offensive way in me?
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.560]   Is there any offensive way in me?
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.000]   Do I envy in any way?
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.080]   'Cause I see how dangerous it could be.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.560]   Now, you may not be so envious to the point
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.880]   where you're gonna be going out to kill someone,
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.800]   but you can see the steps that it takes you down.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.240]   It's important for us to ask the question then,
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.720]   how can it end?
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.520]   We know how it starts, but how can it end?
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.280]   And of course, it's not really a cop-out,
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.760]   but I guess it kind of is.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.640]   The answer, of course,
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.520]   is that we can't put an end to it ourselves.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.000]   It all comes back to God.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Envy may start with us, but it has to end with God.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.120]   It has to.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.040]   It has to have us putting our eyes back onto him.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.400]   And we see that in the story of Rachel and Leah,
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.800]   because to battle the comparison, the discontentment,
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.920]   the resentment and the manipulation,
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.120]   we see that through this journey, this very flawed journey,
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.960]   this is God using imperfect people
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.960]   to carry out his perfect plan.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.560]   Did you know that this is how the 12 tribes of Israel
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.640]   was formed?
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.400]   Because these two ladies, these two sisters,
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.720]   were having a baby battle.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.440]   And yet these end up being the 12 tribes of Israel.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.520]   And then we see here is that
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.680]   even though all this stuff was happening,
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.920]   even though it was plagued with envy,
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.320]   God is always still there.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:08.680]   God is always still present, because 29 verse 31,
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.200]   "When the Lord saw that Leah was hated."
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.920]   In order to fight the comparison,
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.720]   we need to remember that God sees.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   God sees you.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.960]   You might feel like Leah, you might feel overlooked.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.760]   You might feel neglected.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.680]   You might feel that everyone is constantly
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.640]   looking somewhere else,
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.520]   but here's what scripture is telling you.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:37.000]   Here's what this story is telling you, that God sees you.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.640]   Leah, no doubt, had to battle this
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.520]   from the beginning of her life.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.680]   Maybe you have too.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.760]   But I feel it's important for me to tell you
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.800]   that God sees you.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.160]   He knows you and he loves you.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.520]   So there is no need for you to compare.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.400]   He's not looking at you and so-and-so.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.360]   He's not comparing you to so-and-so.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.400]   He sees you for who you are.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.360]   And you were fearfully and wonderfully made by him.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.400]   So there is no need to compare.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.600]   Stay in your lane.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.760]   Stay and be who God has called you to be
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.520]   because his eyes are on you.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.400]   He sees you.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.120]   Fast forward to the end, towards the end of chapter 30,
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.800]   well, verse 22, you see three things that God finally does.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.200]   Chapter 30, verse 22 says this,
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.240]   "Then God remembered Rachel and God listened to her
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.000]   "and he opened her womb and he gives her a baby."
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.280]   So the second one is this,
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.080]   not only does he see, he remembers.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.840]   Now, remember isn't like, oh, God forgot about you.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.360]   Oh, oh, oh, sorry, Leah, you're there.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.240]   Oh, oh, Rachel, I didn't realise you existed.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.480]   No, it's not that.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.240]   What the Bible means when it says remember,
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.120]   it means he cares for you.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.800]   He shows concern for you.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.400]   He knows what's best for you
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.240]   and he is keen to provide what you need.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.640]   So you don't need to have any discontentment in your heart.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.040]   You don't need to feel as though you don't have enough
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.600]   because you do, that song we sang,
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.800]   all we have is Christ and that is really enough.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.880]   God remembers you.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.080]   God knows your plight.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.320]   He knows the struggles.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.840]   He knows all these things,
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.360]   but he sees you and he remembers you.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.120]   So don't compare and be content.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.480]   In who you are and what he's given you
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.240]   and who he's made you to be.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.600]   And not only does he see you and remember you,
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.560]   he listens to you.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.960]   He answers prayer.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.440]   He desires connection.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.040]   He wants you to talk to him about these things.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.880]   He wants you to share your life with him
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.280]   because he sees you, he remembers you,
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.840]   and he listens to you.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.200]   And he is never late and he is never insufficient.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.880]   His grace is always sufficient for you.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.400]   Peter says, "Those who think the Lord is being slow,
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.400]   "he's not, because to him, a thousand years is like a day
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.720]   "and a day is like a thousand years."
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.600]   But he knows what's best for you.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.080]   So stay the course, keep in step with him.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:23.000]   Don't rush ahead, but just trust him.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.880]   Trust him that his timing is right,
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.160]   that he is always on time.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.280]   And finally, he opens up a room.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.320]   He is the one who gives,
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.680]   regardless of what Rachel and Leah do.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:39.280]   He is the one that gives the kids.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.520]   Isn't it interesting that God promises Abraham
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.040]   that he will be a father of nations.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.040]   Yet even in that family, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.960]   there is the issue of fertility.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.960]   Isn't that ironic, almost?
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.720]   But it's almost like God saying,
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.280]   "I've given you this promise,
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.600]   "but you need to stay close to me.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:07.600]   "No mandrakes, no eating of vegetables will get you babies.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:14.400]   "Trust me, I see you, I remember you, I'm listening to you,
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.200]   "and I will give as I see fit."
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.560]   It is the Lord who always gives.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.800]   And of course, we're talking about babysitting,
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.920]   but we can apply that to any situation that we have.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.600]   Whatever you feel as though you're waiting for,
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.520]   whatever you feel as though you need to manipulate for,
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.080]   that you need to take matters into your own hands for.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.880]   God's saying, "Let go.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.640]   "If you truly knew who I was,
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.920]   "you would know that I know what you need."
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.840]   Matthew 7 talks about that, right?
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.240]   "Ask and you shall receive."
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.080]   Why?
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.320]   Because if an earthly father knows what good gifts to give,
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.080]   God, of course, knows what you need.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.040]   So trust him.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.520]   So trust him.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.920]   But you may ask, "Hmm, sounds good,
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.320]   "but why should I trust him?
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:09.320]   "Is he really gonna give me what I need?"
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.360]   You see, I think God is patient,
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.800]   and he teaches us in his own time.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.200]   And I think Leah was starting to get the idea.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.360]   I told you about the three kids
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.920]   that she had at the beginning.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.240]   And each time she named them and then said,
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.000]   "Maybe my husband will love me now."
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.160]   By the fourth kid, something interesting happens.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.840]   By the fourth kid, she names him Judah.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:40.800]   But she says, "This time, I will praise the Lord."
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:47.200]   Can you see the change in her heart?
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.480]   The first three times, she's like,
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.520]   "Oh, if I have this kid, if I do what I can,
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.360]   "my husband will love me,
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.760]   "I'll get all the satisfaction I need
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.240]   "and all the safety I need."
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.160]   But no, she didn't get it until the fourth kid.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:02.280]   And the fourth kid, Judah, she says,
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.840]   "This time, I think I get it.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.760]   "This time, I will praise the Lord."
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.000]   And what happens after that?
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.600]   The 12 tribes of Israel, of course,
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.400]   ends up carrying on, carrying on
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.640]   to being the person of Jesus.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.520]   Jesus Christ himself, the Messiah,
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.720]   comes from this tribe, this mess.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.720]   And who does he come from?
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.560]   Judah.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:37.560]   He doesn't come through Rachel, the most loved wife,
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.080]   the most beautiful wife.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.280]   Doesn't come through Joseph,
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.040]   who he ends up using for mighty things.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.160]   He comes through Leah and Judah.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.960]   Isn't that fascinating?
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.760]   Do you realise that we all sit here,
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.240]   saved because of what Jesus did,
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.160]   because Jacob slept with Leah?
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.920]   Not Rachel, Leah.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:09.080]   Can you see how God used imperfect people,
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.880]   filled with envy, comparison, discontentment,
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.680]   resentment and manipulation,
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.760]   but ended up bringing about a saviour
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.600]   through their mistakes.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.840]   That through the line of Judah,
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:28.320]   son of Leah, the unloved and hated and ugly Leah,
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:33.800]   Jesus himself, deeply despised, rejected,
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.240]   yet ends up saving mankind.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.920]   Can we just ponder on that for a moment,
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.880]   that God would use such a plan to rescue us?
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.840]   I wanna finish with this one final story.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.160]   I talked about David and Goliath,
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.760]   and I feel as though this gives us a real answer to envy.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:01.200]   A practical one that we can kind of hold on to.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.840]   See, whilst he beats Goliath, he comes home,
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.520]   the ladies sing this song that basically gets into trouble,
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.560]   and then Saul ends up chasing him and trying to kill him.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.360]   In the middle of that, or just before that,
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.480]   in the beginning of chapter 18,
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.840]   it talks about David and Jonathan's friend.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.160]   Who's Jonathan?
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.960]   Jonathan is Saul's son.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.560]   And what happens is David beats Goliath,
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.400]   is introduced to the royal family,
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.080]   and ends up striking up a friendship with Jonathan.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.480]   But then Jonathan's dad, Saul, starts to get envious,
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.840]   starts to chase down his son's friend, David.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.440]   But scripture says something fascinating here,
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.560]   which he says, "But then Jonathan made a covenant
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.040]   "with David because he loved him as his own soul."
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.840]   And I think this is the remedy to envy, love.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.960]   Because what happens here?
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.560]   Can you imagine Saul is envying David?
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.320]   It would make a lot of sense
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.280]   if Jonathan was envying David as well, right?
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.720]   'Cause this is the guy, Jonathan's supposed to be king soon
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.520]   whenever his dad kicks the bucket.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.240]   But now you've got this guy, this David,
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.680]   who could take your throne.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:21.080]   Jonathan should, by worldly standards, be envying David,
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:24.000]   completely trying to trample over him, destroying him.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.640]   Yet scripture tells us here, he loves him as his own soul.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.120]   And then here's the next verse.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.920]   "And Jonathan strips himself of the robe that was on him
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.360]   "and gave it to David."
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.920]   So he sees this young man brought in,
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.960]   defeating this Philistine for his father.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.200]   He should be nervous.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.960]   He should be like, "Oh, who is this guy?
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.400]   "Is he gonna take my place as king?"
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.240]   But instead, when he sees David,
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.840]   when he builds up this friendship with him,
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.640]   he takes off his robe and covers David,
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:57.880]   showing no sign of comparison,
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.680]   no sign of discontent or resentment,
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.400]   no manipulation in any way.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.360]   He takes off his own robe and gives it to David.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.880]   Isn't that the solution to envy, to love?
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.640]   And here's the key, and this is where I'll finish.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.760]   What Jonathan did for David that day,
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.040]   seemingly small thing of taking off his robe
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.040]   and putting it onto David,
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.440]   is the same thing that Jesus Christ did for you.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:32.840]   Jesus Christ, the Prince of Heaven,
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:37.640]   saw you ugly and ashamed,
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:44.040]   and yet he took off his robes and put them over you.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.040]   If you let that truth seep into your heart,
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.400]   how could you possibly envy?
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:59.720]   If you knew who Jesus was and how much he loved you
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.480]   and what he gave for you,
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.320]   and that all you need can be found in him,
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:11.680]   you have his robe on right now, brothers and sisters.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.560]   How could you possibly envy?
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:19.560]   You have all you need in Jesus.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.280]   And that's my final prayer for all of us,
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.160]   because I don't even need a show of hands.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.200]   We all struggle with envy.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.240]   We all struggle with comparison,
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.840]   being discontent, being resentful,
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.280]   taking matters into our own hands.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.720]   But we all would do well to remember
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.280]   what Jonathan did for David,
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.800]   what Jesus did for us.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:51.080]   So whenever we're faced with the temptation again of envy,
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:56.080]   we can say, "No, this time I will praise the Lord.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:02.240]   This time I will look to God who is sovereign,
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.440]   who is enough."
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.360]   Let's pray.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.720]   (pastor and congregation murmuring)
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:20.680]   Jesus, we bow our heads before you.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:26.040]   I guess if we put it like that,
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.680]   it is really quite ridiculous that we still envy,
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:35.680]   that we still get caught up in the patterns of this world.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:41.000]   We find it so easy to compare ourselves to other people,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.400]   to be unhappy with what we have.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:48.440]   And yet we remember today what you did for us.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:52.720]   And we hold on, we cling on to the fact
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.800]   that Jesus, that is enough.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:45:01.120]   Forgive us, Lord, for forgetting about your act of love.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.120]   And give us the strength to comprehend
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:13.480]   the depth, the breadth, the length,
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.320]   and the height of your love for us.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.480]   Because when we get it, when we know it,
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:23.040]   there is no need to compare.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:27.440]   We remember that we all fall short,
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.280]   but are all justified freely by you.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.600]   So I wanna just spend a few moments now,
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.120]   as I've been doing a lot of talking,
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.320]   but I pray that the Spirit has allowed you to hear this,
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.640]   and that it would seep into your hearts.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:55.240]   And I pray that the Spirit will highlight to you
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.680]   if there are any seeds of envy,
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:03.720]   and give you the strength to let go.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:08.640]   Give you the strength to remember that He sees you,
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.760]   right where you are.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.440]   He remembers, He shows concern for you.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.680]   He is listening to the cries of your heart.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:26.560]   And He will give, and He will come through.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:31.560]   Trust Him, because He is enough.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.140]   (gentle music)
