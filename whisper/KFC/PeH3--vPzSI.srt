1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
 And it's great to be able to speak to you about God's Word tonight.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,420
 And we're finishing off the Book of Judges.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,980
 It's been really awesome, actually, to see how God has been working in the Old Testament

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:26,340
 and working in and through specific people to deliver His message and to deliver Israel.

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,360
 And last week, Pastor James went through a very difficult passage about the moral mess

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,220
 of Israel, Part 1, unfaithful worship.

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:42,120
 And Pastor James challenged us, you know, what is our motive to repentance?

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,060
 What is our motive to worshiping God?

9
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,500
 What is our motive to serving God?

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:59,960
 And as we see, as Israel denies God as their king and is involved in all sorts of idolatry,

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,100
 they become more and more morally decay, more and more morally decay.

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:13,340
 And we're going to see even more of that today as we look at Part 2, which is unfaithful

13
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,100
 acts.

14
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,060
 And we've been going through the Book of Judges, and we're seeing these similarities, this

15
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,340
 cycle that Israel has been going through.

16
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:28,220
 So they are caught up in idolatry, and their sin in their life.

17
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:36,680
 And maybe they're worshiping Baal, maybe they're caught up in adultery and affairs and unfaithful

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,420
 to the Lord, doing all sorts of lawless things.

19
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,860
 And then what happens is God punishes them.

20
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,680
 There's oppression.

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,800
 God sends other nations to oppress them.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,180
 The Philistines or other nations to come and punish them.

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,700
 And Israel cries out to God, "God, please deliver us.

24
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,700
 We repent."

25
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,260
 And Israel repents, and God sends a deliverer.

26
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:09,740
 Usually it's a judge like Samson or others, Deborah, to come and save them.

27
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,940
 And there's a period of peace.

28
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,820
 But here we see in Chapter 19 that there is no judge.

29
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,980
 God does not deliver a judge.

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,680
 And what happens is that Israel falls into moral decay.

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,920
 Their sense of right and wrong becomes rotten.

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
 Just like this apple.

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,700
 Who wants to eat this apple?

34
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,700
 The rotten one.

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,820
 Anybody want to eat it?

36
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,900
 I don't think I want to eat it, right?

37
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,780
 And that's what happens.

38
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,500
 Rotten apples, they're smelly, they're like mushy.

39
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,780
 Michelle doesn't want to eat it, even though she loves fruit.

40
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,620
 You know, like, we don't want to do anything with it.

41
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,220
 And that's what happened with Israel.

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,060
 Their sense of morality, right and wrong, is decaying.

43
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,060
 Imagine that.

44
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,100
 Imagine that smell of that rotten apple.

45
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,500
 That is Israel's moral decay.

46
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,460
 And so we go into Chapter 19.

47
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:17,180
 And now I must warn you, there are a lot of R-rated stuff in this passage.

48
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,380
 And so it might not be for everyone.

49
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,580
 But however, the Bible puts it there for a reason.

50
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,060
 And I believe that the Lord has a lesson for us today.

51
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,320
 So let us read Judges Chapter 19.

52
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:38,460
 In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was sojourning in remote

53
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:45,940
 parts of the hill country of Ephraim, who took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem

54
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,640
 in Judea.

55
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,460
 And his concubine was unfaithful to him.

56
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:57,100
 And she went away from him to her father's house at Bethlehem in Judea, and was there

57
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,100
 for some four months.

58
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,020
 And so Judges 19 starts off, there was no king in Israel.

59
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,300
 Israel denied God as their king.

60
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:15,100
 They did not want a theocracy that God would rule their hearts.

61
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,740
 And so it goes into this story that this Levite took for himself a concubine.

62
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:27,220
 Now a concubine nowadays would be considered a mistress.

63
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:38,340
 But back then, a concubine was considered a legal partner, a second wife.

64
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:45,680
 And so sometimes, especially if the first wife could not have children, they might take

65
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,100
 on a mistress.

66
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,740
 And the examples are Abraham.

67
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,940
 Abraham, Sarah couldn't have children.

68
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:58,700
 So Sarah was like, "Take my maid, and maybe you can have descendants."

69
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,580
 David also had many wives.

70
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,540
 And Solomon, well, obviously, he has as much wives as I do shoes.

71
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,540
 Not as much as Pastor James has shoes.

72
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:22,340
 But the concept of a concubine back then was not so foreign back then.

73
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,020
 It was considered a legal partner.

74
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:31,340
 However, this concubine was unfaithful to the Levite.

75
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:37,500
 And she maybe was not happy with her status as a second wife.

76
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,580
 Maybe she wasn't as privileged as much as the first wife.

77
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,420
 And so what happened was she was unfaithful.

78
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,180
 We don't know why she was unfaithful.

79
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,640
 The Bible just says that she was unfaithful.

80
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,700
 And she left from Ephraim, as we see the map in the next slide, from the hill country of

81
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,720
 Ephraim towards Bethlehem, which is her hometown.

82
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,500
 And so this Levite pursues her.

83
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,580
 He decides, "Oh, I really want to pursue after my concubine."

84
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,820
 And he goes with his servant to Bethlehem and travels all the way there.

85
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,500
 And the father-in-law welcomes him.

86
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,260
 And they have a great time.

87
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,620
 And he even stays several nights.

88
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:30,580
 And on the fourth night, fourth day, on the fourth day, the father-in-law is like, "You

89
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
 know what?

90
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,900
 Why don't you stay a couple more days?

91
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
 Stay another day.

92
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
 Drink.

93
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,900
 Be merry.

94
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
 Let's have a good time."

95
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,300
 It's sort of like, you know, maybe you go to an in-law's house or your grandma's house,

96
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,380
 and they're like, "Hey, continue.

97
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,380
 Stay over.

98
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,380
 I have lots of goodies.

99
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,420
 You know, stay a couple more hours.

100
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,420
 Let's have a good time."

101
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,180
 And so the father-in-law convinces the Levite to continue to stay.

102
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,300
 And they stay another night.

103
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,860
 And then, so they have a great time.

104
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:08,700
 And on the fifth day, the Levite and his servant and the concubine, they're about to leave.

105
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,180
 And the father-in-law is like, "No, no, come on.

106
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,420
 Let's have lunch.

107
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,980
 Let's have, let's have tea."

108
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,620
 And so they continue to have a meal.

109
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,540
 And they're merry, and they're drinking, and they're having a feast.

110
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,080
 And then the Levite's like, "Okay, it's really, we really have to leave now."

111
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,140
 And so they decide to leave.

112
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:37,860
 And so the Levite and the concubine and the servant decide to leave around the afternoon.

113
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:45,180
 And so what happens is they're traveling from Bethlehem, and it's getting late, right?

114
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,540
 Maybe you're hiking, and it's getting late, right?

115
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,580
 And you're like, "Oh, no, it's getting late.

116
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,940
 We really need to get back home," right?

117
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,540
 And so they decide, "Okay, we got to stay somewhere."

118
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,420
 And the servant's like, "Let's stay in this city or that city."

119
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,700
 And the Levite's like, "No, let's not stay in foreign countries.

120
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,540
 Let's stay in an Israelite, Israel part of territory."

121
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:18,500
 And so they decide to stay at Gibeah, right, as we see in the next map.

122
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,580
 So they travel from Bethlehem to Gibeah.

123
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,780
 And we see when they arrive at the city, as we see in the next couple of verses, they

124
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,220
 arrive at the city, and nobody wants to take them home, right?

125
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,300
 Back then, there was no houses or hotels, I mean.

126
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,900
 There was no hotels.

127
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,080
 There was no hotel.com.

128
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,580
 There was no booking.com.

129
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,660
 You couldn't book your place ahead of time.

130
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:49,220
 No, they relied on the hospitality of the people of Israel.

131
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,540
 And nobody would take them in.

132
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,340
 And so you're like, "Oh, this is a little bit weird, right?

133
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,780
 How come I'm in the city?

134
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,540
 I'm an Israelite.

135
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,780
 Nobody's willing to take me to their home, welcome me to their..."

136
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,820
 Yes, there is no hotels.com.

137
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,460
 However, there was a man that welcomed them, right?

138
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,500
 And actually, he was from the same city the Levite was from, right?

139
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,820
 From the hill country of Ephraim.

140
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,380
 And so this old man warns them, right?

141
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,300
 He says in the next couple of verses, in the next slide, "Peace be to you.

142
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,260
 I will care for you for all your wants.

143
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,980
 Only do not spend the night at the square."

144
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,980
 Right?

145
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,980
 All right.

146
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,980
 So nobody's welcoming them in.

147
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,860
 The only person that's welcoming them in is a person not from that town.

148
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,180
 And the old man warns them not to stay in the night.

149
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,940
 And so he brought them into their house, the old man did, and fed their donkeys, washed

150
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,500
 their feet, and they're having a feast.

151
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,420
 And they're having a great time.

152
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,340
 Their hearts were married.

153
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,980
 And then all of a sudden, they hear a knocking.

154
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,180
 And it's not Deliveroo.

155
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,860
 It's not Deliveroo.

156
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:15,060
 The Bible says this, that they were men of the city, worthless fellows.

157
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,460
 Okay?

158
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,460
 It was not Deliveroo.

159
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,700
 It was not a good thing.

160
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,700
 And what did they do?

161
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,100
 They were beating on the door, banging on the door, surrounding the house.

162
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,900
 And they said to the old man, "Bring the man who came into your house, that we may

163
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,900
 know him."

164
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:39,220
 Now, this is derogatory for having sex with this man, right?

165
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,420
 And this is not pretty, right?

166
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:49,860
 And the master of the house said to them, we see in the next couple verses, "My brothers,

167
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,500
 do not act so wickedly."

168
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
 Right?

169
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,580
 "Stop right there.

170
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,060
 Do not act so wickedly."

171
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,260
 Right?

172
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,140
 Instead, "This is my daughter, virgin daughter, and this is his concubine.

173
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,820
 Let me bring them to you."

174
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,540
 Violate them instead of violating this man.

175
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,780
 And this is not pretty.

176
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,220
 This is pretty wicked, right?

177
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,700
 In fact, this story reminds you of a certain story in Genesis, right?

178
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,260
 Lot, right?

179
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:28,140
 Welcoming the two angels or the two men into his house and the same sort of reaction in

180
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,180
 Sodom and Gomorrah.

181
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:38,860
 Now back then, in the Middle East, what happened was, if you invited somebody into your home,

182
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,420
 you were responsible for them.

183
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,060
 You were responsible for their meals, for their safety.

184
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:51,580
 And so what happened is, this old man wanted to protect the Levite.

185
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,820
 He wanted to protect the Levite.

186
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,140
 And instead, what did he do?

187
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,220
 He was willing to give up his virgin daughter and the concubine.

188
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,700
 Not pretty.

189
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,700
 Not pretty at all.

190
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:13,620
 And so we see in the next slide, what happens is, these men take advantage of the concubine

191
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,420
 and it was not pretty.

192
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:30,420
 And afterwards, the concubine fell down at the old man's house when it was morning.

193
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:37,380
 And so the Levite goes to her and says, "Get up.

194
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,140
 Let us be going."

195
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,060
 And this woman did not answer.

196
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:51,300
 And so then the Levite put her on the donkey and the man rose up and went away to his home.

197
00:12:51,300 --> 00:13:04,820
 And this chapter ends with another very ugly scene here.

198
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:11,260
 The man entered his house, took a knife, and taking hold of the concubine, divided her

199
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:19,900
 into pieces, 12 pieces, limb by limb, and sent them out to the territories of Israel.

200
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:26,380
 And all who saw it said, "Such a thing has never happened or seen from that day that

201
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,020
 the people of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day.

202
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,020
 Consider it.

203
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,060
 Take counsel and speak."

204
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:41,620
 And so we see in Judges 19, moral decay.

205
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:51,140
 Israel has fallen so far away from the Lord that they have gone to these wicked acts.

206
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:56,340
 And so we're going to do a little bit of a character study of what has happened here.

207
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,780
 Firstly, we're going to look into the life of the concubine.

208
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,100
 The good, the bad, and the ugly.

209
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,620
 And firstly, we see the bad from the concubine.

210
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,020
 The concubine was unfaithful to the Levite.

211
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:19,940
 She was supposedly his maid or second wife, considered back then.

212
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:27,720
 So she was unfaithful and she ran away to her father's house in Bethlehem.

213
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,020
 The good, maybe she tried to restore that relationship.

214
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:39,580
 When the Levite came to her father's house, she was willing to go away with the Levite

215
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,140
 after the fifth day.

216
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,820
 Maybe she was good in terms of trying to restore that relationship as well.

217
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
 We don't really know.

218
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,740
 The Bible doesn't really say.

219
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:53,300
 And so here we see the bad and the good, maybe the good from the concubine.

220
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,180
 Next we move on to the old man, the character study of the old man.

221
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,620
 Now firstly, we see the good.

222
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:07,660
 The good is that he was willing to give hospitality to the Levite.

223
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:15,380
 In the laws, God commands the Israelites that they should be hospitable to the people that

224
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,180
 come into their lands, the foreigners that come into their lands.

225
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,820
 And he was also good because he gave warning to the Levite.

226
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,980
 Don't go into the square.

227
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,940
 Don't stay the night there.

228
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:38,780
 Now the bad thing about the old man was that he was willing to give up his virgin daughter

229
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:52,820
 and the Levite's concubine when the worthless men of that city came knocking on his door.

230
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,300
 He was not a faithful father.

231
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,000
 Fathers are supposed to protect their daughters.

232
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,820
 If you were a father and these worthless men were coming and knocking on your house, would

233
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,420
 you not protect your daughter?

234
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:21,420
 It would be more heroic for him to give up himself instead of giving up his daughter.

235
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:31,920
 But the old man was so caught up in protecting his guest or the name of his house that he

236
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,320
 was willing to sacrifice his virgin daughter and the Levite's concubine.

237
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,840
 So we see the good from the old man, but we also see the bad.

238
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,760
 Next, we go to the Levite.

239
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,400
 Now the good of the Levite was he pursued the unfaithful concubine.

240
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:02,800
 And that's what we should do when there is some sort of problem in our marriage or relationship.

241
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,660
 We should seek restoration.

242
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:14,080
 Now the Bible, the Old Testament, does not give the okay to have multiple wives.

243
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:25,640
 Jesus himself says that a man should leave his house and be united with his wife.

244
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:35,520
 And so the Bible very clearly says that marriage should be between a man and a wife, one wife.

245
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,840
 And so it's not good that he had multiple wives.

246
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,480
 It was sort of accepted back then, but it wasn't really what the Lord wanted.

247
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,720
 None of these families were blessed when they had multiple wives in the family.

248
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,920
 It's good that he pursued, he was willing to reconcile and restore that relationship

249
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,400
 with the concubine.

250
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,440
 He was willing to go to his father's house, her father's house, and restore that relationship.

251
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:15,720
 Now the bad part was, after, when they arrived to the old man's house, he was willing to

252
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,320
 sacrifice his concubine for the men of Gibeah.

253
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,680
 He was willing to sacrifice sort of his second wife.

254
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,520
 He went all the way there to restore that relationship, and then all of a sudden when

255
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,120
 these wicked men, when these worthless men come and knocking on the door, he doesn't

256
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,520
 protect her.

257
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,960
 He's not willing to protect her.

258
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:46,400
 And in fact, he sort of, after being abused for the night, she's lying in front of the

259
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,320
 old man's house, he just goes up to her and says, "Come on, get up, let us be going."

260
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,160
 He does not say, "Are you okay taking care of her?" or whatnot.

261
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,160
 He's sort of inconsiderate.

262
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,680
 And the ugly part is that he divided her into 12 pieces.

263
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:12,600
 And we see that as people go away from the Lord, and further and further away from the

264
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,800
 Lord, their minds become twisted.

265
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:24,400
 Back then it wasn't uncommon, if Israel was going to war, they would make a sacrifice,

266
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:31,080
 and they would divide a sacrifice of a lamb or a goat into pieces and send it to the tribe.

267
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,280
 The tribes and territories of Israel, it was not uncommon, if they were going to war, that

268
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
 they would do that.

269
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:45,120
 But for this Levite to divide up the concubine into 12 pieces, it shows the state of moral

270
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,480
 decay that he was in.

271
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,680
 Israel was in moral decay.

272
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:59,960
 And lastly, we see the worthless fellows of Gibeah.

273
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:07,120
 They were so wicked that they were compared, it's basically like they were from Sodom and

274
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
 Gomorrah.

275
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,160
 The story is basically the same.

276
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:19,240
 They're knocking on the doors, asking, demanding that this man come out and that they would

277
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,040
 know him.

278
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,680
 Wicked.

279
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:30,760
 These worthless fellows were very wicked, and it shows the moral state of decay that

280
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,800
 Israel has gone into.

281
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:42,720
 When we go into sin, the sin becomes deeper and deeper, and it becomes harder and harder

282
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,640
 to get out.

283
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,400
 The moral decay, the stink of the moral decay becomes more and more like that apple.

284
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,680
 The rottenness of Israel is just like that rotten apple.

285
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
 Smelly.

286
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,240
 You can smell it.

287
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,880
 You can see the worms in it, the decay in it.

288
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,440
 You want nothing to do with it.

289
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,080
 And that was Israel.

290
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:13,080
 That was the men of Gibeah, the worthless fellows of Gibeah.

291
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,240
 This reflected the state of Israel.

292
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,240
 And what happens when there is moral decay?

293
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,840
 We see the result.

294
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,640
 The unfaithfulness.

295
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,480
 The unfaithfulness to others.

296
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:41,960
 The concubine was not faithful as a second wife.

297
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:48,680
 The Levite was not faithful in protecting the concubine, the second wife.

298
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:54,480
 The old man was not faithful, a faithful father to the virgin daughter.

299
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,400
 This virgin daughter is precious.

300
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,200
 It should be protected.

301
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,960
 But this father, this old man did not protect his virgin daughter.

302
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,440
 He was an unfaithful father.

303
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:17,440
 And these worthless fellows were unfaithful to God because they were doing despicable

304
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:24,640
 things that were against the laws of the Lord.

305
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,840
 And ultimately, all the people in this story, they were unfaithful in following the laws

306
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
 of the Lord.

307
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:39,800
 They were unfaithful, unfaithful people.

308
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,200
 And what I like about the Bible, it doesn't try to rewrite history.

309
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,080
 It doesn't make it pretty so that Israelite people are beautiful and they're perfect.

310
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,240
 No, it shows people as they are.

311
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,160
 It shows the good.

312
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,200
 It shows the bad.

313
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,560
 And it shows the ugly.

314
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,880
 And when we are in moral decay, we are ugly.

315
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:16,120
 And in the same way, if somebody did a character study on you and on me, there would also be

316
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:23,520
 some good things, some bad things, and some ugly things.

317
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:31,880
 When we go away from the Lord, when we walk in our own way, when we choose to look at

318
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,640
 things that we shouldn't be, it just snowballs.

319
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,080
 And it gets from bad to worse to ugly.

320
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,760
 And that is us.

321
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,600
 We may be doing good things, but there are also times that we fall short.

322
00:23:52,600 --> 00:24:02,480
 And so the challenge for us today, the challenge for us KFCI today, is how do we stay faithful?

323
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,240
 And there are several ways that we need to stay faithful.

324
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,720
 And as we look into the next slide, before we look into the next slide, here is a quote

325
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,080
 from Oswald Chambers.

326
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,400
 "God has not called us to be successful.

327
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,360
 God has called us to be faithful."

328
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,480
 God doesn't care about how many degrees you have.

329
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,920
 God doesn't care about how many number zeroes are in your bank.

330
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,840
 God cares if you are faithful as a student.

331
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,900
 God cares if you are faithful to the money that he's given you.

332
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:46,280
 God is caring more about if you are faithful in the job that he has given you.

333
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:54,000
 God has not called us to success, but to faithfulness.

334
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,080
 And here are five or six things that we can be faithful in.

335
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,600
 And the first thing is, are we faithful in our work?

336
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,240
 Are we a faithful worker?

337
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:13,680
 If the bank has hired us, if the church has hired us, if whatever job has hired us, are

338
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,520
 we faithful in our work?

339
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,080
 What are we doing when the boss is not looking?

340
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,760
 Are we faithful in our work?

341
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:30,160
 Do we give 100% to the work that he has given us?

342
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,080
 Ultimately, God is the one that gives us the work.

343
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,080
 Are we faithful in our word?

344
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,760
 Are we true to our own word?

345
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,680
 Are we true to our promises?

346
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,520
 You know, when I was in Uganda, I have a friend who's joining us from Uganda today, Mark,

347
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,160
 and he just got married.

348
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,240
 And when I was in Uganda six years ago or seven years ago, it was really hard to make

349
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,320
 appointments with people.

350
00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:00,120
 Because in Uganda, the concept of time is that time works for you.

351
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,120
 Time works for you.

352
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,760
 And so, you know, it's 12pm and he made an appointment for lunch and I'm like, "Are you

353
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
 coming?"

354
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,040
 And they're like, "I'm coming, I'm coming."

355
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:19,120
 And it's like 12.30, 1pm, and they may show up at 1pm.

356
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,800
 Are we true to our promises?

357
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,680
 Are we true to our word?

358
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:30,260
 And sometimes, you know, especially early in the morning, it's hard for me to be on

359
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,300
 time sometimes.

360
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,720
 Are we true to our word?

361
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,800
 Are we true in our relationships?

362
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,120
 Are we faithful?

363
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,280
 Are we faithful friends?

364
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,860
 Are we faithful fathers?

365
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,680
 Are we faithful spouses?

366
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,220
 Are we faithful fathers?

367
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,120
 Are we faithful as friends?

368
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,120
 Or do we just stab our brothers or our friends in the back?

369
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,400
 That concept of stabbing in the back, just talking badly about our friends and our fathers

370
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,020
 and our family or whoever.

371
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,320
 Are we faithful as friends?

372
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,240
 Are we faithful in our character?

373
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,400
 Can we be reliable?

374
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,200
 Are we trusted?

375
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,220
 Are we believed?

376
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,740
 Are we faithful in our character?

377
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,760
 And we learn in the Bible that faithfulness is a fruit of the Spirit.

378
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,160
 We've been learning about fruits, we were learning about fruits of the Spirit in SEP.

379
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:41,360
 And faithfulness is a fruit of the Holy Spirit, is a fruit of the Spirit.

380
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,960
 Faithfulness does not come naturally ourselves.

381
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,600
 We must rely on the Holy Spirit to help us to be faithful in our character.

382
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,920
 And are we faithful towards God?

383
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,000
 Faithful in following God and his promises and his law?

384
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,640
 Are we faithful as Christians, faithful followers of God?

385
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,120
 And lastly, I added this one, are we faithful in adversity?

386
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,440
 It's easy to be faithful as a friend, right?

387
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,160
 When things are going well and everything is merry.

388
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:26,840
 It's easy to be faithful to God when God is blessing you and everything is going well.

389
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,640
 Are we faithful when times are tough?

390
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:39,200
 When our marriage is going through rough patches, are we willing to be faithful?

391
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:48,200
 When times are tough between friends, are we willing to be faithful?

392
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,440
 When we're going through ups and downs spiritually, are we willing to continue to be faithful

393
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,960
 to God and trust that he is there for us?

394
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,400
 That he is on our side?

395
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,120
 Are we faithful in times like these?

396
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,100
 When there is a global pandemic?

397
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,240
 When there is social social distancing?

398
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,520
 When things are hard, are we still willing to be faithful?

399
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:22,840
 Are we still faithful to come on Zoom and worship together as a body of Christ to make

400
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,480
 that a priority?

401
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,960
 Are we faithful?

402
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,760
 And I'm going to finish off with four points of how we can be faithful today.

403
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:41,980
 The first thing that we can do is focus on knowing the faithfulness of God.

404
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,640
 As we know God more, as we study his word more, as we go into fellowship more, as we

405
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,840
 worship together more, as we're knowing God through the Bible, through worship, through

406
00:29:51,840 --> 00:30:00,280
 church, we will become, I truly believe that we will become more like God as we know God

407
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
 more.

408
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:07,100
 And we will desire, God will give us this desire to know him and to become more like

409
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,100
 him.

410
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,640
 And God is faithful even when we are not.

411
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,940
 And we can learn that God is always faithful.

412
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:21,100
 When Israel turned away to sin, to idols, God was always faithful.

413
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,640
 God is always faithful to you, even when you fall away.

414
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:33,440
 He is like that father for the prodigal son waiting, running towards you.

415
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,520
 God is a faithful father.

416
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,520
 And as we know God more, I believe that we will want to become more like him and become

417
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
 more like him.

418
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,240
 And the second thing is we need to repent of our unfaithfulness.

419
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:57,760
 In each one of our lives, there is good, there is bad, but we can repent of our faithfulness.

420
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,360
 He is compassionate and forgiving of us.

421
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,680
 If we truly come towards him, confess the things that we've done wrong, how we've been

422
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:15,600
 unfaithful to God, and turn 180 degrees from our own direction, from our own desires, towards

423
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,240
 the Lord.

424
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,160
 Next we need to rely on the Holy Spirit.

425
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,600
 The Holy Spirit is there to sanctify us, make us more like Jesus.

426
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,080
 We cannot do it on our own strength.

427
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,920
 We must rely on the Holy Spirit to help us.

428
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:41,720
 And lastly, God put us in a community, in a church, in a body of Christ, so that we

429
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,520
 could be stronger together.

430
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:53,560
 Accountability helps us so that we can keep each other accountable.

431
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,720
 So I hope this message, it was a hard message.

432
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:06,480
 It's a difficult passage, but it's also a lesson for us today that as unfaithful as

433
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,200
 Israel is, God is faithful.

434
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:18,840
 And he's calling you and me to be faithful, to be a faithful father, a faithful friend,

435
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,240
 a faithful Christian.

436
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:28,120
 And I pray that you would rely on the Spirit and become faithful to him in the midst of

437
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,160
 these hard times.

438
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,880
 Let us pray and respond in a song.

439
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,240
 God give us clean hands and a clean heart.

440
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,640
 Let us not turn our hearts to another.

441
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,980
 Father, we thank you that you are always faithful.

442
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,900
 Even when we are unfaithful, even when we fall astray, you are always faithful.

443
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:59,200
 You are that father that is waiting for us, running after us.

444
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,160
 You love us and you call us to be like you, to be perfect like you.

445
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:11,880
 And Father, we are not perfect, but we desire to be and we want to be.

446
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,300
 Fill us with the Spirit, help us to surrender to the Holy Spirit so that we can be faithful

447
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,940
 and have the fruit of faithfulness.

448
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,940
 Bless us, Lord.

449
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,940
 In Christ's name we pray.

450
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,660
 Amen.

451
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,240
 (gentle music)
