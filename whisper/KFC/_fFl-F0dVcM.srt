1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 It's such a distinct joy to be with you this morning.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,640
 I want to begin with a simple question.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,560
 What's your prized possession?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,440
 What do you consider a cherished possession in your life?

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,600
 For me, one of my prized possessions

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
 comes through a birthday greeting

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,440
 of my daughter, Belisha.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,600
 And she's sitting in front telling me, don't call me

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,960
 to stand, don't call me to stand.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,800
 I want to read to you the birthday greeting,

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,920
 and I'll tell you why.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,800
 She said, happy birthday to the number one dad in the world.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,920
 Thank you for being there when I needed you, even when I didn't.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,360
 Thank you for teaching me manners.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,200
 Thank you for teaching me to be humble

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,600
 and to give honor when honor is due by modeling it yourself.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,320
 Thank you for not giving up on me,

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,720
 even during my rebellious years.

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,960
 When I came home late, lied to you, made you wait,

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,280
 and was always late.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,920
 Thank you for giving me so many second chances.

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,120
 Thank you for training me in public speaking.

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,960
 Thank you for helping me to constantly achieve an A grade

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,400
 in English and literature.

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
 Thank you for giving me such a beautiful name, Belisha,

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,400
 which means dedicated to God.

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,080
 Thank you for reminding me I'm loved, even when you are angry,

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,360
 you pick me up when I fall.

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,080
 Thank you for the chocolate milks, chocolate milkshake,

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,000
 and chocolate cakes.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,480
 Thank you for countless opportunities.

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,760
 Thank you for my education.

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,800
 Thank you for bringing me to your workplace,

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,080
 to your meetings, and even on overseas trips with you.

35
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,080
 Thank you for making me the most well-traveled

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,840
 among my friends and even teachers by the age of seven.

37
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,560
 Thank you for always offering to drive me to school and work

38
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,120
 in time, for picking me up even in the middle of the night.

39
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,840
 Thank you for always prioritizing Amanda and me

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,160
 over work, despite your busy schedule.

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,040
 Thank you for reminding me adopted means loved.

42
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,760
 Thank you so much.

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,840
 Sorry, there's so much to thank you for, so much honored you,

44
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,400
 so many memories to cherish.

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,960
 Even a lifetime of gratitude wouldn't be enough.

46
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,120
 Most of all, I want to thank you for adopting me,

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,040
 because if you hadn't, none of this would have been possible,

48
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,480
 not even my life.

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,800
 So thank you, Daddy.

50
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,560
 I love you.

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:38,600
 Now, when Belisha said not even my life,

52
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,160
 I shared in a testimony in the Hong Kong Bible Conference,

53
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,320
 she was a very sickly child.

54
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,880
 We adopted her, brought her home, prayed for her.

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,440
 And I'm very thankful the Lord healed her.

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,800
 But I tell you why I read to you this birthday message,

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,840
 because this is what I'm most grateful for.

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,080
 When I read this, the primary thought that came to my heart

59
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,920
 is, "Oh, I'm so grateful I'm a great father."

60
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,320
 That wasn't in my heart, because I am a work in progress.

61
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,440
 I'm also thankful for a wonderful daughter,

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,520
 but that wasn't the first thing in my heart.

63
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,920
 I tell you what is the first thing in my heart.

64
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,680
 I am very grateful that my daughter is grateful.

65
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,440
 I'm grateful for her gratitude.

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,760
 Because if she's grateful, then she

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,480
 wouldn't walk with a sense of a spirit of entitlement

68
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,280
 or presumptuousness.

69
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,960
 This is what God looks to us as His children,

70
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,440
 a spirit of gratitude, a spirit of thanksgiving.

71
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,680
 That's why thanksgiving is so important in our worship.

72
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,640
 Thanksgiving is so important in our discipleship.

73
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,760
 And thanksgiving is so important in our leadership,

74
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,000
 so that we don't have a spirit of entitlement.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Out of us is a deep sense of gratitude.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Now, it's easy to talk about gratitude

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,360
 when things are going well.

78
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,400
 It is very hard to talk about gratitude

79
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,760
 when we are in the wilderness.

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,200
 So what I want to do this morning

81
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,880
 is to give us a perspective of the wilderness,

82
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,640
 so that we are able to understand with clarity

83
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,240
 what it means to walk with God, even in the wilderness,

84
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,120
 and have a sense of worship and gratitude

85
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,800
 that flows out of our life.

86
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:28,280
 A key passage in the Scripture for us is in Isaiah 40.

87
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,040
 And Isaiah 40 is a prophetic voice in the wilderness.

88
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,920
 Before we explore it this morning,

89
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,880
 would you bow with me in a word of prayer

90
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,320
 and ask for the Lord's blessing?

91
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,720
 Eternal God and Heavenly Father, once again,

92
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,280
 open our eyes to behold your truth,

93
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,960
 so that we might behold you.

94
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,880
 Help us to engage you and your truth

95
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,000
 with a sense of gratitude and joy

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,800
 for the power, the grace, and the glory

97
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,280
 of your wonderful favour and love towards us.

98
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,920
 Help us, therefore, Lord, to understand

99
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,440
 that the wilderness is not a place that is terrifying.

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,080
 It's actually a place that is therapeutic.

101
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,520
 It heals us.

102
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,200
 It directs us.

103
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,080
 It teaches us.

104
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,360
 For all this, we give you thanks in Jesus' name.

105
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,760
 Amen.

106
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,520
 You see, in life, we've got to understand

107
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,920
 things are not what they seem.

108
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,320
 And one of the key things that's not what it seems

109
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,040
 is in the wilderness.

110
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,960
 In one of my visits in Israel,

111
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,360
 there was a tour bus that took us around,

112
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,080
 and it passes through a wilderness.

113
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,480
 And Hannah, our tour guide, said something brilliant.

114
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,040
 She said, "Ah, the wilderness.

115
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,960
 What a special place,

116
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,600
 because in the emptiness of the wilderness,

117
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,480
 God speaks.

118
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,960
 In the wilderness of our life, God speaks."

119
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,080
 And so I want to connect us with reality,

120
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,960
 a reality of God breaking into our lives

121
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,680
 in every aspect, including the wilderness.

122
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,040
 Now, I use the word wilderness as a metaphor of life,

123
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,720
 of the times of barrenness, the times of disconnectedness.

124
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,120
 It can come through a miscarriage.

125
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,280
 It can come through a retrenchment of our jobs.

126
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,920
 It can come with a relational tension,

127
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,000
 or a marital problem, or parenting, or ministry.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,640
 Anything that gives us a sense of this connectedness

129
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,800
 is the wilderness we are walking through.

130
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,480
 Turn with me in Isaiah 40,

131
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,680
 and we'll begin with verse 3 to verse 5.

132
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,880
 Isaiah 40, verse 3 to verse 5 says,

133
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,200
 "In the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord.

134
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,680
 Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

135
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,400
 Every valley will be lifted up,

136
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,680
 and every mountain and hill be made low.

137
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,280
 The uneven ground shall become level,

138
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,440
 and the rough places a plain.

139
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,760
 And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,

140
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,440
 and all flesh shall see it together,

141
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,560
 for the mouth of the Lord has spoken."

142
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,960
 You see, in Biblical history,

143
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,000
 the wilderness was a journey from the bondage of Egypt

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,160
 into the Promised Land.

145
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,120
 It was through the wilderness.

146
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
 40 years in the wilderness.

147
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,520
 How do we get that 40 years in the wilderness?

148
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,120
 How did it come about?

149
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,000
 Because when they came out of Egypt into the Promised Land,

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,480
 Moses sent 12 spies to spy the Promised Land

151
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,640
 and bring back a report.

152
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,440
 So 40 days, they went to spy the land,

153
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,720
 and after 40 days, they came back.

154
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,160
 Two spies gave a faith report, Joshua and Caleb,

155
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,440
 but the other 10 spies were report of doubt and unbelief.

156
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,560
 And these reports discouraged the people.

157
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,240
 They believed the 10 spies.

158
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
 They too were in doubt and unbelief,

159
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,920
 and God judged them.

160
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,000
 God says for every day, you spy the land

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,800
 and yet bring back the report,

162
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,760
 even though it's a good land, a Promised Land.

163
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,360
 For every day, you have one year in the wilderness.

164
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,480
 40 days, therefore 40 years.

165
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,240
 The question we ask then is, why the wilderness?

166
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,080
 Why not?

167
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,000
 You are so unbelieving, send them back to Egypt.

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,880
 Why the wilderness?

169
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,520
 There are two basic reasons.

170
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,040
 One is God's promise.

171
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,240
 Because of His promise to Abraham,

172
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,920
 that God has given the land,

173
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,360
 if every time the children of God are in disbelief,

174
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,840
 He sends them back to Egypt, sends them back to Egypt,

175
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,680
 they will never enter the Promised Land.

176
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,880
 The wilderness was given by God,

177
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,080
 actually as His grace,

178
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,680
 as His grace to tutor them and to build up their faith.

179
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,200
 So that's the second reason.

180
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,200
 It's the purpose of God to develop a people of faith.

181
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,480
 We must understand that the wilderness is not just a place,

182
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,160
 not merely a place of punishment,

183
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,400
 rather it's a place of development.

184
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,040
 It is not a destination.

185
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,000
 It is but a transit point.

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,080
 In other words, this is important to learn.

187
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,720
 Whatever wilderness you and I go through,

188
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,280
 God does not intend for us to live in the wilderness.

189
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,320
 He intends for us to learn from the wilderness.

190
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,560
 It's an important principle.

191
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,000
 We don't live in the wilderness

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,640
 because it's not our destination.

193
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,480
 It's a place by which we learn

194
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,880
 because it's our tuition centre.

195
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
 So when you're going through a very difficult time,

196
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,120
 whatever the condition is in your life,

197
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,040
 take it as God's tuition centre

198
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,120
 and you are paying the tuition fee

199
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,240
 in order to grow, in order to learn.

200
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,040
 Now, there are good news

201
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,200
 and also bad news in the wilderness.

202
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,160
 Let me give you the bad news first.

203
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,440
 The bad news in the wilderness,

204
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,200
 number one, we can lose our bearing in the wilderness.

205
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,240
 You see, the wilderness in Palestine

206
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,880
 is a place of emptiness, barrenness, there's nothing.

207
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,440
 And in the desert, it is possible for people to be so lost

208
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,640
 that they wander around in circles and lose their bearing.

209
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,760
 I'm a Singaporean in urban Singapore.

210
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,560
 It's a small city.

211
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,120
 It's not easy to get lost in Singapore.

212
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,640
 The signs are everywhere.

213
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,280
 You can have GPS, you can have so many other aids

214
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,280
 to help, ways to tell me where to go.

215
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,920
 But once, I was lost in the wilderness in Africa.

216
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,560
 No GPS because there's completely no signal.

217
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,080
 Anne and I were with another elderly missionary couple,

218
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,440
 four in a car.

219
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,360
 I was driving and we were looking for Johannesburg.

220
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,440
 We were down south.

221
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,440
 And what happened was that we couldn't find Johannesburg.

222
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,320
 I went to ask for direction.

223
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,480
 I was given a map.

224
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,320
 I studied the map.

225
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,040
 I think I know which road to take.

226
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,840
 And we miscalculated again.

227
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,680
 I'm Singaporean.

228
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,560
 We don't have four seasons.

229
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,240
 Singapore has only one season and one weather.

230
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,840
 Hot, still hot, very hot, and still very hot.

231
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,080
 We don't have four seasons.

232
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,120
 And so I didn't know in the winter,

233
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,520
 the sun sets very quickly.

234
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,480
 And so there in Africa, I thought I have,

235
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,960
 I was traveling at mid-afternoon.

236
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,480
 I thought we have enough sunlight to drive on.

237
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,600
 Suddenly I was caught with the sunset and darkness engulfed us.

238
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,760
 When I say darkness engulfed us, it's complete darkness.

239
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,120
 No street lamp, no street light, no street sign.

240
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,560
 In other words, you imagine I was driving in the car,

241
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,840
 four of us.

242
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,520
 I look in front in the headlamp.

243
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,280
 I see nothing because the two beams shines into nothing.

244
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,560
 It's the wilderness.

245
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,200
 Behind, I look behind, it is pitch darkness, nothing.

246
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,440
 So it's just one road.

247
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
 I don't know where it's leading to.

248
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,640
 I travel miles and miles of nothing.

249
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,280
 So I wasn't sure whether I'm headed the right direction.

250
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,040
 Don't know where to go, no street light.

251
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,720
 Finally, I decided to stop

252
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,360
 because I was hoping if I drive on for a while,

253
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,040
 maybe I can find some sign.

254
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,120
 There was nothing.

255
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,720
 So I stopped the car by the side of the road.

256
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,080
 I learned afterwards, I don't need to stop by the side of the road.

257
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,760
 There's no car.

258
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,920
 There was nothing in the wilderness.

259
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,400
 And I look up to look for the Northern Star

260
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,920
 because I'm traveling up north.

261
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,800
 If I can find the North Star, the Southern Cross, the constellation,

262
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,640
 I'll be able to get the northern direction

263
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,640
 and get a sense of where Johannesburg roughly is.

264
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,600
 I located the constellation of the Southern Cross,

265
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,520
 get my bearing where North is,

266
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,160
 headed towards that direction

267
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,320
 and eventually found Johannesburg.

268
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,840
 I learned a lesson that day,

269
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,400
 when you are lost, look up.

270
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,240
 Because God will always guide us when we look up.

271
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,560
 The bad news in the wilderness is when there are no signs,

272
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,840
 when we don't know what is happening,

273
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,360
 we lose our bearing and as a result, second bad news,

274
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,960
 we lose our confidence.

275
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,280
 In other words, we become so disoriented,

276
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,240
 we don't know how to proceed in the wilderness.

277
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,760
 There is a key that I want to pass to you that have helped me.

278
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,680
 And that is, when you don't know what to do,

279
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,120
 you do what you know, you will know what to do.

280
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,720
 Let me repeat that.

281
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,040
 When you don't know what to do, you go back to basics.

282
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,840
 You do what you know and then you'll know what to do.

283
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,520
 I was talking to a surgeon, actually a gynaecologist.

284
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,800
 He's one of the best trained overseas

285
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,880
 and he's a Malaysian doctor, Malaysian surgeon.

286
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,720
 He told me that there are times when he was doing surgery

287
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,520
 and suddenly he sees things the textbook has never spoken of.

288
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,240
 Never seen, never read before, never studied in medical school.

289
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,280
 And in those times when it is a great uncertainty before him

290
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,800
 and he's right there in the surgery, what do you do?

291
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,000
 He says he remembered the teaching of his professor.

292
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,840
 And that is, when you see something you've never seen before

293
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,520
 and you don't know what to do, always go back to the basics.

294
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,200
 Always go back to the fundamentals

295
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,680
 because your top priority is to save life.

296
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,440
 Go back to the fundamentals, it will save life.

297
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,600
 When you don't know what to do, stick to the fundamentals.

298
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,080
 Do what you know in the fundamentals

299
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,240
 and it will guide you in what you do.

300
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,000
 You don't have to lose a sense of confidence and panic.

301
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,040
 Get back to the fundamentals.

302
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,320
 Third bad news, when we lose our bearing and our confidence,

303
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,520
 we tend to wander in the wilderness.

304
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,200
 And that is why we meander around

305
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
 because we are not sure where to go.

306
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,240
 We are not sure how to proceed.

307
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,840
 And that's why it's often called the wilderness wandering.

308
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,560
 It is seen when travellers get lost in the desert.

309
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,000
 When they trace back their steps,

310
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,360
 you could see their steps walking.

311
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,400
 They're actually walking around in circle.

312
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,080
 They don't think they're walking around in circle.

313
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,560
 They think they're walking straight,

314
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,720
 but they become so disoriented.

315
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,760
 If you take a view from the top,

316
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,480
 you can see them walking around in a big circle.

317
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,920
 They are wandering in the wilderness

318
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,880
 because they get disoriented and lost.

319
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,720
 Now, here's the fourth bad news.

320
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,800
 Wilderness wandering wearies us.

321
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,400
 We get tired.

322
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,240
 We can't make sense of what's going on.

323
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,600
 We get confounded and we lose heart.

324
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,520
 We get discouraged.

325
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,240
 Very often in the wilderness of our life,

326
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,440
 we go like, "Lord, how long will all this last?

327
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,920
 Why am I going through this again and again and again?"

328
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,320
 Cultivate patience because they are, as I said,

329
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,680
 tuition fees to be paid in the wilderness.

330
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,400
 The fifth bad news is that the wilderness is a battleground,

331
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,280
 but it's a different kind of battleground.

332
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,480
 It's not a battleground with armies and chariots outside.

333
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,800
 It's a battleground within, without discouragement,

334
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,880
 fears, anxieties. It's an inner battle.

335
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,320
 Ah, but there's good news in the wilderness.

336
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,600
 Let me tell you some of this good news.

337
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,320
 One, we can experience God's presence in the wilderness.

338
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:18,200
 The Bible speaks of times of refreshing in the presence of God.

339
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
 So if whatever wilderness we are facing,

340
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,840
 whatever discouraging circumstances,

341
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,680
 enter the sanctuary into the presence of God.

342
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:33,360
 Because in the sanctuary, we find times of refreshing.

343
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,040
 The second good news, we can receive God's provision in the wilderness.

344
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,000
 God is present and God will provide.

345
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,600
 That's what the children of Israel learn.

346
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,600
 That even in the wilderness journey, because of their unbelief,

347
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,000
 God has to give them the extra tuition God provided for them.

348
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,640
 Nehemiah 9 is a historical recital of the faithfulness of God

349
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,840
 from the Exodus into the years of the wilderness,

350
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,720
 recorded in the book of Numbers.

351
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,880
 And there in the historical recital of God's faithfulness,

352
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,640
 there are many times in that chapter, Nehemiah 9,

353
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,000
 where it says God provided, God supplied, God gave, God gave, God gave.

354
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,080
 God provides in the wilderness.

355
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,480
 That is why we have to anchor into His presence and have the confidence

356
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,520
 God will never lead you where His grace cannot keep you.

357
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,080
 God will never lead you where His grace cannot keep you.

358
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,520
 Because His grace will always be sufficient for us.

359
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,160
 His strength always make perfect in our weaknesses.

360
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,800
 Morning by morning, this has been a refrain in my prayer.

361
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,000
 And that is the faithfulness of God and His grace.

362
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,160
 His grace is sufficient for me.

363
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,840
 His grace is sufficient for you.

364
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,840
 His strength is make perfect in our weaknesses.

365
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,080
 So therefore, we can experience God's power in the wilderness.

366
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,600
 Not just His presence or His provision, but His power.

367
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,840
 And God shows His power to those who will trust Him and rely on Him.

368
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,240
 His strength makes strong in our weaknesses.

369
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,280
 So the key thing I learned in my faith journey is lean in on God,

370
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,680
 depend upon God, rest upon God.

371
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:39,080
 Our posture makes a difference.

372
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,880
 In one of the art galleries in London,

373
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,400
 there is an entire floor that is dedicated to Italian Renaissance art.

374
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,560
 And one day there's an art professor by the name of Dr Robert Cumming,

375
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,920
 professor of the History of Art in Boston University.

376
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,240
 He came to admire the art pieces of these Italian masters.

377
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,160
 And he came before a painting by Lippi, the 15th century artist.

378
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,320
 And the painting is called Virgin and Child.

379
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,840
 He stood there to admire the painting.

380
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,240
 But he said to himself,

381
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,880
 "There's something not quite right about this painting."

382
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,600
 But he couldn't put his finger upon what exactly is not quite right about painting.

383
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,960
 He admired the brush strokes, he admired the colour,

384
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,240
 he admired the presentation of the art piece,

385
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,800
 but he can't tell there's just something, some proportion not quite right.

386
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,160
 He can't figure out what it was.

387
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,160
 And then finally the thought struck him.

388
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:45,040
 What if this art piece wasn't meant to be commissioned for an art gallery?

389
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:52,520
 What if this piece was meant for a prayer room, a prayer chamber?

390
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,760
 If it's a prayer chamber,

391
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,640
 they don't stand to admire the art piece like an art gallery.

392
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,840
 They kneel.

393
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,040
 So Professor Cummings did something he has never done in a gallery.

394
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,600
 He knelt in front of the painting.

395
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,120
 And when he knelt in front of the painting,

396
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,800
 he looked up.

397
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,400
 Oh, everything was in the right proportion.

398
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,720
 Mary was holding the child close and everything was,

399
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,840
 the hills in the background was beautiful.

400
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,480
 Everything was in the right proportion.

401
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,680
 You see, here's the principle.

402
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,680
 Our posture determines our perspective.

403
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,440
 And when we come to a place where we rely on God,

404
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,080
 we lean in on God,

405
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,920
 we will find His grace in the wilderness.

406
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,880
 So it says for us in verse 3,

407
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,840
 "A voice cries in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord.'"

408
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,520
 How do you prepare the way for the Lord?

409
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,400
 You prepare the way for the Lord by the posture you take in prayer,

410
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,040
 in dependence, in quiet submission to God.

411
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,600
 Because when we do that, here's the fourth good news.

412
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,200
 We can discover God's purpose in the wilderness.

413
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,400
 That God allows seasons of wilderness in our life

414
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,760
 to teach us things that we otherwise cannot learn

415
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,880
 apart from that wilderness.

416
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,920
 Ah, but here comes the attack of the lie of the evil one.

417
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,160
 The lie of Satan is he tells us,

418
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,120
 "There is no way out of the wilderness.

419
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,440
 You are trapped in the wilderness.

420
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,800
 It is hopeless."

421
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,280
 And we panic.

422
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,320
 We think, "Oh, our marriage is hopeless.

423
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,200
 Or our parenting is hopeless.

424
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,560
 Or our ministry is hopeless.

425
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,240
 Or the church is hopeless.

426
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,760
 Or our job is hopeless.

427
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,200
 Our boss is hopeless.

428
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,960
 Everything around is hopeless."

429
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,920
 And then we come, "I am hopeless."

430
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,840
 Because everything is hopeless.

431
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,040
 Don't lose hope.

432
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,520
 Never call hopeless what God has not called hopeless.

433
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,840
 A definition of bondage is when we call hopeless

434
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,920
 what God has not called hopeless.

435
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,040
 And therefore, in that hopelessness,

436
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,440
 we are in bondage.

437
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,280
 God is the bondage breaker.

438
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,200
 With God, there is always hope.

439
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,920
 Prepare the way in the wilderness

440
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,520
 is when we come to a place of surrender

441
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,560
 and we lean in on the God of hope.

442
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:27,040
 Otherwise, there is no way out of our wilderness.

443
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,000
 It crushes us into despair and discouragement.

444
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,840
 And Satan wins because he intimidates us.

445
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,440
 "There is no way you're going to get out of your wilderness.

446
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,360
 It is hopeless."

447
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,800
 But God tells us,

448
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,760
 "You will find grace in the wilderness."

449
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,480
 He repeated that prophetic word in Jeremiah 31 verse 2.

450
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,640
 That in the wilderness, you will find grace in it.

451
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,400
 Because God doesn't merely lead us to the wilderness.

452
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,560
 He leads us through the wilderness.

453
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,480
 He invites us to a missional intimacy with Him.

454
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,520
 So what's our response?

455
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,880
 Let me offer to you some basic fundamentals

456
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,360
 that we must hold on to as we respond to the Lord.

457
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,280
 Number one is to realise everyone

458
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,680
 encounters a wilderness season in our life.

459
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
 When I was younger, I thought, "Oh, if you're a godly Christian,

460
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,120
 you will not have a wilderness experience."

461
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,680
 Until I read the Scripture, it says,

462
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:33,680
 "The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tested."

463
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,000
 I learned that God uses the wilderness for our good.

464
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,840
 The second lesson is that the greatest snare in the wilderness

465
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,800
 is murmuring and complaining.

466
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,240
 And the reason for murmuring and complaining is unbelief.

467
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,240
 What we need to do is to learn to keep a gratitude journal.

468
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,320
 That is why I begin by saying to us,

469
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,840
 gratitude is so important because God is the one

470
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,680
 who makes straight in the desert a highway for Himself

471
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,800
 when we walk with faith and gratitude.

472
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,400
 He says, "Every valley shall be lifted up

473
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,400
 and every mountain and hill shall be made low."

474
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,880
 In other words, God Himself, He will make the path for you.

475
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,480
 So keep a gratitude journal.

476
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,480
 Record God's goodness in your life.

477
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,880
 The third response is to realise we have a choice in the wilderness.

478
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,400
 It is not a time to be crippled by our doubts or anxieties.

479
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,680
 It's a time to anchor in the Word of God and to move on in faith.

480
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,440
 It is to declare the goodness of God.

481
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,760
 Look at verse 6 now.

482
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,320
 It says, "A voice cried and said,

483
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,600
 'What shall I cry?'

484
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,840
 That is a prophetic declaration of God's Word.

485
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,440
 That is a prophetic voice in the Scripture we must heed.

486
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,840
 That's the fourth response we must learn, that God speaks.

487
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,400
 Through the prophets, He gives us hope.

488
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,240
 So now the prophet Isaiah asked, "What shall I cry?"

489
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,360
 And the statement is, "All flesh is grass

490
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,200
 and all the beauty is like the flower of the field.

491
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,000
 The grass withers, the flower fades.

492
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,240
 When the breath of the Lord blows upon it,

493
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,160
 surely the people are grass.

494
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,960
 The grass withers, the flower fades.

495
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,920
 But the Word of the Lord stands forever."

496
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:34,600
 Now, this is only the preface of what he's supposed to cry out.

497
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,160
 It is not what Isaiah was to cry out.

498
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,240
 It's the reason given.

499
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,480
 In other words, when the Spirit said, "Cry,"

500
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,720
 and Isaiah the prophet said, "What shall I cry?"

501
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,960
 The premise, the reason given is,

502
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,320
 everything else will fade away except the Word of God.

503
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,040
 Meaning, there is nothing worthy to cry out

504
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,320
 except the Word of God.

505
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,680
 So what is the Word of God that Isaiah was supposed to cry out?

506
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,000
 We find that now in the next verse, verse 9.

507
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,160
 "Go up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good news.

508
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,000
 Lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem,

509
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,120
 herald of good news.

510
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,600
 Lift it up, fear not.

511
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,360
 Say to the cities of Judah, 'Behold your God.'"

512
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,000
 These are the three words the prophet was to cry out,

513
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,560
 even in the wilderness.

514
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,960
 "Behold your God."

515
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,800
 Whatever difficulty or crisis you are in,

516
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,400
 "Behold your God."

517
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,960
 Whatever challenges you face, "Behold your God."

518
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,480
 Whatever problems come your way, "Behold your God."

519
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,000
 Whatever darkness there is in your life, "Behold your God."

520
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,400
 That's the prophetic word.

521
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,120
 That's the key.

522
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,840
 "Behold your God."

523
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,720
 When we understand this key,

524
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,120
 gratitude flows out of our heart.

525
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,480
 Because we have a loving Father.

526
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,800
 Because we have a Father who cares for us.

527
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,000
 Jesus said, "If you being evil know how to give good gifts to your children,

528
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,160
 how much more does the heavenly Father give good gifts

529
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,920
 to those who are called His children?"

530
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,600
 We are the children of God.

531
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,040
 He wants to bless us with His favour and His grace.

532
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,920
 But He calls us to understand we are not to behold the world.

533
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,920
 We are not to behold its glamour and splendour and deceptions and illusions

534
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,560
 and get all confused by what is the trappings of success,

535
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,040
 or the symbols of success, or the tokens of success.

536
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:54,760
 God wants us to be truly successful when we behold our God.

537
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:00,040
 Oh, we need a radical definition of success in our life.

538
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:06,040
 Success is not when everything is up in the mountain and celebrative and high.

539
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,760
 Success is even when we are in the valley.

540
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,640
 Even when wilderness sets in.

541
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,120
 Even when we cry tears nobody knows, nobody sees but God.

542
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:24,080
 Even in those valleys, God is there with us.

543
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,760
 And when we lay hold of Him,

544
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,960
 that's true success.

545
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,920
 Because when we lay hold of Him,

546
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:40,640
 there will be a profound sense of gratitude when we behold Him.

547
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,440
 I think at the end of the day,

548
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,120
 there is always hope when we lay hold of God.

549
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,080
 But we must be willing to come out of our comfort zone,

550
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,200
 to follow the Lord's leading, to lean in on God.

551
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,520
 My time has caught up with me. I want to close with a true story.

552
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,120
 Many years ago, I was in Malaysia preaching with a group of Singaporean pastors.

553
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,120
 They rented a big auditorium and several churches gathered there.

554
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,120
 We took turns to preach that night. My friend was preaching.

555
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,120
 I was sitting in front listening to him and the Lord spoke to me,

556
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,440
 "Son, go behind."

557
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,000
 I went behind and I thought, "Wow, this is a great vantage point."

558
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,120
 I could see my friend preaching.

559
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,000
 I see the churches gathered. I could pray for them.

560
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,640
 And that's what I did. While I was praying,

561
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,400
 the Holy Spirit fell upon me and gave me a simple word that shocked me.

562
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,320
 "Son, dance."

563
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,440
 Edmund Chan don't do dance.

564
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,200
 I am an evangelical, son of a non-dancing evangelical.

565
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,080
 Even if I want to dance, I don't know how to dance.

566
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,680
 But I did tell the Lord before,

567
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,040
 "Lord, whatever you say to me, confirm it by your word."

568
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,280
 And the word of the Lord came.

569
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,800
 David danced before the Lord.

570
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,840
 "Son, it's alright to dance."

571
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,120
 I was thinking, "But David is a Jew. I'm a Chinese Singaporean.

572
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,000
 The Jews dance all the time.

573
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,960
 My African brothers and sisters dance all the time.

574
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,840
 I'm a conservative Chinese Singaporean pastor.

575
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,640
 I don't do dance."

576
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,120
 But I did not argue with the Lord.

577
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
 So what do I do?

578
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:22,320
 I twirl around and dance the worst dance in the history of the Christian church.

579
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,120
 As I obeyed the Lord and worshipped Him and danced around,

580
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,440
 imagining how David would dance as he celebrated the Lord,

581
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,760
 suddenly the word of the Lord came to me.

582
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,640
 There's a woman, she's dressed in yellow.

583
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,560
 Her husband has just slapped her. Her heart is broken.

584
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,280
 Go to her and say three things.

585
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,120
 "I, the Lord, I'm your husband. I love you. I take care of you."

586
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,360
 I opened my eyes at the shock of my life.

587
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:50,040
 For some reason that night, there were so many women dressed in yellow.

588
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,560
 Can you imagine going to the wrong one?

589
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,120
 Your husband has just left you.

590
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,440
 "No, I'm not married."

591
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,080
 Your future husband.

592
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,840
 "I can't say that."

593
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,320
 Or your husband has just left you.

594
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,720
 "No, my husband is here."

595
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,880
 And she turned to her husband.

596
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
 "Are you thinking of leaving me?

597
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,160
 I cannot be party to domestic violence."

598
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,200
 So which one?

599
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,800
 By the time the service was over,

600
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,240
 I walked in the center aisle, looking left and right.

601
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,000
 So many women dressed in yellow.

602
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 "Lord, which one?"

603
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,320
 And the Lord spoke to me.

604
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,680
 "Son, I am not a God of confusion

605
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,960
 to show you that I've spoken to you.

606
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,160
 Your wife is already speaking to her."

607
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,080
 Whoa, faith rose in my heart.

608
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,960
 I walked to the front.

609
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,360
 I saw Anne speaking, the woman dressed in yellow.

610
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,200
 Anne was speaking.

611
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,640
 I stopped her and said, "Anne, can I speak to this lady?"

612
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,160
 I turned to her and said, "I want to tell you three things.

613
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,400
 Your husband has left you, but this is what the Lord says.

614
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,200
 Three things."

615
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,720
 He said, "I, the Lord, I'm your husband.

616
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,920
 I love you. I will take care of you."

617
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,840
 She began to cry.

618
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,400
 "It must be God.

619
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,480
 He takes a stranger who knows nothing about my deepest pain

620
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,800
 to tell me about the grace and the love of God."

621
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,040
 As she started to cry, Anne and I laid hands on her,

622
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,080
 prayed for her.

623
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,880
 I wish I have a video recorder

624
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,560
 to record the change in countenance.

625
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,920
 At first, there was sadness,

626
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,360
 and suddenly there was a glow,

627
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,600
 and there was a joy and a peace of the Lord that came.

628
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,840
 That night in the hotel room, Anne kept asking me,

629
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,040
 "How do you know? How do you know?"

630
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,600
 I said, "I dance."

631
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,280
 You know it's not the dancing.

632
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,680
 It is the willingness to lean in on God, to depend on God.

633
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,000
 I am not suggesting you do anything

634
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,400
 you think God is telling you to do.

635
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,960
 Remember what I said.

636
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720
 I said, "Lord, whatever you tell me to do,

637
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,240
 you confirm through the Scriptures.

638
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,200
 And when you confirm through the Scriptures, I will obey."

639
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,360
 When the Lord helps us in our wilderness

640
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,520
 to lean in on Him, to depend upon Him,

641
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,120
 to embrace these three prophetic words in Isaiah,

642
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,120
 "Behold your God!"

643
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,560
 You know what comes up in my heart

644
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,760
 every time I behold God?

645
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,040
 Gratitude.

646
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,440
 And that gratitude changes everything,

647
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,080
 even in my wilderness.

648
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,800
 Would you bow with me in prayer?

649
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,560
 Heavenly Father, when You tell us,

650
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,160
 "Prepare your heart,

651
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,120
 prepare the way of the Lord in the wilderness,"

652
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,440
 You are calling us to prepare our heart

653
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,120
 to lean in upon You,

654
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,040
 whatever may befall,

655
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,160
 because You are there in our wilderness.

656
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,400
 Your presence, Your provision,

657
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,400
 Your power may manifest.

658
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,640
 So help us, dear God, in this journey,

659
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,160
 in this pilgrimage of discipleship,

660
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,080
 that even in the wilderness,

661
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,680
 when we behold our God,

662
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,440
 there is victory and an overcoming faith.

663
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,720
 We thank You in Jesus' wonderful name.

664
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
 Amen.

665
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:05,720
