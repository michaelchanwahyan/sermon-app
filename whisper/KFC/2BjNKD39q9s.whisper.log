[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   And we have been going through the series called Charged.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   And Pastor James did a great job of going through
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   chapter one with us, talking about
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.200]   what would love have me do, right?
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.000]   If God is love, what would love have me do
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   in different situations, in tough situations?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.800]   What would God have me do?
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.800]   The second thing, the second part that we went through
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.000]   was with Pastor Michelle.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And she talked about the truth, upholding the truth.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   What is true understanding, true experience
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   so that we can have, so that we can be
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   the true vessel of God and share His word
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   to those around us.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   And in the second chapter of 1 Timothy,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   we are going through prayer today, prayer.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   And Paul talks about different types of prayer.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   He talks about the purpose of prayer,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   who prayers are, who is praying.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   He talks about the purpose of prayer, who prayer is for,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   the ultimate purpose, the ultimate goal of prayer.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And lastly, our attitude towards prayer.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   And so at the beginning on the call to worship,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   we read this verse, right?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Where Paul was urging Timothy, Paul was urging Timothy,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   first of all, the petitions, prayers, intercessions,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   thanksgiving be made for all people.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And so Paul, first of all, is talking about
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   different types of prayer, right?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   What are some of the things that you pray for
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   on a daily basis?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   What are different types of prayer you,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   what are the things you pray for?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Shout it out, come on.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   You don't pray?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   You don't pray?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   What do you pray for?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   What do you pray for?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Help, what else?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Huh?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Protection, shoes, James wants more shoes.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   The first thing that Paul says
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   is that we pray for supplication, right?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Or in the other version, it's called petitions.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And supplication is just God,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   supply us with the things that we need, right?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   We need help, we need shoes.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   God, help us.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   (laughing)
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Maybe too many shoes now.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   God, we have too many shoes, help us.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Another form of prayer is intercession.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Who's prayed for somebody that is in need this week?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Who's prayed for somebody in need?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Maybe we have friends that are sick.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Maybe you have friends that are going through
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   some emotional needs,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   who are going through something hard in life.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   We pray for people on a daily basis.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Intercession, Thanksgiving,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   what are you guys thankful for?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Health, what else?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Food, who said food?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Are you guys thinking about food already, huh?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   (laughing)
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   What are you guys thankful for?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   What else?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Friendship, family, Thanksgiving.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Paul is saying when we gather together,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   let's pray.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Let's pray for God to meet our needs.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Let's pray that God would help our friends and our family.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Let's thank God for the things that he's done in our life.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Back when I was in university and I was leading a group,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   we committed ourselves to having prayer meeting every day.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   9 a.m. in our office.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   These are some of the students
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   and I couldn't make it that day,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   and so they're showing me a photo that they were praying.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And we started off that day with prayer.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   We're giving up the day, offering it to the Lord.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   We would pray and thank God for who he is.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   We would pray and confess.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   We would thank God for the things he's done.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And then we would pray for the world.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   We would pray for the world.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   The Koreans have really made it a focus of their ministry.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Who has some friends that are Korean?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   In Toronto, there's a lot of Koreans.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And what they're sort of really focused on
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   is prayer in the morning.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   They would come together at the dawn of day, at 6 a.m.,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   to pray together.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Now, that might not be the generation now.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It might be the generation, you know,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   the younger generation.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   No, no, not the younger generation.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   The young and the younger generation.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   So not the younger generation, but the young generation.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   They came to pray every day, sometimes 4 or 5 a.m.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   The Koreans really focused on prayer.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And Paul wants us to focus on prayer too.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And why should we pray?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   What is the purpose of prayer?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Who should we be praying for?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   He says that we need to pray for all men.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Everyone needs to be prayed for.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   All people need to be prayed for.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Now, those who work in youth,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   who has worked in youth before,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   or university students or whatnot,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   you love it.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   You know, when you come together in a group,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   and at the end, you wanna pray together,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   and you ask these kids,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   "Oh, what do you want us to pray for you?"
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And sometimes they say, "I'm good."
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Have you guys gotten that before?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I'm good, right?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I'm good.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Like, God, I'm good.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And so I tell them, "Yeah, let's pray for your perfect life.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   "Let's pray for your perfect life without sin,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   "without conflict,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   "'cause, you know, obviously,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   "you need especially, you need especially,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   "you especially need prayer."
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Sorry.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Sorry, I got tongue twisted there.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Paul goes on and says this to us,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   "But we need to pray for kings
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   "and all those in authority,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   "that we may live peaceful and quiet lives
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   "in all godliness and holiness."
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And so Paul was obviously writing this letter to Timothy.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   And as Pastor James explained to us, he was in Ephesus.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And in Ephesus,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   who was sort of in charge at that time, it was Rome.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It was Caesar.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And the Christians, a lot of times, they had conflict,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   because Caesar was supposed to be like God, right?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And so if you didn't follow exactly what Caesar did,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   you were disobeying their God.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And so the Christians had conflict, right?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   They didn't always follow what Caesar said.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And so because of that, Paul is urging them to pray.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Paul is urging them to pray for their leaders,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   that they may live peaceful and quiet lives
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   in godliness and holiness.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Back then, Paul's urge to them
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   was to live peaceful and quiet lives
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   in godliness and holiness.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And obviously, we all have political leaders that we love,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   or sometimes we're not really agreeing with.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   But Paul is asking us, God is asking us,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   that we pray for our leaders.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   We pray for our leaders.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   The standard he sets here is this,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   that we may live lives of godliness and holiness.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And so how can we live lives of godliness and holiness
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   in our situation?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And we need to be sensitive to the Spirit,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   how the Spirit leads us,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   so that we can live godly and holy lives for the Lord.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Next, Paul tells us of the ultimate goal of prayer.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And it says in verse five, right?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Verse four, and then verse three and four, and then five.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   "This is good and pleases God our Savior,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   "who wants all people to be saved
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   "and come to the knowledge of the truth."
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Paul, first of all, says, this is good and it pleases God.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   The ultimate goal of prayer is to please God.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Does God know everything?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Does He know what you're gonna pray before you pray it?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   He does.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   He does.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   But God wants us to have a relationship with Him,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   connect with Him on a daily basis.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Yes, He knows what we're gonna pray.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   He knows our need.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   He is a Father
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   that will guide us, protect us.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Even the sparrows are well-fed.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Even the flowers are more beautiful than anything
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   that is dressed,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   any of Solomon's dresses or outfits.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   God knows our need,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   but He wants us to pray because it pleases Him
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   to connect with Him.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And the second thing is,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   "For there is one God and one mediator
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   "between God and mankind,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   "the man Christ Jesus,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   "who gave Himself as a ransom for all people."
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Jesus gave Himself for us.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   The ultimate goal of prayer
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   is that people would be saved, all would be saved,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   and to come to the knowledge of the truth,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   that Jesus is the truth,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   the way, the life, and the truth.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   There is no other way to Jesus, to the Father,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   except through Him.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Jesus is our mediator.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   He gave up Himself
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   so that we could connect with the Father.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   And so we need to be praying
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   for people to come to know Jesus.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Have you guys been praying
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   for some of your friends and your family
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   to come to know Jesus?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Have you?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Yes.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   I remember back in university
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   and we had this Christian group.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Every year we would set a goal.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   We wanna be praying.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   For example, we wanna see 50 students
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   come to know Jesus this school semester.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And so we would pray every week
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   that students would come to know Jesus diligently.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And we would pray that through our events,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   whether it be a "Does God exist?" debate,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   whether it be a "Can a scientist believe in God?" event,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   or just one-on-one going out and doing good work
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   and social events,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   that people would come to know Jesus,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   students would come to know Jesus.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And that's what we did when we were in university.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   We prayed diligently
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   for students to come to know Jesus.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And Paul is charging Timothy
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   that when they gather together, when they pray,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   their ultimate goal
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   must be that people would come to know Jesus,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   that all would be saved,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   come to the knowledge of the truth,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   and that there is only one mediator,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   and that is Jesus himself.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Next, he talks about the attitude of prayer.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And let's read together verse eight to 10.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Let's read together.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   One, two, three.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   (audience chattering)
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   "Lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   "I also want the women to dress modestly
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   "with decency and propriety,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   "adorning themselves not with elaborate hairstyles
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   "or gold or pearls, expensive clothes,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   "but all goodies appropriate for women
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   "to profess to worship God."
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   All right, so now we're going to a part of the passage
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   that is a bit more tricky.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Now, the passage after this, the end of the chapter,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   there's some controversy to it,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   the different roles of men and women in the church.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Now, today, our focus will be on prayer.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   We don't have enough time to address the roles specifically,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   but we're gonna just focus on the prayer aspect of it.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And so we're just gonna go through this section of it.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And what Paul is doing here is he is focusing
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   on some of the concerns of the different genders of that day.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   So firstly, with men, he's telling them to lift holy hands.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Right, lift holy hands and pray without anger or disputing.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Now, in the Old Testament, they lifted holy hands.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   They lifted hands when they prayed, right?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Ezra did that, David did that in the temple.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Lifting holy hands is a sign of surrender,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   devotion to the Lord, right?
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Holy hands are, we need to set apart our lives for the Lord.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   The problem with some of the men of that time was that
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   they dealt with anger, okay?
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   They were dealing with anger.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Some of them were very self-righteous.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   They had to be right.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   You know, sort of like our (speaks in foreign language)
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Right, we need to be men, we are always right.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Right, and so some of the problems of that time
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   during Timothy and Paul was that these men sometimes
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   would pray prayers that would be angry prayers, right?
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Oh, Lord, forgive James for not passing me the ball
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   at basketball.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Forgive him, Lord, repent.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Help him to repent of his ways.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   They had to be right, you know?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   The Greeks and especially some of those philosophers
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   and theologians, philosophers back then,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   they wanted to be right.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   That's what they strived for.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And sometimes they would use prayer
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   to go against the other person they were disputing.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And they would use prayer to make themselves right.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And so Paul is saying, no, lift yourself up with holy hands
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   and pray to the Lord, surrender to the Lord.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Don't use prayer to win your arguments.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Don't use prayer to start disputes.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Prayer should be focused on the Lord.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Prayer should be focused on the Lord.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And so that was what Paul was encouraging
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   the men of that time to do.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Now, he continues and says that the women
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   should dress modestly with decency and propriety.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Decency and propriety.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And so some of the women of that time,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   maybe they were really well-dressed, right?
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, expensive clothes.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Now, if you come to church nowadays with braids
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   or what is it again?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Sorry, elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   We wouldn't think that much of it, right?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   I mean, that's sort of normal.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   People wear gold chains, people have interesting hairstyles.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   I mean, it's true.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Some people wear expensive clothes.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Some people wear expensive...
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I don't know whose hairstyle is more elaborate
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   or I don't know.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   That can be up to interpretation.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   So Paul is reminding the women of that time.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Maybe they were coming, it was like a red carpet
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   every time they went to church, right?
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   They wore all their best dresses
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   and all the craziest hairstyles, elaborate hairstyles.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Maybe it was like, you know, the Emmy Awards
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   every time they went to prayer meeting
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   or something like that.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   So Paul was reminding the women.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   It's not about outer appearance.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   It's about God.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And so what does propriety mean?
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   It means, is it proper, right?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Is it appropriate for the meeting?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Am I overdressed or underdressed?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Is it gonna cause inappropriate attention to myself?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   So Paul is reminding the women of that time,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   propriety, decency and modesty.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Is it moderate?
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Is it too much or too little?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Where is the middle ground?
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And, you know, sometimes we have to remind our youth
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   at the youth service, you know, to dress modestly
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   'cause the trends of this world, you know,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   are not super modest nowadays.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And so is he, is Paul saying,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   "No, you gotta dress ugly."
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   You know, is that what Paul is saying?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   No, Paul is not saying you gotta come ugly and not ugly.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Paul is saying, "Dress appropriately.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   "Use the wisdom that God has given you.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   "Be led by the Holy Spirit."
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And these things were especially addressed
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   to men and women of that time.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   But actually it could go both ways, right?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Men, you need to dress decently as well.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   How would it be if I just came on stage unbuttoned
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   and preached the sermon?
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Would it be modest?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Would it be decent?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   No.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Men also have to practise, right?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   He agrees, you know, yeah.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Right, men also have to go through this, right?
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Women, you know, sometimes you could be angry
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   in prayer as well, I'm not sure.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Ask him.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Paul is addressing these things
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   specifically for those people at those times.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   But his ultimate goal
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   is that he wants our attitude to be fixed on God,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   not ourselves.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   When we meet together to pray,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   it shouldn't be about disputing.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   It shouldn't be about, you know,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   causing gossip, causing gossip.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   It shouldn't be about, oh, I gotta be
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   the most well-dressed person in this prayer meeting
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   or I have to have the most elaborate hairstyle
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   in this meeting.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Our focus when we pray together,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   as we come together in worship,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   is that we be fixed on Jesus Christ.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Amen?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Amen.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And so we've gone through prayer today,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   the different types of prayer,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   the purpose of prayer.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   We pray for men, we pray for our leaders.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   We seek God's guidance in how we be Christians
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   in this time, in this age.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Our ultimate goal of prayer is to please God.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Is to have our friends and our family
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   and people come to know Jesus.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And lastly, our attitude towards prayer
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   should be focused on him.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Not on ourselves, not on winning disputes,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   not on gossiping, not on how amazing we're dressed.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Our eyes need to be fixed on Jesus when we pray.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And that should be our attitude.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   That should be our attitude.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   And so as we conclude,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   let me ask you a question.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   How is your prayer life?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   How is your prayer life?
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Are you praying more to God?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Or are you depending more on yourself?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Are you praying more to God?
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Or are you depending more on yourself?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Hudson Saylor has this quote.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   "When we work, we work.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   "When we pray, God works."
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   You guys all know I'm a doer.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   I've said this many times.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   I love doing many things, right?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Whether it be ministry,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   or be in this fellowship, that fellowship,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   this fellowship, that fellowship,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   share the gospel here, whatever.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Do a lot of things, do a lot of sports, right?
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   And the problem with doing
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   is that I sometimes forget about why I'm doing it
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   and who I'm depending on to do these things.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   And I need to stop myself
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   when I'm doing too much,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   especially when I'm doing too much,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   to sit down and connect with the person
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   that is seeking after me.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   I'm chasing all these different things,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   but the one person that is chasing after me is God.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And we need to connect with God.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   In such a busy city, with busy schedules,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   we need to connect with God and humble ourselves.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Prayer is us humbling ourselves before an infinite God
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   and saying that we need you, God.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   We surrender ourselves to you.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   We depend on you to provide for us.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   We depend on you for protecting our families.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   We depend on you ultimately for salvation,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   for what you've done on the cross.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Are you depending on yourself more
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   than you are praying to God and connecting with him?
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   And lastly, is the ultimate goal of our prayers
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   the salvation of others?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Have we been praying for our friends, our family,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   our loved ones, our leaders,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   that they would come to know Jesus?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Have we been praying for them?
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   I remember my dad, right?
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   He was the first to know Jesus in our family.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And when he was in high school,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   he had a calling from God to go into seminary.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And my grandmother was just like, "Don't go, don't go."
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   And my dad, and grandfather,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   dad was like threatening to kick him out of the house.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   "Don't go."
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   My dad chose to follow Jesus,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   to follow God, go to seminary.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   And it wasn't until 15 or 20 years later
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   that my grandparents came to know Jesus
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   when they came to visit us in Canada.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   God has his time and his way.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Are we trusting in him more than we trust ourselves?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Let's invite the worship team to come up.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Before we respond,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   before we respond in song,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   I just want to take some time for us to pray.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   If you've depended on yourself too much,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   you've forgotten God,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   let it be a time where you just confess,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   "God, this is where I'm at.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   "You know my heart, you know my weaknesses.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   "Just confess it to the Lord."
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Or maybe God has placed somebody on your heart
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   that really needs Jesus.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   That God would open up opportunities
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   for you to connect with them about Jesus, about God.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Maybe bring them to Alpha.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Maybe help them to try church one time.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Let's spend some time with our creator
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   and just connect with Him in prayer.
