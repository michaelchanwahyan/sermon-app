[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.960]   Hi KFCI and Happy New Year. I love this sermon each year. It is quite possibly, no, probably
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:30.720]   my favourite sermon of the year. At the beginning of each year, we get an opportunity to ask
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:42.560]   ourselves the question, "Where are we?" and "Where are we going?" I, and indeed our whole
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:53.680]   KFCI team, get the chance to go away and pray, to listen to God and to try to ascertain His
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:03.240]   direction for us. Now this year, our trip to the UK to be close to Sandra's father has
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:11.560]   afforded me an unexpected opportunity to seek God's face away from the hustle and bustle
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:19.400]   of Hong Kong that I hadn't bargained for. Indeed, I was at a church service in Camarden
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:28.160]   in South Wales when a young man came and gave me a prophecy that the time away would give
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:37.640]   me an eagle's view of Hong Kong. He saw the people of Hong Kong as young chicks. As we
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:46.960]   know, the eagle has the best vision, the best eyesight of any living creature. I felt that
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:02:02.240]   God gave me three words, "Us, you, and them." You say, "Big deal. That's not a very dramatic
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:12.680]   revelation." To make it worse, I've given you a picture, a diagram of those three words,
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:23.360]   "Us, you, and them." But let me explain. By "us," I refer to the pastors of the church.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:32.440]   There is a call to us as pastors to be ready for all that God wants us to be and to do
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:44.360]   as a church. That means discovering or rediscovering our gift, our calling, and operating in it.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.480]   That means proper preparation for all that God has got for us as a church and for our
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:02.520]   city. That means unity with other pastors and clergy, other churches, and end to division
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:16.080]   and denominationalism. By "you," I refer to the congregations of our churches. You, that
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:28.280]   means recognizing that all of you are gifted. That means us equipping you. We don't want
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:36.040]   church to be about a few pastors doing everything, potentially getting burnt out, with you sitting
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:46.760]   in the pews, okay, in the chairs, allowing us to do this. So that means proper training
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   to allow you to be effective ministers of the gospel. And that is the first key reason
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:06.640]   for this series. It is our vision to have you equipped as ministers. I attended a church
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.160]   in Shatin one Sunday and was given a bulletin. The first thing I noticed was this. It said
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:29.720]   this, "Pastor, Reverend Stephen Turey, ministers, everybody else, you are a minister. You need
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:40.760]   to be," why? "For them. By them, I refer to the community, those outside of our church
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:49.400]   buildings." William Temple, the famous 20th century historian and archbishop, said this,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.880]   "The church is the only institution that exists primarily for the benefit of those
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:06.480]   who are not its members." That means us being aware of the needs in our society. That means
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.840]   us willing to get up out of our church seats and to do something about it. That means being
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:26.440]   trained and equipped to do this effectively. Let me talk about Goldbrook Church. We are
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:34.960]   privileged to be part of this church. One church, three languages. A church content
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:44.560]   not to just be, but to go. A well-respected Cantonese church that had a vision in 2016
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:52.120]   to start an English service. A church that last year had a vision for mental health.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:01.280]   You may remember on the 1st of January, 2022, I spoke on health for all, all for God. We
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:09.640]   had a sermon series, wellness seminars, mental health ambassadors. As we reinforced the message,
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:19.200]   it's okay to not be okay. This year, Goldbrook Church has discerned that our vision is to
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:31.240]   be equipping the saints, serving the community. Let me repeat that. Equipping the saints,
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:42.520]   serving the community. KFCI is pleased to 100% support this vision. It is not just to
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:53.200]   be a slogan, but a way of life. And in that vein, today's sermon will set the scene for
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:03.560]   2023 and introduce the sermon themes for the first half of the year. Our first series will
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:12.720]   be called equipping the saints. Straight after that, we will go into the one campaign. And
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:19.960]   then we will embark on a sermon series called serving the community. They will draw on various
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:30.920]   themes and biblical passages with a special emphasis on Ephesians 4.12 to equip the saints
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:39.480]   for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ. And Hebrews 10, 24 to
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:47.880]   25, and let us consider how we might spur one another on towards love and good deeds,
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.120]   not giving up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:08:00.160]   other and all the more as you see the day approaching. Let me share some of the things
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:09.720]   that you'll be hearing. Next week, we will have a special guest speaker, Dr. Seth Kim.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:18.160]   He lives, eats and breathes church unity. We work very closely together on things like
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:26.620]   initiatives like the one campaign, movement day and next move. He runs an amazing church
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:33.120]   in Hong Kong, Harvest Mission Gospel Church, mainly reaching out to university students
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:44.920]   and young adults. Now, why is that? Well, before Paul begins to teach about equipping,
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:52.180]   he speaks at length about unity in the body of Christ. Although this is a theme we've
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:57.900]   touched upon often, and we'll of course follow this up, this series with the one campaign.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:07.360]   It is essential that we cover this before we even try to get to first base in equipping
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:16.160]   the saints. The week after that, January 21st, will be our own Pastor Johnny. We'll be of
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.040]   course preparing for Lunar New Year. And as we prepare for Lunar New Year, we'll be using
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:28.600]   Jesus' experience in the wilderness, his temptation by the devil and his emergence
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:36.800]   empowered by the Holy Spirit as a first base for equipping. You know, Jesus took 30 years,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:46.480]   30 years to prepare for a three year ministry, 10 times longer sharpening the axe as he did
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:54.240]   cutting down trees. And yet, following his graduation ceremony in the River Jordan at
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:03.440]   his baptism, there was still an important final preparation in the wilderness. We see
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:12.360]   how Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness and returned in the power of
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:23.120]   the Spirit. We have to be prepared before we embark on equipping. We can take a closer
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:32.240]   look at Satan's temptations and how he attempts to contradict the Father's promises over him
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:40.640]   and indeed us. I will be speaking the following week, January 28th, and this is perhaps the
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.480]   fulcrum of the series. It includes our key verse, verse 12, to equip the saints for the
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:53.120]   work of the ministry, for building up the body of Christ. This verse is like a bridge
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:11:00.840]   between Paul's description of the five-fold ministry, the offices of the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:08.400]   and the passage in verses 13 to 16, which describes beautifully why we need to equip
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:20.120]   the saints. The bridge leads us to how we are equipped. Then we are going to get two
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:29.120]   how-to sermons from two gifted servants the Lord has brought to this church. First year
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:36.040]   on February 4th, Pastor Johnny will be talking on witness. Johnny is an evangelist, full
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:45.800]   stop. In 2022, he led literally tens of people, many young people, to faith in Christ. But
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:54.680]   we have a problem. In the second half of 2023, Johnny will be on sabbatical. So, do we pause
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:00.600]   on evangelism while he's away? If someone wants to get saved, do we ask them to wait
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:12.680]   until Johnny returns? No. No, no, no. And Johnny will be sharing a practical sermon
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:20.600]   on how you can witness and share your faith. And then on February 11th, we have Pastor
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:29.120]   James. Pastor James is a pastor teacher, full stop. One thing that I love about him, he
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:37.240]   preaches like I sing without any real notes. He is one of my, he's one of our favorite
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:44.400]   preachers in the whole world. But as we shared a few months back, we have empowered him and
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:52.040]   Christina and their team to pioneer our family gathering on Sunday mornings. I'm pleased
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:13:02.800]   to say it's going really well as we seek to reach out to young parents and their children.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:10.480]   Now what that means is invariably he is preaching less here on Saturday nights. That has provided
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:21.380]   opportunities for our G5 speakers and others. But we want to equip you to be able to teach
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:32.760]   God's word as James shares a practical sermon on how to teach the gospel.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:38.840]   After this series, we will be joined for one campaign with thousands of churches around
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:45.560]   the world. Most of them will be adopting the teaching series on the parables of Jesus from
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:52.680]   Luke's gospel. And there will be small group material for our clans and weekly videos to
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:14:00.600]   back this up. It is an eight week series. I've shown it here and I'm so looking forward
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:14.120]   to it. And after Easter, from April the 15th on, hopefully equipped, hopefully one, we
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:23.880]   will move to serving the community. A series that will be as practical as much as it teaches.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:33.440]   We will partner Hong Kong NGOs and demonstrate for them as we move from you to them. Having
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:42.560]   previously moved from us to you. I am convinced it will be like no other sermon series we've
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:55.080]   ever had before. Watch this space. Equipping the saints, serving the community. In the
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:03.180]   minutes that remain, I want to, as it were, put this in context. And in particular, focus
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:12.420]   on my text for today, Ephesians 4.12. I'll read it again. To equip the saints for the
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:19.660]   work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ. I believe that this
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:26.860]   verse and indeed others that we'll be looking at during this series is in essence, the follow
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:36.380]   up of what God has done on the cross through Jesus Christ. It describes the purpose that
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:43.900]   God has for his people. We would maybe have expected the resurrected Lord Jesus to remain
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:53.500]   on earth, but he didn't. Instead, we know that Christ's spirit came upon his people
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:16:04.100]   and lived through them. Christ is living himself out through our lives. Christ's plan A for
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:14.380]   the world is the church. He does not have a plan B. And so Christ in a real way is living
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:24.180]   his life out on earth through our lives. This is the concept we see in Christ being called
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:37.620]   the head and Christians being called his body. We are good stewards when we understand and
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:48.460]   cooperate with Christ's purpose. Christ established this extension of his ministry through working
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:58.960]   in each of our lives. We will see how this takes shape in our series. A major shaper
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:05.900]   that has impacted every believer is the way that Christ has distributed his spiritual
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:19.040]   gifts to his people. But, and it's a big but, we must not be content on having those
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:25.220]   gifted servants like Johnny, like James, like Michelle, like Paul, like Bonnie, that the
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:36.660]   Lord has brought to our church and allow church to simply be a service we attend. Yes, it
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:44.660]   is right to appreciate them and their gifting. But if we pay them to do all the serious work
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:54.940]   of the church, we miserably fail. The church is severely malformed because we have separated
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:01.060]   those who pastor and teach from the rest of the congregation. Now, of course, there is
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:11.140]   a real difference between the equipers and the saints, but it is not as most people imagine.
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:19.740]   Paul states that a certain group are equipers. They are there to help everyone else to do
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:29.060]   effectively do their work. But most churches I have found want to hire a pastor to do the
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:37.900]   work of the church. Tick the box, job done. They want to believe that the clergy are holy
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.500]   in a different sense to the people. Like when I go to eat with fellow Christians and they
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:50.700]   want me to say grace before dinner as if my grace is better than yours. The malformation,
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:58.860]   the deformity of the church has become so accentuated today that a pastor can often
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:06.980]   be evaluated on how much he makes the audience comfortable and laugh rather than equipping
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:17.060]   them. Yes, do note that I said audience rather than congregation. People often revolve around
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:28.460]   the entertainer rather than before the Lord. Ephesians 4.12 gives us a wholly different
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:38.220]   concept that many of us are shocked at when we begin to understand it. And it's in the
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:48.340]   word saint. Paul's use of the word saints here should totally eradicate this clergy
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:20:00.020]   laity concept. All of God's people are holy and expected to serve him. The goal of having
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:06.820]   such instructors is to empower, enable the saints so that they can serve. They bring
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:16.340]   the word of God to our lives so that everyone in the congregation can serve. Saints is not
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:25.260]   meant to be a term describing the few chosen virtuous Christians, but rather a term that
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:34.860]   includes all, all Christians. As we see in Ephesians chapter one, all Christians are
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:44.660]   chosen. All Christians are called and all Christians are thus set apart for the Lord.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:55.140]   All genuine Christians are saints. Even the apostles, prophets, etc. are considered saints.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:03.540]   This group of instructors then are a subset of the larger group of Christians. But much
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:16.740]   more important are the words here, "He gave to equip the saints for the work of ministry,
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:25.680]   for building up the body of Christ." A certain number of individuals are specially gifted
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:34.300]   to enable all the saints to do the work. This verse follows Paul describing apostles, prophets,
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:45.100]   evangelists, and teacher pastors. The phrase "work of ministry" in verse 12 might be
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:53.660]   defined in many ways, but the more important aspect is to recognize that actually each
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:22:02.740]   and every Christian can and must be transformed into a servant of Christ. Hence the motivation
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:10.240]   for this sermon series. I like to think of God's purpose to work through the church in
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:16.700]   two ways. First of all, we all, the whole church, are an amplification of Christ to
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:23.900]   the world. Since we are many, Christ's love and healing can be introduced to many people
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:30.380]   at one time rather than the crowd mentality so prevalent in the New Testament. People
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:39.260]   would crowd around Jesus trying to touch him. Secondly, it is helpful to think on the individual
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:46.620]   level where Christ in his glory wants to live through our lives. We might be, and to be
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:57.100]   honest, a nobody, but because Christ lives in us, we become a wonderful and awesome contact
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:08.140]   for others to meet God's love. That's true whether we meet up with a Christian or a non-Christian.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:14.320]   We can always radiate God's love and utilize our special spiritual gifts for the building
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:20.300]   up of the body of Christ. We're not just different people meeting together in the fellowship
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:29.940]   hall of the Far East Finance Center, but different parts of Christ's body. We need each other
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:39.820]   so that we can individually can be built up and as a whole fully display Christ's glorious
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:48.380]   love. When the church begins to understand this, it stops its arguments and criticism
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:56.280]   and steps ahead in faith and love. It begins to value others rather than just putting up
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:02.060]   with them. Even when there are difficulties amongst us with other people, the individual
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:11.780]   is not to focus on what he or she gets, but gives. The Lord already gave to the saints.
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:22.300]   Now they are to give. They can do the work of service just as Christ did. It is us to
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:35.540]   you, to them in practice. As the church puts itself behind the imperfection of others and
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:45.140]   focuses on building each other up, the whole community begins to radically grow. The world
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:56.980]   begins to notice. They will want to know the God that we serve. We can serve each other
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:04.680]   just as Christ served us and thus finish building up the body of Christ. The goal of the church
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:17.080]   then is to make sure it equips each saint to participate in the ministry. So in conclusion,
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:31.500]   this one small verse, Ephesians 4.12, clearly maps out God's design for his church. He enables
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:39.240]   the church to reflect his love and truth in the world. As we awaken to the glorious and
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:46.000]   most gracious calling for the church to serve him, we are all the more moved at the love
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.240]   and grace of God towards our own lives. Instead of growing in pride, we are humbled that God
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:01.920]   would work in our lives in such a wonderful fashion. When the people of God catch the
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:09.700]   truth and the love of God as shown in his great plan for the people of God, we awaken
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:25.440]   in his love and humbly come before him, astonished at the love and glory of Christ. A warning,
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:38.680]   I'm going to get passionate now. I need you to see what I see. Now, now is the time for
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:47.360]   a change. God wants to reveal the glory of Christ in his body now. That means that God
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   is looking for opportunities to reveal his glory through his people. It is why us to
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:06.680]   you to them has to be our vision, the way forward. Again and again, we need to return
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:12.840]   to the process through which this unity of faith, this knowledge of the son of God and
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:20.520]   this maturity comes about. It will come through both the right instructions of apostles, prophets,
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:27.560]   evangelists, and pastor teachers, but also from God's people who have caught the vision
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:38.200]   of what they can be in Christ. My dear friends and fellow church members, I will be 70 years
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:50.800]   of age in a few short months, three score years and 10. I love the church with all my
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:28:06.520]   heart, every brick of it. I love the church as it is, but I love the church too much to
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:13.760]   leave it as it is. I recognize that God has gifted me. He's put his hand upon me for this
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:27.640]   important moment, but I recognize that this gifting is for what? For equipping the saints.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:37.760]   Equipping the saints. But then again, I recognize that this equipping is for what? To serve
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:58.200]   the community, to serve the community. Us is to become you, is to become them. That
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:09.680]   is my vision for 2023 and beyond. Thank you. God bless you.
