1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,720
 Can you believe it's the middle of November,

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,400
 2020 is nearly gone and you go into the shops now

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,160
 and you see Christmas decorations, things to buy.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,280
 During Christmas time I particularly think

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,800
 a lot about England.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,520
 There's much more of an English Christmas vibe,

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,840
 well there's a lot more of a Christmas vibe going on

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,660
 in England.

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,040
 Hong Kong just has lots of nice big trees

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,480
 and decorations inside the malls, right.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,660
 But when I'm thinking about England and the Christmas,

13
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,520
 I think the Christmas we had before we came to Hong Kong,

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
 we went to a place called Litchfield Cathedral

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,160
 to watch the snowman, an orchestral performance

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,000
 of the snowman.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,680
 It was a wonderful time, it just makes me think,

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,360
 oh, just Christmas is so nice.

19
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,880
 But as I was thinking about the different,

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,740
 actually England is full of big, beautiful churches.

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,240
 I don't know if you've been to England

22
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,280
 and you'll see all these huge cathedrals

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,320
 and these are just such beautiful pieces of architecture.

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,200
 And as I was preparing this message here,

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,180
 there was one that really popped into my mind.

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,200
 And when I went to study in the University of Leeds,

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,720
 there was one near the main entrance of the university,

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,620
 near the Parkinson building.

29
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,240
 And it was again, a beautiful building

30
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,240
 and they're everywhere, even in the small villages

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,600
 and towns and cities.

32
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,120
 And I walked past it and then you know what the name

33
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,520
 of this church building was, what was outside?

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,880
 A nice big sign, the name of the church was,

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,120
 not St. Peter's, not St. Andrew's, it was Halo.

36
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,440
 And I'm like, oh, that's an interesting name for a church.

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,400
 I mean, I guess it's kind of religious,

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,240
 but that's a bit weird.

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,400
 And it turns out this wasn't really a church anymore.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,480
 It was supposed to be a church,

41
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,080
 it was a church at the beginning,

42
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,800
 but now it was a nightclub.

43
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,620
 That had appropriately called themselves Halo.

44
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,040
 I guess if I was an unbeliever and I'd acquired

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
 a church building to run my nightclub,

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,440
 Halo is a pretty cool name.

47
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,520
 And then it made me think, there are so,

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,680
 and those of you from England will know,

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,480
 there are so, so many churches, church buildings,

50
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,480
 sorry, in England, that are no longer housing churches,

51
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,160
 but they are housing nightclubs and community centres

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,440
 and all these different things.

53
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,160
 And as I was looking at this passage today,

54
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,760
 it really reminded me of that church building

55
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,280
 that is now called Halo.

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,480
 This idea that there's a church that was the body of Christ

57
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,240
 that had this reputation for being alive, but was now dead.

58
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,360
 And as I read through this passage today,

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,120
 my prayer for all of us is as we read through this letter

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,800
 to the church in Sardis from Jesus Christ himself,

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,440
 that we will take heed from some of the things

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,920
 that he tells this church,

63
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,000
 because this church hit home into my heart.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
 I'd love to read it to you now first.

65
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,200
 Revelation chapter three, verse one to six.

66
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,600
 And to the angel of the church in Sardis,

67
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,680
 write the words of him who has the seven spirits of God

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,200
 and the seven stars.

69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,840
 I know your works.

70
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,040
 You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead.

71
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,920
 Wake up and strengthen what remains and is about to die,

72
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,400
 for I have not found your works complete

73
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
 in the sight of my God.

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,360
 Remember then what you have received and heard.

75
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,640
 Keep it and repent.

76
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,080
 If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief

77
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,320
 and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.

78
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,360
 Yet you still have a few names in Sardis,

79
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,240
 people who have not sold their garments

80
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,560
 and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.

81
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,800
 The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments

82
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,520
 and I will never blot his name out of the book of life.

83
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,800
 I will confess his name before my father

84
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,840
 and before his angels.

85
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,520
 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says

86
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,800
 to the churches.

87
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,000
 This is the word of the Lord.

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,720
 Actually, before I continue, can I pray for us?

89
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,880
 As we dissect and look at these verses here,

90
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,240
 my prayer is that the Spirit of God

91
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,080
 will really be speaking into our hearts.

92
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,160
 Let's just pray again.

93
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:11,200
 God, as we were singing to you

94
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,240
 and as we were worshipping you,

95
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,640
 that final song and those lyrics,

96
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,840
 just, "Yet not I, but Christ in me."

97
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,520
 And Jesus, I know that these words that you wrote

98
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,480
 to the church in Sardis are the words

99
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,480
 that you are speaking to us right now,

100
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,280
 both as a body and as individuals.

101
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,000
 And so I pray that your Spirit will continue

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,840
 to speak into our hearts and that we won't just listen,

103
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,360
 thinking that this is for somebody else.

104
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,320
 But Lord, that we know that this is from you,

105
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,520
 not me, from you to us, to all of us.

106
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,360
 We thank you for this chance to go through this.

107
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,960
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

108
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,560
 So Sardis was an interesting kind of city.

109
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,240
 It was a former royal town.

110
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,800
 It was found, it was in a valley,

111
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,000
 but it was at the top of a little steep spur in the valley.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,760
 And it was a very wealthy town.

113
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,200
 It had a reputation for being a very wealthy town.

114
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,000
 King, many kings had stayed there,

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,480
 but it was also invaded by many different people.

116
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,120
 But there's really not much else we know about this city.

117
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,880
 Now, the other churches,

118
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,600
 out of the letters that Jesus writes,

119
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,080
 we know quite a bit of context.

120
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,880
 With Sardis, we don't know much.

121
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,640
 The only thing we know about Sardis

122
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,760
 is that it was invaded quite a few times.

123
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,360
 So it was captured by foreign nations.

124
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,280
 And another is that within the church,

125
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,160
 there wasn't really any false teaching.

126
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,840
 There wasn't any false heresy like the other churches had.

127
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
 And another thing was,

128
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,120
 they also didn't really have any persecution.

129
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
 They were actually quite a comfortable church.

130
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
 So these are some of the key factors

131
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,760
 as you look at this church in Sardis.

132
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,160
 But what's interesting is,

133
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
 there's no false teaching, there's no persecution,

134
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,920
 yet it is the most damning of them all

135
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,440
 in terms of the letter, in terms of the rebuke.

136
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,760
 Jesus, we talked about the poo sandwich last time,

137
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,080
 where it's constructive feedback,

138
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,240
 where you have a bit of encouragement,

139
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,600
 then you have the really bad stuff,

140
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,520
 and then you have an encouragement

141
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,440
 just to finish at the end.

142
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,280
 With Sardis, there is nothing.

143
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,000
 It is just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,080
 And this is a church that we know really know nothing about.

145
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,720
 So what that is really interesting

146
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,880
 as we look at this passage.

147
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
 And it starts off, verse one.

148
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,640
 "And to the angel of the church in Sardis write

149
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,680
 "the words of him who has the seven spirits of God

150
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,920
 "and the seven stars."

151
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,640
 That really here is referring to Jesus is the one who,

152
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,200
 and it is Jesus' spirit that is speaking.

153
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,800
 It's the complete Holy Spirit

154
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,560
 is speaking to this church in Sardis.

155
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,840
 It is practically the same as the other ones

156
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,160
 where it says the one who holds the stars,

157
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,760
 the one who holds the lampstands,

158
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,120
 who walks amongst the lampstands is saying here,

159
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,360
 the Holy Spirit is speaking to this church.

160
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
 Jesus talked about this, John 16, eight.

161
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,560
 "And the Holy Spirit will come into the world

162
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,120
 "and convict the world of sin and righteousness."

163
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,960
 The Holy Spirit is coming to this church

164
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,400
 and telling them what they are doing right and wrong.

165
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,560
 And then it starts.

166
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,760
 "I know your works."

167
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,200
 We've seen that before.

168
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,680
 Jesus is saying, I know what you guys are doing.

169
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,000
 You are good people.

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,560
 You have good programs.

171
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,320
 You have good outreach initiatives.

172
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,480
 You are doing good stuff.

173
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,400
 I know that you have works and I know what they are,

174
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,400
 but you have the reputation of being alive,

175
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,560
 but you are dead.

176
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,720
 And I wanted to share the four observations

177
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,960
 that I have with you first.

178
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,640
 I'll list them all first so you know where we're going

179
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,400
 so you can track a little bit easier.

180
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,160
 And the four observations I had

181
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,800
 from these six verses is this.

182
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,920
 The first one is this.

183
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,080
 Reputation is not reality.

184
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,400
 Reputation is not reality.

185
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,840
 Number two, remember what you have received.

186
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,160
 That's what Jesus is telling them.

187
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,920
 Number three, repent or be removed.

188
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,880
 And finally, he does finish on a positive note.

189
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,040
 Reward awaits the resilient.

190
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,680
 So if you were to sum these six verses down,

191
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,040
 I know I'm not really doing much.

192
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,440
 I'm just going from six down to four,

193
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,240
 but this is essentially what Jesus is saying.

194
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,520
 And we'll start with the first one.

195
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,560
 Reputation is not reality.

196
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,440
 And he says here, you have the reputation

197
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,440
 of being alive, verse one still, but you are dead.

198
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,400
 Have you ever based some of your decisions on reputation

199
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,920
 and then been left disappointed?

200
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,240
 In England, this happens more if someone tells us,

201
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,280
 hey, there's a nice restaurant

202
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,280
 that you should go and try and eat.

203
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,360
 It's got a good reputation.

204
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,480
 And then you go and it's like, oh, it really wasn't that nice.

205
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,920
 I should have gone to Nando's.

206
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,320
 (audience laughing)

207
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,560
 Right?

208
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,400
 'Cause Nando's isn't the best, but it's just safe.

209
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,240
 But that's England.

210
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,800
 In Hong Kong, most restaurants are quite nice.

211
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,160
 Reputation, though, is not reality.

212
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,440
 What Jesus is saying here is,

213
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,480
 you guys are known for being alive.

214
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,000
 You guys are known for being righteous.

215
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 But I can tell you that is not the reality.

216
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,880
 People think that you're alive, but I know you are dead.

217
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,040
 People see on the outside and think you're doing well,

218
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,000
 but I know on the inside, you are not doing well.

219
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,160
 Now, can you just imagine if you were this,

220
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,280
 if you were in this congregation in Sardis,

221
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,840
 this former royal town, comfortable, no persecution,

222
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,200
 you're doing a decent job, it's a comfortable life,

223
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,640
 but you know that you're not alive.

224
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,880
 You know you're just doing things just for the sake of it.

225
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,600
 You know that's just how you've been doing.

226
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,320
 But then Jesus himself tells you,

227
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,600
 I know you, I see through you.

228
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,240
 Wouldn't that just send shivers down your spine?

229
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,000
 Jesus said this to the people that he saw,

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,080
 Pharisees, Matthew 23, he says,

231
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,520
 you guys are busy cleaning on the outside of your cup,

232
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,200
 but the inside of your cup is dirty.

233
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,880
 I ask that to myself.

234
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,520
 How much do we, do I get engrossed with

235
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,000
 how I present myself to other people?

236
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
 What reputation I have?

237
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,080
 Reputation is so important here, right?

238
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,800
 Especially in a city like Hong Kong.

239
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,400
 And yet Jesus is saying, your reputation is not reality.

240
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,680
 And this is a question that all of us believers

241
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,960
 have to ask ourselves.

242
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,480
 What are we like on the inside?

243
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,720
 Are we people of integrity?

244
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,280
 Where we are the same when we're on our own,

245
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,840
 and we're the same when we are around other people?

246
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,480
 Recognizing that Jesus sees straight through us,

247
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,920
 and us as the church.

248
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,320
 Well, first of all, we have to ask ourselves,

249
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,760
 what kind of reputation do we have?

250
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,960
 Right, it might not even be a good one.

251
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,560
 This church had a good reputation, what about ours?

252
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,720
 Jesus desires for us to be known as people who follow him,

253
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,240
 as people who love one another, who strive for unity.

254
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,920
 Do we have that reputation?

255
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,240
 Before we even think about reality,

256
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
 that's the first thing that we really have to go for.

257
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,280
 And that starts with us as individuals.

258
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,160
 So I ask you, brothers and sisters,

259
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,680
 how are you doing inside?

260
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,280
 On the outside, you guys look great, you really do.

261
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,600
 And you're in church, so therefore reputation.

262
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,080
 We know that you're believers, we know that you love God,

263
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,280
 but what about on the inside?

264
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,640
 What are you like on the inside?

265
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,960
 What am I like on the inside?

266
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,720
 Because it is so dangerous if we look clean on the outside,

267
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,720
 but are dirty on the inside.

268
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,320
 It is dangerous for us as believers to be operating in that

269
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,480
 because it's hypocritical.

270
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,880
 It's dangerous for leaders, for church leaders,

271
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,720
 to be on that.

272
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,040
 And actually, church leaders, recently we've seen,

273
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,240
 we are just humans.

274
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,160
 And if we serve just on empty tanks,

275
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,400
 then we're just as bad as the rest.

276
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,400
 It's important for us to have reality checks

277
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,760
 on where we are at.

278
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,160
 It's also dangerous because it actually causes,

279
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,200
 if we don't do a reality check on ourselves,

280
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
 we are prone to sleepwalking.

281
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,120
 Sleepwalking, does anyone sleepwalk here?

282
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,680
 I used to sleepwalk, I used to sleepwalk,

283
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,880
 especially when I was a kid.

284
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,600
 It's actually quite terrifying sleepwalking, right?

285
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,000
 Well, not for the person who's sleepwalking,

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,120
 it's actually quite leisurely,

287
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,800
 but for the person, people who watch other people sleepwalk.

288
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,600
 So growing up, my brother and I,

289
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,280
 we used to share a room together

290
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,400
 because he was scared of the dark.

291
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,080
 He's still afraid of the dark right now.

292
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
 So we had to share a room.

293
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,080
 And there was one evening, my mum and dad saw me get up

294
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,240
 and run around the house looking for my brother.

295
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,640
 And of course, in England, we have houses

296
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,680
 so we can actually run around.

297
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,280
 You can't really run around in Hong Kong apartments.

298
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,480
 So I was running around up and down the stairs,

299
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,120
 up and down the stairs, shouting, "Hey man, hey man."

300
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,240
 That's a Chinese name, He-Man.

301
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,360
 "Hey man, hey man."

302
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,920
 And then my mum, having known that this had happened,

303
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,400
 we were prone to this, she would let me be,

304
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,640
 'cause apparently you're supposed to let people be, right?

305
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,200
 Let them carry on sleepwalking.

306
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,760
 So she'd try and gently prod me back to go into bed.

307
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,160
 But I'd keep running around the house.

308
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,120
 And I can imagine this being really scary.

309
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,760
 Another friend of mine sleepwalked as well.

310
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,200
 I mean, we should have got together.

311
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,280
 It would have been fun.

312
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,000
 But he did something a lot more devastating.

313
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,040
 He walked into his parents' room

314
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,040
 and then stood by his mum's bed, thought it was a toilet.

315
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,040
 (audience laughing)

316
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,960
 And then relieved himself and then went back to bed.

317
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,120
 And so the mum's face would go, "What are you doing?"

318
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,960
 (screaming)

319
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,360
 (audience laughing)

320
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,640
 Amazing, but anyway, I didn't do that.

321
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,560
 I was just running around like a madman.

322
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,640
 Of course, my brother was just in my room

323
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,920
 and he was right next to me,

324
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,440
 but I was just running around looking for him.

325
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,640
 But I wonder how many of us

326
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,240
 actually are spiritually sleepwalking.

327
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,440
 How many of us are running around in life

328
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,480
 looking for something?

329
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,840
 We know there's something inside us that is empty.

330
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,080
 We know that we should be filling it with something,

331
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,880
 but we're just running around looking for it

332
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,440
 when all along it's been Jesus.

333
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,280
 When all along he's been right there,

334
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,840
 but we are spiritually asleep.

335
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,440
 We are sleepwalking.

336
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,440
 Are you spiritually asleep?

337
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,760
 Are you sleepwalking?

338
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,280
 Have you been in the faith for that long

339
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,320
 that actually you just don't remember when it first began?

340
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,840
 And actually you don't really care where it's going.

341
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,960
 You kind of know where it's going.

342
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,400
 You know you're supposed to be going to heaven

343
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,360
 at some point, but now you're just kind of wandering.

344
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,920
 Spiritually sleepwalking.

345
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
 That's a dangerous place to be in.

346
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,760
 That's a useless place to be in.

347
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,320
 You see, the church of Sardis didn't deviate

348
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,600
 from sound teaching, but it was sound asleep.

349
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,240
 And Jesus is saying, "Wake up."

350
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,880
 Sorry, some of you, I've actually just woken you up.

351
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,240
 Wake, hi, I'm still here, sorry.

352
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,080
 Wake up.

353
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,600
 You are spiritually asleep.

354
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,880
 Wake up.

355
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,920
 You see, this church didn't have any false heresies.

356
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,120
 But in some ways, actually a lot of commentators said

357
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,840
 that actually this church was content with being mediocre.

358
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,880
 In fact, to actually even have false heresies

359
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,000
 at least assumes that you had an enthusiasm for truth,

360
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,400
 that you were eager to learn something.

361
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,440
 You were just being misled.

362
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,560
 This church didn't even have that, so they didn't even care.

363
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,320
 So they didn't even have the enthusiasm

364
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,360
 to entertain heresies.

365
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,640
 Another thing is, they also didn't have any persecution.

366
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,280
 Why? Because their convictions weren't deep enough

367
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,000
 to be intolerant to the people outside.

368
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,880
 So therefore, the people outside are like,

369
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,520
 "There's no point in persecuting that group.

370
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,480
 "They are just a cozy, easy, lazy bunch of believers

371
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
 "that basically make no impact in the world.

372
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,520
 "Leave them alone."

373
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,480
 So this church was not in a good place.

374
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,200
 It was spiritually asleep,

375
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,240
 which is akin to being spiritually dead.

376
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,640
 And that's why Jesus says, "Wake up."

377
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,040
 Wake up.

378
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,520
 It goes, verse two, "Wake up and strengthen what remains

379
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,280
 "and is about to die, for I have not found your works

380
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,520
 "complete in the sight of my God."

381
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,320
 You see, I preached a couple of weeks ago

382
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,960
 on the church of Ephesus that had lacked,

383
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,520
 that had abandoned the first love.

384
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,480
 And Christina and I, we were in a Bible study today

385
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,600
 talking about amongst believers

386
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,320
 who'd believed for a long time,

387
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,480
 just talking about our first love,

388
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,640
 that they'd abandoned the first love.

389
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,840
 So the church of Ephesus lacked love.

390
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,200
 The church of Sardis lacked life.

391
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,880
 Both are crucial.

392
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,400
 The church of Ephesus had the head knowledge,

393
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,240
 but it had failed, it had stopped,

394
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,240
 and didn't let it drop down into the heart.

395
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,360
 The church of Sardis barely had the head knowledge, kind of,

396
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,760
 but didn't let it go into the heart

397
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,240
 and also didn't let it go into the limbs.

398
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,040
 It didn't spur them to action.

399
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,920
 So they were dead.

400
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,480
 And Jesus is saying, "Wake up, wake up."

401
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,280
 This week, there was some big news

402
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,760
 that I believe really affected the financial markets.

403
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,520
 There was a company that announced

404
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,400
 that they had found the vaccine.

405
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,720
 Pfizer announced that the vaccine is on its way,

406
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,600
 was fast-tracked, and it's 90% accurate, is that so?

407
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,920
 Let me know how it goes if anyone takes it.

408
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,600
 (audience laughing)

409
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,520
 As a biology teacher, I was thinking about,

410
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
 I mean, 'cause we've been talking about vaccines

411
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,080
 for a long time, feels like we won't be able to fly,

412
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,440
 truly, until we have this vaccine.

413
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,400
 But how do vaccinations work?

414
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,280
 Vaccinations work by injecting a weak or a dead version

415
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,760
 of said virus into your body,

416
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,480
 so that then your body,

417
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,520
 because it's only a weak or dead version,

418
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,840
 learns to tolerate it, learns to battle it,

419
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,120
 and learns to kill it, and it has the memory cells

420
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,080
 so then in the future, it'll have the antibodies,

421
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,200
 so when you do get exposed to the real thing,

422
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,920
 it now knows how to tackle it.

423
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,480
 That's how a vaccination works.

424
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,760
 Then I started to think,

425
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,400
 I wonder how many of us have injected ourselves

426
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,560
 with a weak or dead version of Christianity

427
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,960
 that stops us from experiencing the real thing.

428
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,560
 How many of us think that we have Christianity,

429
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,600
 but it's actually just a weak or dead version?

430
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
 Now, the problem with just having this weak or dead version

431
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,200
 is you cannot upgrade.

432
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,640
 You cannot just say, "Oh, I'm gonna move from,"

433
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,240
 or you can, but not naturally from this path.

434
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,040
 You have to get rid of the fake or the weak

435
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,800
 or the dead version of Christianity

436
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,520
 before you can truly experience the whole of it.

437
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,000
 But how many of us here are blocked

438
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,960
 because we have a weak or dead version of the faith?

439
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,880
 That's a question that only you can ask yourself,

440
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,640
 and that's a question that only you can get answers from

441
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,960
 between you and God.

442
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,680
 How many of us are spiritually dead,

443
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,360
 spiritually sleepwalking?

444
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,520
 Jesus is telling us,

445
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,240
 it doesn't matter what people think about you,

446
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,440
 whether people think you're still a Christian,

447
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,880
 whether people still think you're a leader,

448
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,560
 what matters is that I know

449
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,840
 that your reputation is not reality.

450
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,040
 So wake up, oh sleeper, rise from the dead,

451
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,840
 and Christ will shine on you.

452
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,760
 That is what Paul says to the church in Ephesus.

453
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,280
 Clearly, it's a problem.

454
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,960
 That is the first one, reputation is not reality.

455
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,560
 And then it carries on at the end and it says,

456
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,400
 oh, these key words here before I move on.

457
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,080
 For I have not found your works complete

458
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,520
 in the sight of my God.

459
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,600
 I have not found your works complete.

460
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,360
 When we see the word complete,

461
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,560
 whether it's downloading something on the computer

462
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,640
 or uploading or doing whatever, any kind of process,

463
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,280
 the word complete tells us whatever we wanted it to do,

464
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,640
 it is now done.

465
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,960
 It has fulfilled its purpose.

466
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,520
 But Jesus is looking at this church inside

467
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,600
 and saying, you guys are doing lots of works,

468
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,000
 but God is saying that your works are not complete.

469
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,520
 You are not doing what you're supposed to do.

470
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,880
 You are sleepwalking, you are running around in circles,

471
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,760
 looking for something, but you'll never find it

472
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,320
 because you're sleepwalking.

473
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,600
 So wake up, reputation is not reality.

474
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,680
 Number two, remember what you have received.

475
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,400
 Verse three, remember then what you received

476
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,680
 and heard, keep it and repent.

477
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,520
 Remember what you received.

478
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,480
 This is the same message as the church in Ephesus.

479
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,040
 Remember how you got here.

480
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,400
 Remember how you got into this church.

481
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,120
 Remember your first love,

482
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,240
 why you are even here in the first place.

483
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,880
 Remember that because what is the biggest problem

484
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,080
 in humanity, in us humans?

485
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,920
 Forgetfulness.

486
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,800
 Because forgetfulness leads to ungratefulness.

487
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,720
 Ungratefulness leads to ungodliness.

488
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,680
 Because for us, if we forget how far away we were,

489
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,440
 how blind we were, how broken we were,

490
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,440
 then we won't truly understand how much love

491
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,040
 he extends to us.

492
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,120
 And we see this as we look in scripture all the time.

493
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,760
 As we look in the Old Testament,

494
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,640
 we see the Israelites time and time and time again,

495
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,400
 forgetting, forgetting, forgetting.

496
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,240
 They learn a little bit, they burn themselves,

497
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,680
 they remember, and then they forget.

498
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,080
 And then they're just trapped in these vicious cycles

499
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,200
 of forgetfulness.

500
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,920
 So Jesus is saying, remember what you heard.

501
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,680
 Remember what you received.

502
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,360
 That's why anniversaries are so important.

503
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,160
 That's why communion is so important for us as a body.

504
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,360
 We're saying, together, Christ, we remember what you did.

505
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,720
 We need each other to remember what Jesus did for us.

506
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,360
 Remember what you have received.

507
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,080
 That you are not sat here

508
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,880
 because you did something great yourself.

509
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,240
 God did not choose to love you

510
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,840
 because he thought that you were

511
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,520
 particularly worthy of his love.

512
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,120
 Everything that we have is because we received it

513
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,920
 through grace as a gift, and it was free.

514
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,280
 And Jesus is saying, remember what you received.

515
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,160
 That is incredibly important if we are then

516
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,840
 to do the next thing, which is repent.

517
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,440
 Time and time again in these letters,

518
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,080
 Jesus says, repent.

519
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,960
 Not just change your mindset,

520
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,400
 not just make a few amendments.

521
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,440
 Jesus is saying, do a U-turn,

522
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,640
 turn from your old ways and repent.

523
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,480
 Or what?

524
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,280
 Repent or be removed.

525
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,560
 Jesus in these letters is pretty harsh

526
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,360
 because each time he will just say, you repent,

527
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,200
 or in this one here in verse three,

528
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,200
 repent if you will not wake up, I will come like a thief

529
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,120
 and you will not know at what hour I will come.

530
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,520
 The first letter, Jesus says he'll remove that church

531
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,680
 from the lampstand, shut them down.

532
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,520
 Here he says, I will come like a thief

533
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,680
 and you won't even know it hit you.

534
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,320
 This isn't the second coming though, by the way.

535
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,520
 This isn't Jesus saying, I'm gonna come again

536
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,440
 because by that one, it doesn't matter

537
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,760
 whether we're awake or asleep.

538
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,400
 Jesus is coming and we have no choice in the matter.

539
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,360
 But this one, Jesus is saying, if you don't wake up,

540
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,360
 if you continue sleepwalking, I will shut you down.

541
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,000
 Jesus is reminding this church,

542
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,320
 church, you are the lampstand, but you're not the light.

543
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,120
 I'm the light of the world.

544
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,200
 The role of the church is to lift up the light.

545
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,360
 But if the lampstand isn't doing its job,

546
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,440
 Jesus is saying, I will remove that lampstand,

547
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,960
 I will shut you down.

548
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,720
 See, it sounds harsh, but you know,

549
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,320
 Jesus is giving this church

550
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,720
 and he's giving us a wake up call.

551
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,760
 He's giving us a wake up call

552
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,880
 because we are sleeping, but in his grace

553
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,320
 and in his patience, he isn't shutting us down just yet.

554
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,040
 And he's giving us a wake up call.

555
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,920
 Now, 2020 has been the most terrible of years

556
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,600
 for most people, but from a spiritual sense,

557
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,440
 I am grateful for it because it provides us with what?

558
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,480
 A wake up call.

559
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,960
 Have you received the wake up call from this year,

560
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,440
 from 2020, as God removes all the comforts

561
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,000
 and all the things and all the routines

562
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,080
 that you had put in place to keep your life comfortable?

563
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,160
 Have you heeded his wake up call?

564
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,920
 This wake up call is super important.

565
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,560
 Actually, it's wake up calls that defined each moment

566
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,760
 in my life.

567
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,920
 At 17, when my father passed away, boom, wake up call.

568
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,280
 What are you doing here, James?

569
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,320
 What are you living for?

570
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,040
 At 23, I was in hospital for a month

571
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,880
 without eating anything.

572
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,640
 I came out incredibly skinny,

573
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,040
 just completely malnourished.

574
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,720
 But I remember during that month

575
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,760
 that I was in the hospital,

576
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,800
 I was never closer to God in that time then.

577
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,000
 Why?

578
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,840
 Because he was giving me a wake up call.

579
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,520
 The things that you think that you are aiming for in life

580
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,160
 at that point, God's saying,

581
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,520
 "I could take it away just like that."

582
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,400
 But in my wisdom, in my love,

583
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
 I'm allowing you to continue to live.

584
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,960
 So carry out your purpose.

585
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,120
 Your work is not complete yet.

586
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,280
 My next wake up call when I was 25, 'cause I got married.

587
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,080
 That's a big wake up call, isn't it?

588
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,600
 27, when I have my first child.

589
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,000
 29, when I have my second one.

590
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And then I'm in hospital again for another month.

591
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,320
 It's as if I don't learn.

592
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,760
 Because I'm forgetful.

593
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,080
 Are you forgetful?

594
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
 Those moments in your life

595
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,520
 where you're super close to God,

596
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,280
 where you start doing the spiritual disciplines,

597
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,320
 where you're doing all these things,

598
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,160
 and then slowly but surely, it just dwindles and forgets.

599
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,080
 And Jesus says, "Wake up,

600
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,160
 "because I could come like a thief."

601
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:47,880
 And I want you to wake up, repent, or be removed.

602
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,760
 Sardis, this church in Sardis would have known

603
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,160
 about this wake up call.

604
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,840
 I mentioned that it was invaded a couple times.

605
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,680
 In 500 BC and in 200 BC, it was invaded by enemy nations.

606
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,520
 How?

607
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,080
 In the most peculiar way.

608
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,880
 The enemy wanted to capture the city, the citadel.

609
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,280
 And so it planned and strategized.

610
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,760
 And at nighttime, they crept up to the citadel,

611
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,720
 and they realized the door was open.

612
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,640
 And so they just walked in and took over the city

613
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,320
 while all its residents were sleeping.

614
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,160
 This royal town that was relying on its reputation

615
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,480
 from the past was complacent.

616
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,040
 And that was 500 BC.

617
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,720
 And you'd have thought they'd learned.

618
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,320
 But just a few hundred years later,

619
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,960
 the same thing happened again.

620
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,000
 A group of 10 to 12 people went in, crept in,

621
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,720
 and the door was open again.

622
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,000
 And this city that was comfortable

623
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,160
 but complacent was captured.

624
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,120
 They were sleepwalking.

625
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,800
 So Jesus, knowing that context, was telling them,

626
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,360
 you've been here before.

627
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,400
 This is not a drill.

628
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,160
 You know that this kind of stuff can happen.

629
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,200
 In fact, in 17 AD, it does happen,

630
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,040
 but in a different way.

631
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,080
 They had an earthquake, which completely you can't control,

632
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,840
 which decimated the whole town.

633
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,000
 So they know things can happen.

634
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 2020, fast forward to today,

635
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,480
 we know that things can happen.

636
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,840
 We know that the plans that we make

637
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,040
 may not actually happen.

638
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,760
 Proverbs 16, nine, that as we plan our steps,

639
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,920
 it is God who determines.

640
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,840
 It is God who establishes them.

641
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,320
 The book of James talks about this.

642
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,760
 Let's not say where we're gonna go tomorrow

643
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,440
 as though we're in complete control.

644
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,280
 We are not.

645
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,400
 We are but vapors in the wind.

646
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,320
 We could just disappear just like that.

647
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,640
 But that's not to say that we live in fear all the time.

648
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,600
 I had that.

649
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,720
 Actually, after my dad died suddenly,

650
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,280
 I had that fear all the time.

651
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,960
 Any moment, we could go.

652
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,800
 That's it.

653
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,920
 Any moment, we could go.

654
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,440
 Like, you could go, I could go.

655
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,280
 Everyone's gonna die.

656
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,560
 I had that mindset.

657
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,760
 That's not to say that we need to hold that mindset

658
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,040
 because we also believe in a good God

659
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,720
 who is in complete control,

660
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,120
 that nothing happens without him saying yes.

661
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,360
 What he does want us to do is to continue living today

662
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,040
 as though eternity is coming.

663
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,960
 And that is our role,

664
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,920
 to point the people of this world

665
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,800
 into the kingdom of heaven,

666
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,880
 to point them and turn their eyes to Jesus.

667
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,360
 That is why we exist.

668
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,920
 That is why we live and breathe.

669
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,160
 And if we don't do that,

670
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,960
 if we don't repent from following the old ways of the world,

671
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,080
 if we continue to conform to the passes of this world,

672
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,120
 Jesus is saying to his church, to us,

673
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,640
 you could be removed.

674
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,400
 So for us, it requires us to do a reality check,

675
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,480
 to do an audit of our own lives.

676
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,320
 Jesus says this,

677
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,280
 "Wake up and strengthen what remains,"

678
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,080
 'cause he knows that there is something there.

679
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,640
 Just like I'm looking at you thinking

680
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,000
 there is something there inside you

681
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,640
 that if it can be activated,

682
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,720
 the body of Christ would be better for it.

683
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,040
 God would be glorified in a better way.

684
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,680
 Many of you know that Christine and I,

685
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,360
 we transitioned into another role.

686
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,520
 We've been working with an organization called Young Life

687
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,360
 that goes into schools and universities

688
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,240
 to spread the gospel, to reach the unreached,

689
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,360
 to present them with the good news,

690
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,960
 because it is news to them.

691
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,200
 And that is our main mission, and that's what we do.

692
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,880
 But there's another group that really is on our hearts.

693
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,520
 It's preaching and sharing the good news

694
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,120
 to those within the church.

695
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,800
 Because we recognize the church,

696
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,560
 the church, the bride of Christ,

697
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,120
 we're not in a necessarily healthy state,

698
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,040
 but we are sleeping, we are sleepwalking.

699
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,520
 We have a reputation for being alive,

700
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,720
 but we're actually dead.

701
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,640
 And so the onus is on all of us as individuals

702
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,360
 to do checks on ourselves.

703
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,800
 Are we walking with God?

704
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,080
 Are we committed to completing works

705
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,120
 that are complete in the sight of God?

706
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,520
 So it's been pretty bad all the way until now,

707
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,000
 but there is a final nice point,

708
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,680
 and the fourth point is this.

709
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,840
 Reward awaits the resilient.

710
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,600
 And it says this, verse four.

711
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,720
 Yet you have still a few names in Silas,

712
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,000
 people who have not soiled their garments,

713
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,640
 and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.

714
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,200
 The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments,

715
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,240
 and I will never blot out his name out of the book of life.

716
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,960
 I will confess his name before my father

717
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,080
 and before his angels.

718
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,920
 That's the only bit of positive thing that is going on here.

719
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,200
 There are some of you, a few of you in this city

720
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,800
 have not soiled your garments.

721
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,520
 It's like a Chinese parent praising their kid.

722
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,280
 He's like, I can't say that you're good

723
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,840
 because there's something about me, I can't say it,

724
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,520
 but all I'll say is, not bad.

725
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,280
 That's all I can say.

726
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,360
 You're not bad, (speaks in foreign language)

727
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,040
 that's all I can get out.

728
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,800
 And in this church, almost Jesus is saying that,

729
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,000
 there's not that much good I can see,

730
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,760
 but all I'll say is, there's a few of you.

731
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,520
 There's a few of you who haven't messed this up.

732
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,080
 Now it's interesting because the other letters

733
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,280
 is often the majority are doing quite well.

734
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,880
 You've kept to the good teaching,

735
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,360
 you're doing your good works,

736
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,280
 but there's a few of you who have strayed away.

737
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,200
 This time it's flipped.

738
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,200
 The majority are asleep, but the minority are awake.

739
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,760
 And I think that's this kind of place

740
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,080
 that we find ourselves in right now here in Hong Kong.

741
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,160
 Do you recognize, do you know that we as believers here

742
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,320
 are the minority in this city?

743
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,160
 What's the percentage, John?

744
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,160
 I think it's 5% of Hong Kong are believers, 5%.

745
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:57,320
 Doesn't that break your heart?

746
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,880
 That there are people outside

747
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,440
 who do not know what they were made for?

748
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,560
 There are people wandering the streets,

749
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,400
 toiling, working super hard,

750
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,320
 but they don't know what they're doing it for.

751
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,320
 Doesn't that put more onus on us as the 5%

752
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,440
 to live out our faith,

753
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,560
 to not be sleepwalking at the very least?

754
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,440
 Because there is a whole majority out there

755
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,520
 that do not know God.

756
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:39,680
 Yet a few of you remain who have not sold your garments.

757
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,640
 And here Jesus gives the final encouragement.

758
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,200
 The reward awaits the resilient,

759
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,680
 even though you are minority.

760
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,280
 And I'm looking at you brothers and sisters,

761
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,960
 and I know that you are minority in your family.

762
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,200
 I know that you are the minority in your workplace

763
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,040
 or in your universities or in your schools.

764
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,920
 I know that you feel as though you are the minority

765
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,680
 and Jesus is here, is encouraging you.

766
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,040
 Say, you may be the only believer in your family.

767
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,480
 You may be the only Christian

768
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,800
 that's trying to uphold godly values in your workplace.

769
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,320
 And He's saying, remain resilient.

770
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,760
 Hold on, I see you.

771
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,440
 I know you're there, I know what you're doing.

772
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,080
 Keep fighting the good fight, keep running the race,

773
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,240
 because there is a reward that awaits you

774
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,960
 if you are resilient.

775
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,480
 I think there's someone in this room tonight

776
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,960
 who needs to hear that even though you are the minority,

777
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,960
 that God is gonna use you massively.

778
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,600
 Just like a little bit of salt can change

779
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,640
 how a whole piece of steak tastes.

780
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,320
 Just like how a little bit of a light in a room

781
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,480
 can completely change a dark room.

782
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,320
 You, brothers and sisters, are called

783
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,680
 to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.

784
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,480
 And you may be a minority, but the encouragement is this,

785
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,720
 there is a reward that awaits you.

786
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,600
 So keep running that race, keep fighting the good fight.

787
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,640
 And what will you get in return?

788
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:16,680
 You'll get to walk with me in white, for you are worthy.

789
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,920
 The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments

790
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,240
 and I will never blot out his name.

791
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,200
 You get to walk with him.

792
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,480
 This is Jesus' promise and encouragement to you,

793
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,040
 that you will be able to walk with him in white.

794
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,880
 Why white?

795
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,040
 What's the whole point of that?

796
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
 It's just like a wedding dress,

797
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,680
 it's like a bride standing before her groom

798
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,000
 in a white wedding dress.

799
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,240
 It's a sign of purity,

800
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,360
 it's a sign of righteousness and holiness.

801
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,040
 And Jesus is saying, if you don't soil your own garments,

802
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,720
 I will clothe you in white.

803
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,120
 You will be presented to God as blameless.

804
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,440
 Your name will be written down in the book of life

805
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,360
 and it will never be blotted out.

806
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,640
 Which is probably an important message to the church,

807
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,120
 to the people of Sardis,

808
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,920
 who probably because of all the captures

809
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,160
 had different royal names being blotted out,

810
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,160
 but he is saying, I will never blot out your name

811
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,280
 and you will be clothed in white with me.

812
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,280
 So remain resilient, remain resilient, wake up.

813
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Remember what you received and heard, keep it, repent,

814
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,120
 turn away and you will get a reward.

815
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,080
 And here is the key word.

816
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,440
 Jesus says, you will walk with me.

817
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,520
 Even if you're the minority, you will walk with me.

818
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,120
 I am the one doing great things,

819
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,960
 I am the one making all things new,

820
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,400
 you just have to walk with me.

821
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,560
 But you see, there's a problem.

822
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,480
 Sometimes when we are the minority,

823
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,040
 not only do we get weary

824
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,080
 and just completely go back into our own shell,

825
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,280
 the other thing is we just think we're gonna fight

826
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,080
 and win souls for Jesus.

827
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,640
 And we're gonna do everything for him.

828
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,000
 Jesus, you stay back there,

829
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,040
 I am gonna go and fight this battle

830
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,680
 and do what I can for you.

831
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,680
 Jesus is saying, no, walk with me, don't do things for me.

832
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,800
 Jesus is calling them not out to action necessarily,

833
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,240
 Jesus is calling them in to his presence.

834
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,760
 Because that's the only way that we will stay awake.

835
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,720
 Not the maybe the new term now of being woke,

836
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,640
 that is different.

837
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,000
 Not completely different,

838
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,560
 but this idea of just being aware

839
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,040
 that Jesus is in your life

840
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,000
 and that he may call you to speak

841
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,880
 into racial, economical, political issues.

842
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,440
 But the key isn't those things,

843
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,680
 the key is being close to him, to walking with him.

844
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,280
 Because if you walk with him,

845
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,000
 you will be clothed in white,

846
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 you will be righteous, you will be blameless.

847
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,320
 So my encouragement to you is if you are a minority

848
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,600
 or if you are struggling to hold on,

849
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,800
 Jesus sees you, Jesus sees you,

850
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,520
 so keep on that path, keep going.

851
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,640
 For those of you who are sleepwalking,

852
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,240
 I'm saying, wake up, wake up.

853
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,440
 Because Jesus is calling you into his presence

854
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
 and calling you into action.

855
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,960
 There is no time and no space

856
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,840
 where we can be spiritually asleep,

857
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,920
 especially at such a time as this.

858
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,880
 And the final verse that we keep seeing

859
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,920
 over and over again, verse six,

860
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,480
 "He who has an ear, let him hear

861
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,800
 "what the Spirit says to the churches."

862
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,480
 He who has an ear, everyone here has an ear.

863
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,040
 So Jesus is speaking to all of us here.

864
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,360
 But why do we have to trust him?

865
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,720
 Why do you have to commit to following him

866
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,200
 and hearing these words?

867
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,800
 Because he can be trusted.

868
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,280
 He says here, "The one who conquers

869
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,480
 "will be clothed thus in white garments."

870
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,240
 We can trust him because he conquered,

871
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,720
 because he was the one that conquered death,

872
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,360
 because he was thought to be dead,

873
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,440
 but is now alive.

874
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,720
 He had a reputation for being a rebel,

875
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,320
 for not submitting to authorities,

876
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,440
 for threatening to overthrow the Roman Empire.

877
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,800
 But instead, the reality was he submitted himself,

878
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,040
 sacrificed himself, and ended up ushering in

879
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,040
 a completely new kingdom that was not of this world,

880
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,440
 that outlived the Roman Empire.

881
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,640
 That is why we can trust him.

882
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,000
 That is why we need to take heed of what he says.

883
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,080
 We need to remember what he did for us.

884
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,920
 And then we need to repent and choose to follow him.

885
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,440
 And we know that there will be a reward.

886
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,280
 Why?

887
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,080
 Because of what he did for us.

888
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,960
 See, our works were incomplete,

889
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,600
 but Jesus, he came to this earth,

890
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,720
 and he finished it by declaring three words.

891
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,280
 It is finished.

892
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,520
 And by carrying out his purpose,

893
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,200
 his work was complete, and we, he had one job.

894
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,960
 We had one job to do, and that was to save all of us.

895
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,840
 And he did it via the cross.

896
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,320
 And he got his Father in heaven,

897
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,000
 opened up the heavens and declared,

898
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,400
 "This is my Son, with whom I am well pleased."

899
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,720
 The words every Chinese child yearns to hear

900
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,760
 from their parents.

901
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,120
 Because his works were complete.

902
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,080
 And his reward was now that his name is above every name.

903
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,200
 That even though he shed his blood,

904
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,840
 that he wore the crown of thorns,

905
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,360
 he now has white garments and robes.

906
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:53,360
 And the key is that he now offers those garments to you.

907
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,400
 That he is saying,

908
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,280
 "It doesn't matter what you've done in the past.

909
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,400
 "I've dealt with it.

910
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,240
 "It is gone.

911
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,040
 "It is complete."

912
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,840
 It doesn't matter how sleepy you've been in your life.

913
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,840
 He has the power to speak life into you.

914
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,680
 It doesn't matter if you feel as though your life

915
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,240
 is just a valley of dry bones.

916
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,520
 Scripture tells us that the Spirit of God, Jesus himself,

917
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,200
 has the power to speak life into you.

918
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,240
 And that is my encouragement to you today.

919
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:28,240
 Church of Hong Kong, Church of Kung Fu, wake up.

920
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,720
 Arise, O sleeper.

921
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,720
 Rise from the dead and Christ will shine on you.

922
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:44,160
 And we all know that there is a 95% majority out there

923
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:52,000
 that their souls depend on us waking up

924
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,360
 and sharing that good news with them.

925
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,840
 Brothers, sisters, are you awake?

926
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,000
 Let's pray.

927
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:19,560
 Jesus, we come before you and we hear this wake up call.

928
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,640
 We know that you see every aspect of our lives.

929
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,680
 You know that we are prone to sleepwalking.

930
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:34,280
 We are prone to chasing for things, meaningless pursuits.

931
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:41,960
 Or you know our inactive state.

932
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,800
 And we come before you and we repent.

933
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,120
 We remember that you did not call us to a life

934
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,800
 of just comfort, of complacency.

935
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:58,080
 But that you've called us to be active parts of your body.

936
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:04,560
 So we pray that your spirit will strengthen what remains

937
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,720
 and is about to die.

938
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,920
 Lord, I know that there are people in this room

939
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,880
 who are clinging on for dear life

940
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,440
 in their own spiritual lives.

941
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,280
 And I pray, Lord, that your spirit will strengthen

942
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,880
 what remains, that you will help them rise up again,

943
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,240
 Lord, that you will shine on them.

944
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,080
 That you will remind them that this is a gift

945
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,240
 that they can receive.

946
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,120
 There is nothing that they need to do

947
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,200
 other than open their arms to you.

948
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,640
 Lord, because you were the one that conquered death.

949
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,640
 And Lord, because of your grace,

950
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,880
 you shared our victory with us.

951
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,680
 You were the one that was dead, but was then alive.

952
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,520
 And because of that, we who are dead can also now be alive.

953
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,240
 (gentle music)

954
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,760
 So we declare together as one body,

955
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,360
 albeit the minority in this city.

956
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,400
 We declare with everything that we have

957
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,400
 that Jesus, you are alive.

958
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,000
 And that we rejoice.

959
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,920
 And we allow that fact head from our heads into our hearts

960
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,560
 and then spur us into action in our hands and feet.

961
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:34,000
 We as a body desire to be woken up

962
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,040
 and to follow you.

963
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,480
 And it's in your precious name we pray, amen.

964
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,980
 (piano music)
