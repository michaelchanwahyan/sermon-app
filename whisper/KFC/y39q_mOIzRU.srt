1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 All right, good evening everybody.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Good to see you here, some of you.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And it is difficult times, I understand.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Thank you for making the effort to come and worship with us.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 And for those online, thank you for making the effort to join us.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 And we welcome you to this family of worship together.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 So we've been going through the book of James, not the book of James, the book of Matthew.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I was thinking about Matthew and then I saw Jesus is King and I just like came up with James for some reason.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I don't know why.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 But Jesus is King in the book of Matthew and we've been going through this book.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 And it's been our third week now.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And we went through firstly the King's record and John brought us through that.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Looking at the genealogy, how Jesus came to be, the story.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 And then we also talked about the King's rise and Pastor James talked about the approval of Jesus Christ.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Being assessed and then assembled.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 How he was approved at baptism.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And then now today we're going to talk about the King's regulations.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And so I have this picture up here.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 It's of Jose Mourinho.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And it's a connection between me and John because we've passed one manager to the other team.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And they might not be that happy because of it.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 But when a new manager or a new coach comes in, what usually happens is that there's a new way of doing things.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 There's a new style of play.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 The coach runs things differently.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And we see that when Jesus comes into power, when he comes and he was approved, assessed, and assembled,

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 he comes in with his own regulations as well.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 His own way of doing things.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And we're going to look at five aspects today of the King's regulations.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And it's from chapter 5 to chapter 7.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 We're going to go through the character of the King's people, the calling of the King's people,

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 the new covenant of the King, the conduct of the King's people, and the new clarity of the King's people.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And so we're going to go through firstly the sermon, the Beatitudes that are from the Sermon on the Mount.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 And now the Sermon on the Mount is one of the most famous sermons from Jesus.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And I don't think I can do it justice with 30 minutes about how much content is in there.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 But I'm going to give you an overview of what Jesus is talking about and what he is confirming in his regulations through that sermon.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And so read with me.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Matthew chapter 5, "Blessed," 1, 2, 3.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth."

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 So firstly, we're going to talk about the new character of the King's people.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 New character of the King's people.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Now, Pastor James went through the Beatitudes during the Chinese New Year.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 He did a great job of comparing the East and the West and how Christianity makes a difference in that.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And if you want to look more deeply into that, please go into his sermon.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I'm going to give you more of an overview of what is going on.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 So firstly, we see that the new character of the King's people, their attitude towards themselves is that they're growing in their dependence on God.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 "Blessed are the poor in spirit."

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 It doesn't mean that they're financially poor.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 It means that they see the poverty of their own spirituality.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 They need God more and more.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 They're growing in their dependence on God.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And there's a promise, right?

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 With each blessing comes a promise that theirs is the kingdom of God.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 "Blessed are those who mourn," right?

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Especially those who mourn over their sinful nature.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Mourning over persecution that comes because of their faith.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 "Blessed are those who are meek."

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Meekness is not weakness.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Meekness is honor, self-control, standing for upright and goodness.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So firstly, there's a new character.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And the new character towards themselves is that greater dependence on God.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 They see their own spiritual need.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And secondly, there's also an attitude towards God.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And it says, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness."

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Hunger and thirst for righteousness.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Their attitude towards God is that they're growing in their desire, their passion towards God.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 When's the last time you felt really hungry?

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 When's the last time you felt really thirsty?

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Could you imagine that?

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 That feeling that you had?

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Do you have that same feeling?

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Passion, hunger, thirst for God.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 That is the new character of the king's people.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 That they hunger and thirst for God, for righteousness.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And lastly, there is a new attitude towards others.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 They're seeking mercy and joy within the company of others, rather than conflict.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 They're seeking joy.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 They have joy in the face of persecution.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 So the new character of the king's people, they see their spiritual poverty.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 They have more and more dependence on God.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 They hunger and thirst for Him.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 They have a passion for the Lord.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And they're seeking peace with other people around them.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 There's a new character within the king's people.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 I remember one of my students from the University of Toronto, when I first met him,

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 he's a student from Congo, and his name was Nathan.

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And when I first met him, he was very passionate towards studying.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 He wanted to be rich.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 He wanted to have status, to have that good job.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Because he was brought up in that.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 His dad had a good job, and was bringing up the family to have those same sort of values.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 But as I got to know him more and more, and as he joined our group on campus,

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 he started to become more and more aware of his own sins.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 His own need for God in his life.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Instead of just devoting all of his time to studying, not that studying is bad, right?

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Please study, for those who are studying online, please continue studying.

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 What he did was he trusted the Lord.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 He stepped out in faith, and he made time to learn more about God's Word.

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 To hunger and thirst for God.

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And as he hungered and thirst for God, he started to share God with other people.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I saw a transformation of his character.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 He became more and more of what Jesus was talking about here, and the Beatitudes.

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And so the first thing we see is that there is a change in the King's people.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 The King's people and their character.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Secondly, we're going to look at the calling of the King's people.

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 The calling of the King's people.

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Read with me here.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 You are the salt. One, two, three.

110
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be salty again?

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 So firstly, we see that God, Jesus Christ, is saying that you are the salt of the earth.

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Right? And what is salt used for nowadays?

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Right? For flavor, right?

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Your steak doesn't taste as interesting if you don't have salt in it, right?

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 It's also used back then as a preservative.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 There are many different uses of salt.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 But Jesus highlights something here, that if salt loses its saltiness, what is it good for?

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Nothing.

120
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And nowadays, we take that for granted, right?

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 We have salt in the grocery store, right?

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And we wouldn't expect salt to have no saltiness, right?

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 But back then, different minerals were mixed with the salt, and sometimes when that happened, it would lose its saltiness.

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And it would become useless.

125
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And so what Jesus is saying here, that those who are following him, those who are following the king,

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 must preserve the saltiness, must preserve the character that comes with following Christ.

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 We're called to be in this world, to be engaged in this world, but we're not of this world.

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And so we need to be preservatives.

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 We need to persevere in our following of Jesus Christ.

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And next, he also says that you are the light of the world, right?

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 And the light is not covered.

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 You wouldn't turn on the lights and then put covers over it, right?

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 That would be useless. Just turn off the lights, right?

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 And Jesus is saying that the new character, the new calling of the king's people, is that they are to be light.

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 They are to be distinctive.

136
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 They are to shine forth, right?

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 A light exposes the darkness.

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 You know, light, UV, cleanses.

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Water.

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Light comes life.

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 With light comes life.

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Jesus is calling us to be light, to shine forth, to be distinctive, to be of this world, to be in this world, but not to be of this world.

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And I remember just a couple, you know, just last week we were playing basketball and we met one of these non-Christian friends and we had a chance to have dinner with them afterwards.

144
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And it was actually me and Gabe.

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And we had dinner with them afterwards and he was asking us, "You know, you guys are kind of different."

146
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 You know, you guys work, well, Gabe works in finance and I used to work in finance.

147
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 People I know that work in these kind of fields, they usually have fake friends and they just all like care about money and selfishness, but you guys are different.

148
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 You guys are different.

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Maybe he was just talking about Gabe.

150
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Maybe Gabe's just different.

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Not me.

152
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Gabe's a little bit different.

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 I'm joking.

154
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 But that's what we need to be as the king's people.

155
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Can we be in this world playing basketball with our friends, you know, eating with our friends and family, but can people see that there's something different about us?

156
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 You know, it's easy to play basketball and, you know, not care about the other people you're playing with and just be super aggressive and curse and whatnot.

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 You can do that, right?

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 But we wouldn't be the salt of the earth, right?

159
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 It's so easy to fall in the same sort of culture of those people, some people.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 I'm not saying everybody's like that, but it's easy to fall into that, the culture of the world.

161
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 But can we maintain our character, the character of the king?

162
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Can we shine forth the light of the king?

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And so we went through two things, the character, the calling, and now we're going to look at the covenant of the king, the covenant of the king.

164
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And it reads here, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.

165
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them."

166
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 But to fulfill them.

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 And what Jesus is saying here, and I'm going to summarize in five points, is that Jesus didn't come to abolish the law, right?

168
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Now, John sort of went through that, the book of Matthew was for the Jewish people, right?

169
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 And the law was given, you know, by Moses to the Jewish people.

170
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 He came instead, number two, point number two, is to fill the law.

171
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 And what does that mean, that he came to fulfill the law?

172
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Jesus points out something here, that even the smallest parts of the law are important.

173
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 They're significant.

174
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 That spiritual status is measured by their obedience to the law.

175
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 And that righteousness greater than the religious leaders of those times, the Pharisees and those who are the teachers of the law, are required to enter the kingdom of heaven.

176
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Righteousness that is greater than these religious leaders is required to enter the kingdom of heaven.

177
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Now, we know this about the old law.

178
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 The law came from the law of Moses, right?

179
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 It was, the consequence of it was sin and death.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 It was based on works.

181
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 You had to follow this, you had to follow that in order to be accepted.

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 It was about sacrifices.

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 You brought your lamb, your goat to the temple to be slaughtered so that blood would be shed, right?

184
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 The blood of animals would take on sort of our temporal punishment of our sins.

185
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 However, this was temporary.

186
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 It was powerless.

187
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 The law was powerless to save, right?

188
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And so, Jesus is saying that that is the old covenant.

189
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 It's important because we see God's redemptive work through that.

190
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 But I am here to say that the law is temporary.

191
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I have come to fulfill it.

192
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 I've come to fulfill it.

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And so, the new law is the law of the Messiah, the one who has come to save.

194
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 It's not a law of sin and death.

195
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 It is a law of the spirit of life.

196
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 The Holy Spirit has come and dwelled among us.

197
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 It's not just about our works anymore, but it's more importantly about our faith in the Messiah,

198
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 that he has come to save us.

199
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Instead of many sacrifices, it is the one ultimate sacrifice.

200
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And that is Jesus Christ himself.

201
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Once and for all, his blood shed on the cross so that he could save us from the condemnation of sin.

202
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Jesus comes with a new covenant.

203
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 He has fulfilled the Old Testament, the old laws.

204
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 You know, the old laws were written to Israelites, right?

205
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And that was already God raising the bar.

206
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 You know, they lived amongst people that were, you know, quite violent at those times.

207
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 And God already raised the bar of morality during that time with the law.

208
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And we're going to see next, Lee, the king's regulations.

209
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 In the king's regulations, the conduct of his people.

210
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 The conduct of his people.

211
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Now, the new standard of the king, he talks about that in terms of bad conduct and also good conduct.

212
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And so back then, they had standards according to the Old Testament on different topics,

213
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 such as murder, adultery, divorce, oaths, retaliation, and enemies.

214
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And in the law, it was following the Ten Commandments.

215
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Don't murder, right? On the topic of murder, don't murder.

216
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 You should not murder.

217
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 You should not commit adultery.

218
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 On the topic of divorce, it was the husbands must give a certificate of divorce.

219
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Oaths, don't make oaths.

220
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 On retaliation, this is the famous one, right?

221
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Give an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

222
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Just return exactly what your enemy has done towards you.

223
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 You do it back to them.

224
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And for your enemies, hate your enemies.

225
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 But in this Sermon of the Mount, Jesus gives a new conduct for his king's people.

226
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And he raises the standard.

227
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Now, it's not only don't murder, if you turn to the slide, it's not only don't murder.

228
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Jesus is not just talking about your actions.

229
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 He's talking about your thoughts.

230
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 That even in your thoughts, you can have bad conduct.

231
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And so he goes to another standard and says,

232
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 "Don't even be angry with your brothers and sisters.

233
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Don't even be angry."

234
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 And on the topic of adultery, it's not just your action of don't commit adultery.

235
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Don't even lust.

236
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Don't even have that first thought of lust.

237
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 That's where Jesus is targeting, is that where sin starts is in our minds.

238
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Jesus also raises the bar on what is acceptable for divorce.

239
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Jesus says that it's only valid in cases of sexual immorality.

240
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 He's raising the level, ethical and moral standards, right?

241
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Back then, they were used to giving oaths.

242
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 But Jesus is saying, "Let your yes be yes and your no be no."

243
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 In terms of retaliation, face the person that has wronged you and turn the other cheek.

244
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Turn the other cheek.

245
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Jesus calls us to love our enemies instead of hating them.

246
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Jesus is raising the bar, changing the standard.

247
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 The people of that time must have been like, "Whoa.

248
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 You want me to do this?"

249
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It would have been shocking for them.

250
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Jesus doesn't only have new standards on bad conduct, which are these sort of things.

251
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 But Jesus also raises the bar in terms of good conduct.

252
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 We see in the next slide that giving, people loved to give back then.

253
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Jesus tells of that story of the widow and that famous teacher of the law

254
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 who goes into the temple and drops in a lot of coins.

255
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 In that jar, it would ring.

256
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 But the poor widow came and just gave one.

257
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Jesus is saying here that the old standard was giving to the needy publicly.

258
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Give to the needy or the temple, the church, whatever, publicly.

259
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Do things for the approval of others.

260
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 That was their old way of thinking.

261
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Prayers were prayed wordly with many words in public.

262
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Fasting, they wanted to fast in public so that people could see the changes of their face.

263
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 And be like, "Yo, what's going on?" "Oh, I'm fasting.

264
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 I'm so tired. I'm so hungry. I'm fasting. Look at me."

265
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 But Jesus gives a new standard.

266
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 The new standard is instead of giving to the needy publicly, give in secret.

267
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 For those who give to the public have already received their reward from people.

268
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 The praise of people.

269
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 But if you give in secret, you will receive from the Father himself.

270
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 The Father will see and reward you accordingly.

271
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Prayers are not about how wordly they are or how public they are.

272
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Instead, Jesus is saying that God cares more about your heart,

273
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 the words inside your heart, and how genuine they are towards the Father.

274
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 And Jesus is also saying it's not about how many times you fast

275
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 and how public you are with that.

276
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Jesus is telling us to fast in secret.

277
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Jesus' new conduct, he's telling the people that his new conduct,

278
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 their new conduct should be genuine, of the heart, towards the Father,

279
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 not to please people.

280
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 So Jesus raises the standard of bad conduct, of good conduct.

281
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And this is similar to sort of what Martin Luther did with the 95 Thesis.

282
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Back then, most of Europe was sort of illiterate.

283
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 They didn't really read the Bible directly.

284
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 And so they trusted the popes, the priests of that time,

285
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 to tell them how they could go into heaven.

286
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And so the standards back then was sort of like,

287
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 oh, you have to give money to the church,

288
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 you have to come and see these relics and give tribute to the,

289
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 I don't know, the birthplace of Jesus or the coffin of Mary

290
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 or something like that.

291
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 I'm just making these things up.

292
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 And Martin Luther nails these 95 Thesis to the door of the Catholic Church

293
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 and says, "No, faith is what gets us into heaven,

294
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 not all these good works and giving to these different things

295
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 and paying tribute to these physical things.

296
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 No, it's about faith in Jesus Christ, not about works.

297
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 It's about Scripture, the Bible, what the Bible says,

298
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 not just what these different priests are coming up with."

299
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And so Martin Luther was counter-cultural to that time,

300
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 and Jesus is also counter-cultural to his time

301
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 in raising the bar and the standard.

302
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And he emphasized that sin can come from our minds, our thinking,

303
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 and we need to first stop it from there.

304
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Jesus also raises the conduct of good works,

305
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 that good works must be directed towards the Father,

306
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 not towards the approval of people.

307
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 So we looked at the character of the king's people,

308
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 the calling of the king's people, the king's covenant,

309
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 the new conduct of the king's people,

310
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 and lastly, we're going to look at the clarity.

311
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 The new clarity of the king's people.

312
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Before, the old view was that we stored up treasures in heaven.

313
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 We filled our barns so that there would be so much food,

314
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 and we can see that right now.

315
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 When people are panicking, they go to the store,

316
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 and all the stores are empty now.

317
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 They're trying to store up for themselves.

318
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 They're worrying about their own problems.

319
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Back then, they also worried about their own problems.

320
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 But Jesus says that the king's people do what instead?

321
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Instead of focusing on storing treasures just on earth,

322
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 there's a new focus, a clarity.

323
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 There's an eternal perspective.

324
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Instead of storing just treasures on earth,

325
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 the king's people store treasures in heaven.

326
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Heaven where moth and dust do not destroy,

327
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 where thieves do not come in and steal.

328
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Things of this earth will go away, as Jesus says.

329
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 The things of eternity, the things that we store up for the Lord,

330
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 will last forever.

331
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 There's a new clarity, a new perspective for those who are following the king.

332
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 In those times, they used to worry about their own problems.

333
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 But Jesus says, "Do not worry."

334
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Instead, we must seek first his kingdom and his righteousness,

335
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 and all these things will be given to us.

336
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 There is an eternal perspective, a new way of seeing things,

337
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 a clarity for those who are the king's people.

338
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Last year, we went on an awesome mission trip to the Philippines.

339
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 One of the girls that came on this trip,

340
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 she actually grew up in this church,

341
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 but she was never really involved in this church.

342
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Actually, she was sort of in and out of the church

343
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 because she had schooling in Canada.

344
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 When she came back for the summer, she didn't really feel like she fit in.

345
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 So, she was kind of in and out of the church.

346
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 But last summer, she decided to give it a shot,

347
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 to really get involved in church.

348
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 As she got involved more and more in church,

349
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I saw God changing her perspective.

350
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 God changing her perspective.

351
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Before, she was very worried about school, very worried about her future.

352
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 But now, she wanted to do what?

353
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 She wanted to trust God with her future.

354
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 So, she went on a mission trip for the first time,

355
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 and she shared the gospel with somebody,

356
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 and led them to Jesus for the first time.

357
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 That changed her perspective on life.

358
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 That it's not just about worldly things, or school, or my future job,

359
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 but that God could use me for His purposes and for His kingdom.

360
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 During our summer camp, God even called her.

361
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 We had a dedication night,

362
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 and she offered her life to full-time service of the Lord.

363
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 So, I saw within this girl, who was sort of in and out of our church,

364
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 not super committed to the faith,

365
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 become a person that truly valued eternal things.

366
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Sharing the gospel, even giving her part of her summer to go on a mission trip.

367
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 And in her future, she wants to commit her life to store up treasures in heaven.

368
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And so, we went through the character of the King's people,

369
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 the calling of the King's people,

370
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 the new covenant of the King,

371
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 the new conduct of the King's people,

372
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 and the new clarity of the King's people.

373
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 And what does it mean for us today, during these times?

374
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 How can this, the Sermon on the Mount,

375
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 what Jesus is saying in these two chapters, three chapters, five to seven,

376
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 what does it mean for us today at this time?

377
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Firstly, do we have the character of the King's people?

378
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Do we have the character of the King's people?

379
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Do we see our spiritual poverty, to be humble, spiritually hungry,

380
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 to seek righteousness, and to be at peace with others?

381
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Trial brings out our true character.

382
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Trials bring out our true character.

383
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And during these hard times, are we depending more and more on God?

384
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Or are we just turning to our own ways, trusting in ourselves?

385
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 During these times, are we seeking God more and more?

386
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Are we seeking God more and more?

387
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Are we showing more and more mercy and peace to those around us?

388
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Are we exemplifying the character of the King's people?

389
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Are we exemplifying the character of the King's people?

390
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Secondly, have we taken grasp of the King's calling

391
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 to be his salt and his light?

392
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 To be in this world, but not to be of this world.

393
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 To be like salt, to persevere, right?

394
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 To maintain the character of King's people,

395
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 and to be his light, to shine forth his goodness.

396
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 We have an amazing opportunity right now,

397
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 in the face of this pandemic, to shine forth his light.

398
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Like what we're doing with the campaign to hand out masks,

399
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 to hand out, you know, yeah, sanitizer.

400
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 We have an amazing opportunity to share his word,

401
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 to be the light of Christ.

402
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Are we doing that? Are we doing that?

403
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Do we understand and are we living the new covenant?

404
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Do we know what Jesus is talking about

405
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 when he says that he is the life, the truth, and the way?

406
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 He is the fulfillment, fulfillment of the law.

407
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Fourthly, are we acting in line

408
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 with the conduct of the King's people?

409
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Jesus raises the bar.

410
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Are we living under that same conduct?

411
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Is Jesus' standards our standards?

412
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Have we aligned ourselves to him?

413
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And lastly, do we have clarity on eternity?

414
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Do we have clarity on eternity?

415
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 We are in this world, but we are not of this world.

416
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 We are citizens of heaven.

417
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Do we have an eternal perspective?

418
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Are we seeking to store up treasures in heaven

419
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 and depending on God more and more?

420
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Let's have the band come up,

421
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 and I'm just going to close us off in prayer.

422
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word

423
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 that even though it was written 2,000 years ago,

424
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 it still applies to us today.

425
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 And I pray that, Lord, we would be your salt and your light.

426
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Teach us, Lord, how to shine forth your goodness,

427
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 to be hope to the hopeless.

428
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Lord, help us to have an eternal perspective

429
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 so, Lord, we wouldn't just be focused on the things of this earth,

430
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 but, Lord, have an eternal perspective

431
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 to store up treasures in heaven, to serve you.

432
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Bless us, Lord, during these times.

433
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
