[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Hello everyone, it's great to be on Zoom so I can get some interaction.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   You want to say hi in the chat box?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   I'm seeing people are responding.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   So today, during this sermon, it's going to be quite interactive.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   I will ask you some questions and feel free to type it in the chat box
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   and I'm going to read them out as you answer them.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   So let's start.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Today I'm just really excited because I want to share a message with you
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   on how we can treat God as God.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I don't know about you, but when we first learn about God,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   we learn that He's a loving Father and He gave us Jesus to take away our sins.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Many a times, we kind of take Him for granted
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   and after a while, we start using Him like a vending machine.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And it's actually extremely offensive to Him.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And so as much as He is a loving Father to us,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   He's also the Creator of the universe.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   He's holy and He's worthy of our absolute honor and respect.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   So today, I do want to go through the life of Japheth
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   in the book of Judges together with you.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And we'll go through quite a few chapters today, chapter 10, 11, and 12.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   So that way we can understand what are some of the pitfalls that we might have
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   while we worship God because we can easily fall into the same pitfalls
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   that we see from these characters.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   So today, it's a little bit of a heavier message,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   but it will bring us to really search our hearts to see if it's in the right place
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   so that we can treat God as God and build a much more authentic relationship with Him.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So let me give you some background first about these three chapters.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Now there are a lot of verses, so we won't be able to read through all of them,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   but I do want to give you some background.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   All right. If you cannot see the screen, please let me know.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   All right. So at the beginning of chapter 10, we actually find an account
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   where there are two short accounts of Tola and Jer.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And they're actually judges that have served the Israelites for 23 years
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   and 22 years respectively, but they only got six furs altogether.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And they have then died. And then beginning in verse 6,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   we see a similar pattern, which we have been seeing in the Book of Judges.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   You should know by now, as the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   they served a number of foreign gods and forsake God.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   So the author here actually lists out, I have listed it out for you,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   seven gods that they have been serving.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And so God now is extremely angry and sold them into the hands of the Philistine,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   as well as the Ammonites. And the people were crushed and then they were oppressed now for 18 years.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Now, the first question you can get ready with your chat box is,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   can anybody remember what the people of Israelites usually do when they are oppressed?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   What do they do? Let's see if I see any answers.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   When they're oppressed, what do they do? Cry out to God.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   All right, Agnes, Toby, Grace. That's right.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   They've been crying out to God. And what does God usually do?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He usually, oh, you don't have to answer that one.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   So God usually answers to them, but silently he will raise up new judges.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Now, interestingly, we find that in here, God actually breaks the cycle of silence
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   because usually he just raise up a new judge without saying anything.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Instead, this time God spoke back. And this is what he said.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   He said, "Did I not save you from these oppressors?"
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   We'll see the list in a moment. "And you cried out to me and I saved you out of their hands.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods. Therefore, I will save you no more.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Go and cry out to the gods whom you have chosen. Let them save you in time of distress."
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And so we can see God is saying, "Sorry, guys, no go this time. You're on your own.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Go to your God. Don't come to me when you're being oppressed."
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And so what we find is that God lists them out, which is breaking the cycle in a way
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   because for previous judges that we have seen or previous chapters,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   he just replies to their cries and he raises a judge.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   But this time he's like, "Nope, you've been serving these people.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I've already delivered you from these seven oppressors and you're still doing it."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And what we see is that interestingly enough, he has raised seven judges up to this time.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Now, I don't know about you, this 777, does it say anything?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Well, if you were God, this is my question.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   If you were God, would you save the Israelites again?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   You can use the chat box now. No. Okay. I see a firm no.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Anybody else? Of course. All right. Some people say, "Of course."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Now, let's put it in perspective.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   What if it was your wife or husband or spouse who has been unfaithful to you for seven times?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Is that going to be a yes or a no? That's a rhetorical question.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   You can answer it for yourself.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   But yes, I see that some people say yes, some people say no.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Actually, I want to say for me, that's going to be a no.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Maybe they won't even get through all seven times.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   But what we find here is that God is full of compassion and mercy.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   He continues to give Israelites a chance.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And this kind of reminds me of a Bible verse in the New Testament, where Peter asked Jesus,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   he says, he asked Jesus, "How often should he forgive a brother who sinned against him?
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Was it seven times enough?"
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   And Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but 77 times."
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And here we can see that God is evidently patient and compassionate towards Israelites.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It's very hard for humans to do it, but for God, he has this compassion for them,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   and he's still waiting for them.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And that will bring us to our very first point, which is, since God loves us so much,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   don't use God, instead love him.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Now, what we see here is that the Israelites only called out to God when,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   whenever they're desperately in need of his deliverance.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Now, for 18 years, you know, it seemed like they didn't call out to God,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   and they just tried other gods.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And at this moment where they cannot do any more things,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   because they've been oppressed to a point where they know they have to go back to God,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   it's almost like going to God as like a vending machine,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   where in times of trouble, that's the only time they reach out.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And other times, they didn't want to be bothered with God.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   They don't want to serve him.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And it's interesting.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   We would wonder, why is it -- why can't these Israelites just serve one God?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   What is this about serving all the other gods?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Well, if we see what is the cost of serving God,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   maybe we'll kind of have an idea of why these people just can't serve God alone.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Well, we see in Deuteronomy Chapter 11, it says there,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   "Love the Lord your God and always keep his mandate and his statutes, ordinances, and commands.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   No one will be able to stand against you," it says in Deuteronomy.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Now, what we realize is there is a price in following God.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And the price is you've got to love him,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   and that you're going to have to follow his way of doing things.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And obviously, the Israelites don't want to do that.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   They just want to live their path.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   They want to live their life doing their things.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   And so we're faced with similar challenges ourselves as the Israelites.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   They believe in God, too. They believe in God.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   They believe in him so much that he knows he's the one that will deliver them.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   But that's not enough for them.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And so when everything's going fine, they just want to go off on their own.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And that's the same with us sometimes.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   When we are going through peaceful times, we just go off and do our own things,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   and we don't spend time with God.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   And now I remember when it was earlier in my days where I used to attend church only,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   and actually at that time I was already baptized.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I was in my early 20s.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And I would go to God whenever I needed something,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   like if I needed to go to a certain school, or if I had a certain problem,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   or if I wanted to get a certain job.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I prayed more desperately, and I would read the Bible more earnestly.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I might even fast, you know, and just try to get him to do something for me.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And then, you know, once the problems are solved, I would just go back to my normal life,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   which is I didn't quite read that much Bible at that time, and I also just did things my way.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I didn't particularly think what he liked or how I should do so that I would be following his ways.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   And so it wasn't up until one point where I really thought,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   "Am I treating God as God, or is he just someone I go to for problems?"
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And once I begin to have that thought, I started to just say,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   "God, I really can't sit down for like an hour and spend time with you, and I'm really sorry,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   but I want to start maybe just two, three minutes either just doing a prayer or reading a devotional."
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And eventually, I got a devotional material where I just started reading one story a day,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   but I actually didn't do it every day either.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   You know, I think the frequency was like less than 50% of the time, I have to be very honest with you.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   But interestingly enough, when I started doing that, eventually, I think after a couple of months,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   God really started speaking to me through those two minutes or three minutes.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And I started to feel like, "Oh, we're building a relationship."
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And I started reading more often, so it went from like less than 50% to like 70%,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   and it was gradually growing.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And eventually, I actually got two devotional materials, and I also started reading the Bible
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   because God was speaking to me, and I felt like I was building an authentic relationship with Him,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   and I was no longer just going to Him for problems.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   I mean, yes, I still go to Him for my more urgent and desperate problems now,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   but I feel like it's not out of using Him, but because He is my Father, and we have built this relationship.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   So this isn't being legalistic about spending time or doing this, meaning certain things,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   but really just wanting God and not wanting the gifts from Him.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And so we need to treat God as God, and we can look, and we can't just look for Him when we're in trouble,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   we have to love Him, we have to build a relationship with Him.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   So now let's read on to Chapter 11.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   "And immediately after the Israelites cried out to the Lord, the people of Gilead,"
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   which is one of the tribes, "asked, 'Whoever in the land can fight against the Ammonites,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   that person will be the head over the Gileads.'
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And there was a man called Japheth," which is our main character today,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   "who was a mighty warrior, except he was the son of a prostitute."
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   So the elders and also his brother, his half-brother actually, kicked him out of the town,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   so then he would not take over some of the inheritance of the father.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   "Now eventually when the Ammonites made war, the elders of Gilead got so desperate
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   that they went to him and said, 'Please just come back and be our leader.'
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   And of course, you know, he was like, 'No, I'm not going to come back that easily.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Are you going to be sure that I would be your head, or are you going to ask me to fight and then get rid of me?'
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   And so they promised him that they will make him their head."
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And so what we find is that first he tried to approach the Ammonite king
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   to see if he could talk them out of war or battle, but then he wasn't,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   and they were about to go to battle.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And this is what was recorded in chapter 11, verse 29 to 32.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   "Then the spirit of the Lord was upon Jethed. He passed on to the Ammonites,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and Jethed made a vow to the Lord and said, 'If you will give me the Ammonites into my hand,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   then whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   from the Ammonites shall be the Lord's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.'
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   So Jethed crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the Lord gave them into his hand."
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Now this was a victorious, stunning battle, and Jethed actually captured another 20 cities.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Then Jethed, when he has won this battle and he went back to his home,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   the first person that came out to meet him, can you guess who it is? It is his daughter.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Now his daughter comes out with the tambourines and dancing, and he tore his clothes out
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   because he's greatly distressed now, and he tells her that he had made a vow to the Lord.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And his daughter actually understood what that meant, because at that time,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   other gods would have human sacrifices. And so they were really depressed,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   and his daughter said that she needed two months to mourn because she was still a virgin,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   and she will never know any man or be married or have children.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   And so after those days, she returned to Jethed, and he did what he vowed,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   which is having a human sacrifice at that time. And so this, you know, up to this point,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   I don't know about you, but I'm feeling like, oh, this is not a good story.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   And these records actually make us feel very uncomfortable, because as a reader,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   we can see that this tragedy can actually be avoided, and yet we sympathize
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   for this innocent girl who didn't do anything wrong. Now, what is the author trying to tell us here?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And so my question to you, and you can use the chat box, is,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   do you think that the author is trying to tell us not to manipulate or control God with our vowels?
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Now, can you let me know yes or no?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   The screen share has disappeared. Can you guys see my sharing?
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   We can see. Okay, great. All right. Oh, yes, yes. All right.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   So I see a lot of people replying, saying that they think the author is trying to tell us
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   just don't manipulate or control God. Oh, somebody said, I don't know. Okay.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   And so I wanted to tell you the people, all of you who said yes, you are very smart,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   because I thought like that, too. But that's when the but comes in.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Is I thought about, you know, is this about God asking us not to control him,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   not to manipulate him with our vows and, you know, to sweeten the deal when we're desperate for something?
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   However, at a closer look, we reveal that vowing or is not necessarily the question here,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   because do you remember someone by the name of Hannah?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Hannah was a late was a wife of she was a wife in the Old Testament time where she desperately wanted a son,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   but she was not able to conceive. And so she prayed this vow to God, saying that if you give me a son,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   I will give him to you. And the Lord did answer her vow.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   And she did give her son to to the Lord all his life.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And that is the prophet Samuel. And so looking at this, it seems like, wait a minute,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   I think God is kind of OK with vows. And if we look at Ecclesiastics, chapter five, verse four to six,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   we're going to see that it is reported that when you vow a vow to God, do not delay in paying it.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Pay what you vow. It is better that you should not vow than if you vow and not pay.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   So apparently there seems to be like this this rule or this teaching from the Bible about what vows should be like.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   So more or less, we might be thinking, I think vows are OK, although the Bible did say if you were to vow,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   make a vow, then you are to repay it because it also says in Ecclesiastics that don't tell don't tell the messenger,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   which is the angel, that it was a mistake. Like, oh, I made a mistake.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   He says, don't say that. So it seems like God's OK with it.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   So, again, what is the author trying to tell us if it was, quote unquote, OK to have the vow?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Well, the problem really here, I think that what the author is trying to say is that the problem is that he arrogantly vowed
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   on something that he thought he would be willing to pay only to find that it was more than he signed up for.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   So this brings us to our second point, which is don't be arrogant, but humbly depend on God.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Now, what does this mean? Well, we can't help but think that.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Why is it that he had to say whatever, whatever that comes out of the door of his home?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I mean, the word in Hebrew actually also means whoever.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   OK, so it's whatever or whoever. I mean, honestly, what did he expect to come out of his home?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   I mean, it's his wife or daughter. I mean, that was his only child.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   So either he really didn't like his wife and decided I'm going to scheme away to get rid of her.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Or like, what was he actually thinking? And what we see is that at those time,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   they would have lived in something called a four room house, which means that there would be animals in there as well as human beings.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   So most likely he was thinking of sacrificing an animal.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   But, you know, he could have just been humble about his willingness to give up everything for God.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And instead he could have just said something simple like when I come back with victory,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   I will burn an offering of a lamb or whatever to God.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   And that would have sufficed. But he didn't do that.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   So instead of being humble, he actually said he would give anything or whatever.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And that's really overly being arrogant about how much it is that he's willing to give to the Lord.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   And now just on a side note, by the way, this is just for fun, is that if he actually knew the book of laws well,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   he would know that God is against human sacrifices in Deuteronomy chapter 18.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   And that even if he did make a special vow that is involving a person's value,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   he could have actually paid 30 shekels for a female in lieu of the vow.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   But anyways, it just shows that he doesn't really know his stuff.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   That's just a side note for your information.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   And now we might be actually for us, we might be very similar to Japheth as well.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   We may or may not say a vow to God, but in our hearts,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   we might arrogantly think that we're more spiritual than we actually are.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   I mean, why do I say that? Because we might overestimate our spirituality and make ourselves trapped into our words.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   And we need to be careful the words that we speak to God because we need to treat him as God.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And so I want to share with you about how I was very arrogant at one time because I just finished a master's.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   When I first finished a master's degree in ministry at Agape, I just thought to myself, you know what?
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   I'm on fire for God. I can do anything for him.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   So I pray this prayer, which I will never pray again, which is I said to God, I'm willing to do anything for you.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Just send me out to whatever job you want within these two months.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   You know, I don't know how long it's going to take. Right. And I'm just going to go wherever you send me.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   So, you know, honestly, I was very, very. How should I say it?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I was being very cunning because I was not sending out one resume. So I'm like, all right, God, I'll see how you can come up with a job for me.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And then eventually someone asked me if I would translate at an event, which I said yes to.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   And after the event, the pastor came over and he actually works in an NGO.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   And he asked me, hey, would you like to work for my NGO? And I was like, oh, no, I prayed this prayer.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   I think I have to say yes. So I said yes. And let's just say, well, try not to guess which NGO or which pastor that was.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   But after like the first week, I already wanted to quit because they had four people there and I was already one of the four.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And I used to work at a multi-billion, you know, a company that probably had 4000 employees.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   And they worked on like Chinese cultural things, which I was very, very unfamiliar with.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Long story short, it was totally nothing like what I had expected. Maybe I was like Jeff that as well.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   I thought it would have been like a goat or a lamb that I had to sacrifice. I didn't think that it would be this much.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And so just guess how long I stayed, guys. Two and a half years because I didn't dare to leave.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And I just wanted to say that at that time, I overestimated what I could do for God.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   And I arrogantly thought that I was more willing to give things up than I really was.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And I think for us also, sometimes our arrogance will may not come in like a form of a vow, but it might be something in our heart.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   For example, maybe when we're sinning in a certain area, we might tell God, God, we're so sorry. I'm so sorry.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I'm never going to do this again. You know, I'm never going to do this again. Are you sure?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   And we might start promising him like, all right, if I do this again, take away this from me.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Like this is something I really cherish. And, you know, we might, we are, we might be very authentic at that moment.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   But at the same time, it's an arrogant act for us to overestimate how much we can give for God.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And so now even before coming to KSC, I actually prayed another prayer.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   And the prayer goes like this, Father God, please give me strength to do what you want me to do
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   or allow me to be able to carry out what you or go to the, have enough faith to go to the places that you want me to go.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Because I really don't dare to pray that prayer or say those things anymore.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   So let's treat God as God and humbly just depend on him.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   So let us continue now into Chapter 12. In Chapter 12, we'll only go through verse 1 to 7.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And in this section, we see that the men of Ephraim, which is another tribe of Israel,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   they actually went up to Japheth and he, the men of Ephraim, threatened to burn down his house.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   We're like, why? Why are they threatening to do that? Well, that's because they claim that Japheth did not invite them into this victorious battle.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   And so because of that, they're going to burn down his house.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Now, Japheth, on the other hand, says this. He says, "And when I saw that you would not come to save me, you being the men of Ephraim,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I took my life in my hand and crossed over against Ammonite, and the Lord gave them into my hand.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?"
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   So here we can see that he's trying to tell the men of Ephraim, I did invite you. You didn't come.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   But in the text, it actually doesn't say whether or not he did invite.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   But what we see is that after this dialogue, without waiting, Japheth and his men fought against the men of Ephraim.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   And the author tells us that 42,000 of the men of Ephraim died.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And that's basically wiping out their defense power.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Now, at this turn of event, we don't know what to make of it,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   because God just delivered the people of Israelites from the Ammonites.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And now they're causing for themselves civil war, which could totally be avoided.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   So what is it, again, what is the author trying to tell us here?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   All of a sudden, there's this insert of the men of Ephraim fighting against Japheth.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   And this actually brings us to our third point, because instead of celebrating what God is doing,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   actually both Japheth and the men of Ephraim, what they're trying to do,
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   they just wanted to prove themselves as greater, better, more important.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   So they're exalting themselves instead of God.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   So my third point is don't exalt yourself, exalt God.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Now, and this is very, very common, because as we read what Japheth said,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   he actually said, "I took my life and God gave the Ammonites to me in my hands."
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   So it's more like he's focusing on how God has favored him, how God has been with him.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   And he's literally using God to say, "Hey, I'm the more favored one.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   I'm the one that is superior to you, and I am more and better."
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And whenever we exalt, whenever Japheth exalts himself like that,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   he's not able to have compassion for his brothers at all.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Even if they were doing the wrong things, he saw himself to be the righteous one.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   And he's not leaving any room for his brother.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Now, similarly, the men of Ephraim also questioned why Japheth didn't invite them.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   He's almost saying like, "Hey, you didn't invite me to this party,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   and I'm going to burn down your house."
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   And, well, that's probably another way to say that I'm too important
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   to not be in any winning battle.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   And this really allowed, you know, this just makes us think,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   what are these men thinking, you know?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   We just want to battle. Can't we just have a moment of peace?
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   But we realize that when men and women, it just happens to be men here,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   wanted to exalt themselves, it actually blinds us.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   It's almost like we can't see the log that's in our eyes,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   and the only thing we could see is the speck in other people's eyes.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Now, this is not so much talking about right and wrong.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   This is talking about how far will you go to prove that you are right?
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   I mean, just because you're right doesn't mean you need to give people a hard time,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   and it doesn't mean that, well, for them, they killed 42,000 men,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   and it doesn't mean for you to, like, burn down another person's house.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   So it's a matter of how much compassion or mercy do we still have for our brothers
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   when they "have wronged us" or we think they have wronged us?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And when we exalt ourselves, we're never going to see that.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   When we exalt ourselves, we just see their flaws.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   But if we exalt God, then we're going to know that we are also sinners,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   and it is God that is the only perfect and right person.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And so we begin to have the right perspective, and we humble ourselves,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   and we're able to extend that compassion and mercy to another person.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   And now, I mean, recently with a lot of things that happen in Hong Kong,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   I think it's not easy to do this because a lot of times, no matter what stance we have,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   it's easy for us to say our side is right.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   This is the way to look at things.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And honestly, only God knows what is right,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   and He is the only one who can judge.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   But along the way, when we're trying to prove that we are right,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   what kind of measures will we take?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Will we go all the way out?
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Are we going to wipe out--I mean, using this analogy, burn down people's house--
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   are we going to wipe out 42,000 men?
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Or are we going to be able to say, "God is the only one who knows what's right.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Even if I was right and someone was wrong, I can still have the compassion
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   because I'm a sinner, and I do wrong things all the time too,"
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   and be really having that right perspective and give it all back to God
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   to be the judge and to be the one that is in control
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   and exalting Him and all the works that He does.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   So today I just really want to just share one message,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   even though there are three points, which is just for us to reflect,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   are we treating God as God in our lives?
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   I mean, are we using Him in the times where we want or where we need deliverance,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   when we need something?
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Is that the only time we go to Him?
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Do we want to build a relationship with Him?
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   And if not, it's time for us to be challenged and think, "I need to change.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   I need to do something that's different because I don't want to keep using God anymore."
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   And I'm sure that's all of us here wanting to build a more authentic relationship with Him.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   And also at the same time, we don't want to be arrogant.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   We don't want to overcompromise, thinking that we can tell God how spiritual we are
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   and overpromise on things that we can't do, but instead we can just humbly just depend on Him.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And whatever things that we are having a problem with, we can just tell Him that we need Him
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   and we need to depend on Him.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   And thirdly, not to exalt ourselves because when we do that,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   it's easy for us to come into conflict with other people, demanding that to prove that we're right.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   And sometimes while we prove that we're right, we use extreme measures.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   We might badmouth someone.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   We might just hate them and we might even unfriend them and never talk to them.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   We might just go to the extremes to prove that we're right.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   But remembering that we're sinners and only God is the one that we can exalt
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   will put us back into the right perspective.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   So today, I pray that it will be a chance for us to reflect as we look at Japheth
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   and the different people in this story to really rethink just one question.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Are we treating God as God or something else?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   And I strongly encourage all of us that we need to treat Him as God
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   and for no other reason other than He is God.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   So right now, I want to pray for all of us as we close in this message,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   asking God to speak to us.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Let's pray together.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Dear Heavenly Father, we just want to come before you and we just repent
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   because there must be times when we just use you.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   There are times when we didn't care about building a relationship with you,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   but instead we just wanted you to help us with this problem or that problem.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   And Father, there are also other times when we just think we are so spiritual
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   that we could give you anything only to find that it was such an arrogant act
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   that we just needed to tell you that we need you and we can't do it
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   and humble ourselves.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   And Father, we're really sorry for those times and we pray that you will help us.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   And Father, more than not, we fight with one another.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   And for what reason than to really exalt ourselves and to say that we are the one
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   that's right, we are the one that's more important,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   when all along you are the only person that's right and important.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   And so Father, we pray that we'll continue to see ourselves as sinners
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   that are being gracefully loved by you so that we could love other people as well.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And Father, you are our God and today we come before you
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   and we want to treat you as our God.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   And Father, we pray for your Holy Spirit to help us
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   so that our lives is a way that we give you as an offering.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   And Father, we pray that your Holy Spirit will be a way that we give you
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   so that your lives will be pleasing to you.
