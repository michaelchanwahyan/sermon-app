[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   - And good evening, everybody, and good evening to those who've chosen to watch in the dry
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.320]   at home, in your own home.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.560]   You're welcome here with us.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:22.120]   I get the privilege to kick off this new series, Church Together.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.200]   It's a series that I am particularly excited about.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:36.760]   Now you know, yes, I'm always really excited, but I am really excited about these next six
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.640]   weeks.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.240]   I remember speaking here, well, I think it was on Zoom about 18 months ago, and I was
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.880]   commenting about people who were saying to me, "I can't wait to get back to church."
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.880]   Have you heard that, right?
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.080]   "I can't wait to get back to church," as we were doing Zoom week after week.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:07.720]   And I remember saying to them, you'll remember this, "The church you want to get back to
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.920]   doesn't exist."
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:20.840]   As I encouraged the church to reset, renew, and revive.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:31.400]   Eighteen months later, and five COVID waves later, what does the church look like?
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:46.040]   Well, church physical numbers worldwide are down 40 to 50%, but online numbers have literally
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.280]   soared.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.680]   Churches have begun to take their focus on just their Sunday service or their Saturday
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:04.880]   service and began reaching out, feeding the poor, caring for those struggling with the
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:13.200]   physical, emotional, and practical strain of a world that was suddenly different, with
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:22.320]   war and hatred compounding the virus effects.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.980]   In short, I believe this.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.840]   We have begun to be the church rather than doing church.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.980]   Let me say it again.
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:43.040]   We have begun to be the church instead of doing church.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:52.280]   The pandemic seems to have taken particularly its toll on several so-called mega churches.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:01.680]   And what we've seen, haven't we, in our newspapers, high profile failures, including reported
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.600]   abuse of staff and congregation and serious moral failures that have been featured everywhere
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.440]   in the press and the social media.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.560]   I'll be honest with you, this has really saddened me.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.120]   So in response, I started to pray.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:33.560]   I started to dialogue with other church leaders here in Hong Kong and around the world.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.840]   And I waited on God.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.480]   As I waited, this is what I believe God encouraged me with only about a month or so ago.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.240]   I saw a picture of a chair with four legs.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.720]   And I was led to the early church in Acts 2, the passage that Michelle just read, and
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.560]   sensed that God is raising up His church in this season to be the church He intended it
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.560]   to be.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.000]   I've put a picture on the screen.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.440]   This is what I believe the churches look like.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:22.880]   Historically, we as the worldwide church have tended to balance our churches on single legs,
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   like great preaching, great worship, or even great venues, maybe even big donors.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.000]   Now all this has been stripped away, maybe forever.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:52.400]   And the four legs that I see are prayer, community, generosity, and the Word of God.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.440]   I'll say that again.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.080]   Prayer, community, generosity, and the Word of God.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.560]   I believe that when these are aligned, when we have these four legs in place, evangelism
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.960]   will flow.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.560]   Perhaps I believe through the workplace, it's the only place where numbers can be added
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.560]   daily.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:27.520]   And I believe that God said this to me, "I am gonna turn the world's perceptions of church
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.600]   upside down."
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   Too often we've based our perception on the reputation of a pastor or a leader.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.240]   And this has been flawed in recent times.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.800]   Or by the size of a church's ministry.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:06:03.920]   From here on in, the success of the church shall be determined by the love of the people.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.560]   John 13, 35.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:17.400]   My friends, it is a new day and it is a new way.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.080]   Welcome to our series.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:29.040]   We are gonna focus on the early believers in Acts chapter 2 and spend some time over
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:38.920]   the next few weeks to look closely at them and how they did church.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:48.160]   Acts 2 tells us how the Holy Spirit miraculously reversed the curse of Babel.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.760]   Have you thought of that?
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:59.440]   The story of the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11 explains the origins of the multiplicity
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.800]   of languages.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.840]   God was concerned that humans had blasphemed by building a huge tower.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:16.160]   And when I say huge, it was apparently a reported 1.6 miles high.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.920]   That's three times the height of the Burj Khalifa.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.640]   And I've been to the top of Burj Khalifa.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.640]   That's high.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.200]   Why did they build it?
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.120]   To avoid a second flood.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:38.640]   So God brought into existence multiple languages.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:47.360]   And here we see that God reversed the curse of Babel and instead created a new community
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.160]   through the gospel.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:58.040]   The picture we see of this first century AD community is a wonderful reminder of what
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.040]   church can be.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.600]   Philip Yancey in his amazing book, I think it's one of my favorite books, "What's So
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.640]   Amazing About Grace?"
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:17.440]   He said this, "At the height of the Cold War, Billy Graham visited Russia to meet with their
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.640]   political and religious leaders.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:29.440]   Many conservatives in the US criticized him for not taking a more prophetic role.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:35.640]   One accused him of setting the church back 50 years."
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.680]   I love Billy Graham's response.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.040]   He said, "Yeah, I'm deeply ashamed.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:51.200]   I've been trying very hard to set the church back 2000 years."
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:09:02.840]   And as it were, we are going back to the future, 2000 years and taking a look at this first
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.880]   church.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:11.360]   What we notice first of all is this, we notice a healthy posture.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.340]   I say a healthy posture because I wish I had one, right?
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:21.420]   Now a word of warning, we must not glamorize the early church.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.180]   They had their own set of problems.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:31.800]   A perfect church has never existed and never will.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:40.340]   And another word of warning, being a Christian doesn't mean nostalgically looking back to
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.980]   the good old days.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:55.300]   We can and we will look at how the early church related to God, to one another and to the
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.300]   world.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:03.300]   And what we will find is a beautiful picture, a beautiful picture of how the church with
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:11.460]   all its imperfections can be a community like no other.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:23.740]   Let's consider the three postures of the early church, inward, upward, and outward.
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.940]   The church had a healthy inward posture.
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:35.980]   Upon receiving baptism, these 3000 new believers immediately began devoting themselves to one
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.260]   another.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:45.000]   This church had a healthy upward posture.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.740]   This new community experienced God deeply.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.800]   And the church had a healthy outward posture.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:05.860]   This community not only moved toward God and knew each other well, but they also moved
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.140]   toward the world.
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:17.340]   The early church, though flawed, is a wonderful model for us.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:25.260]   The way it emulated these postures is a challenge for all churches today and for us here at
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:30.360]   KFCI.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.340]   So we will be examining these areas.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:40.660]   We'll be asking hard questions and resting in the gospel to find strength and motivation
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.340]   to fulfill them.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:53.900]   That's why Christ gave himself up to create a community like nothing the world has ever
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.740]   seen.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:06.060]   May we be that community.
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:15.260]   But for today, by way of introduction, I want to set this in context.
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.300]   We sang the line, didn't we?
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:23.380]   And the church of Christ was born and the spirit lit the flame in the song, "King of
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.380]   Kings."
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.780]   I love this line.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.980]   Every time I sing this line, it gives me goosebumps.
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:36.540]   The church of Christ was born and the spirit lit the flame.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:45.420]   And Acts chapter 1 and chapter 2 tell the story of how the resurrected Jesus had ascended
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.700]   to the Father.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:54.020]   So the promise of the Father, the precious Holy Spirit, would be poured out on the church,
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:13:02.180]   fulfilling the prophecy shared in the book of Joel centuries before.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:09.740]   But what I want to do before we focus on Acts 2, 42 to 47, you're going to hear those verses
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.040]   quite a lot the next few weeks.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.700]   What I want to do is to set the scene, as it were.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:29.980]   As I reread chapters 1 and 2, I was reminded of four prerequisites to the birth of the
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.660]   early church.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.100]   And they can be summarized in four words.
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:41.540]   And they are effectively the entry points for our series.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:53.380]   And they are waiting, togetherness, receiving, and boldness.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.020]   Let me say them again.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:02.660]   Waiting, togetherness, receiving, and boldness.
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.660]   Let's look at them one at a time.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.660]   Waiting.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:06.660]   Who are we waiting on?
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.440]   Waiting on God, of course.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.380]   In chapter 1, on one occasion while he was eating with them, he gave him this command.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.260]   Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.140]   Wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:29.020]   John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:35.460]   That word wait, I put the Greek up there, perimenein, is to wait for, to wait.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.580]   None of us enjoy waiting, do we?
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:46.460]   Oh, what do you think about these telephone, hotlines, right?
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.800]   For English press, one, for Canadian press, two.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   What department do you want?
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.800]   I've got no idea.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.060]   One, two, three, four, five, six.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.360]   And oh my goodness, if you want this and that.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.740]   So many decisions and they're saying that.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.300]   Eventually you get around to speak to a customer service representative, press zero.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.100]   We all do that, right?
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:13.100]   Now it says, "Your customer service representative will be with you in a moment."
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.460]   Fifteen minutes later, no one.
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.260]   And then the voice comes on and you know there are call centers somewhere in the Philippines
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.940]   or India, right, when they speak to you anyway.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.100]   No one enjoys waiting.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:38.420]   I'm learning that waiting on God is actually very important in our relationship with Him.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:44.100]   And it plays a key role in our spiritual development.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:51.620]   Waiting does not have to create bitterness, anger, or loss of hope.
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:59.140]   It can establish a deeper trust and knowledge of who God is and His love for you.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:09.780]   I pray, I pray that you would experience Him intimately as we wait on Him.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.540]   But think about it for a moment.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:19.380]   Jesus told His disciples to wait.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.020]   He didn't say how long for, right?
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:28.460]   They did not know how long they would have to wait.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:36.720]   Imagine me inviting you to a prayer meeting with no end time.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.940]   This prayer meeting lasted 10 days.
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.500]   Could you imagine going to a 10-day prayer meeting and before you went, you didn't know
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.940]   when it was going to end?
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.780]   Now what was the reason they were able to endure this?
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:17:01.620]   In my opinion, it was togetherness.
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:09.180]   In Acts 2, verse 1, we read, "When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.940]   in one place."
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:11.940]   Interesting that phrase.
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:21.900]   The Greek word for "in one place," omathumodon, is translated in some other versions of "with
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.900]   one accord."
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:32.460]   Actually, what it means is they were in the same place physically, like we are tonight,
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:38.260]   but they were in the same place spiritually.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:46.740]   It means being unanimous, having mutual consent, being in agreement, having group unity, having
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.980]   one mind and purpose.
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.980]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:56.340]   Unity is not uniformity.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:02.980]   We don't have to look like each other, think like each other, or act like each other.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.640]   But we can, I believe, and I believe this church can.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:15.020]   We can be of one heart, one mind, and one purpose.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:22.260]   Let's read on to see what happened as the result of being one.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:28.220]   "When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.780]   They were all of one accord.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:38.640]   Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came up from heaven and filled the whole
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.500]   house where they were sitting.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:46.420]   They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.420]   them.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:54.080]   All of them, all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.560]   tongues as the Spirit enabled them."
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.040]   A little bit of background here.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.940]   Jerusalem, it was the feast of Pentecost.
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.020]   It was filled with visitors.
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:14.840]   They were God-fearing Jews from all over the known world, gathering to give thanks for
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:23.420]   the first of the harvest and to celebrate the giving of the law to Moses on Mount Sinai.
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.420]   And isn't it amazing?
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.500]   It is here.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:37.060]   Not in a secret stable, not on a lonely mountaintop, but in the middle of a city.
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.980]   It calls way bay, right?
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:43.780]   In the middle of a city bursting with people who had come to see Him.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.340]   Isn't it amazing?
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.020]   That was where God showed up.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:57.060]   God, the creator of the universe, who had existed from before the beginning of time,
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.760]   is physically present by His Holy Spirit.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.900]   We read that wind from heaven fills the whole house.
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.300]   Wind just like Elijah felt in the cave.
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:17.720]   Fire, like Moses saw at the bush that didn't burn up.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:24.500]   Like the fire that consumed Elijah's soaking sacrifice.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:37.820]   And God speaks, not through a prophet or a priest, or in our case, a famous pastor, but
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:45.620]   through 120 uneducated, uncultured Galileans.
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:52.420]   So that everyone can hear and understand in their own language.
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.340]   I have a theory here.
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.880]   It's only my theory.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.360]   This was not so much a gift of tongues, but a gift of ears.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.460]   Because we read they were able to hear this in their own language.
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:10.560]   So it's quite likely that somebody was speaking something and two people or a number of people
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.800]   heard it in their own language.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:20.360]   It is the story of the Tower of Babel in reverse.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:27.880]   When the visitors eventually go home, they will return changed.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.000]   Taking with them the experience of Pentecost.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.960]   The Spirit living in them.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.920]   The law written in their hearts.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:41.200]   The first fruits of a new life in Christ.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.160]   And then lastly, we see boldness.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.120]   Now I want to tell you a joke now, but the only people in this room who are going to
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.760]   get this joke will be James and Paul.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.320]   It's a cricket joke, right?
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.800]   You know what cricket is?
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.400]   Someone says to me, "Where does cricket occur in the Bible?"
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.400]   It's here.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.000]   Peter went out with the 11 and was bold.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   You won't understand that.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.200]   I don't expect you to, but humor me for a moment.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:14.880]   But what it meant was that Peter put his hand up.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:26.640]   Peter, the denier, who had denied Jesus three times, became Peter the evangelist.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.040]   That's why we have John chapter 21 and the story of Peter's restoration.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.240]   Why Jesus asked Peter three times, "Do you love me?"
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:42.600]   And our team, we were there at that spot, weren't we, three years ago, where Jesus said
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.520]   to Peter, "Do you love me?"
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:52.960]   Now we've got to remember here that Jews from all over the known world are in Jerusalem
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.960]   for the Feast of Pentecost.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:03.760]   So Peter takes his opportunity and he begins to preach.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.680]   Throughout the sermon, Peter hammers away at a single point.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:19.480]   Jesus Christ is Lord and Saviour and people must put their faith in Him.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:29.640]   This turning to Jesus in faith is summarized in a simple charge in verse 38, "Repent and
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.880]   be baptized."
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.300]   What are these Jews to repent of?
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:45.120]   It is their rejection of Jesus as Messiah and Saviour.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:52.920]   And then we come to the result, verse 41, "So those who received His word were baptized
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:24:00.800]   and there were added that day about 3,000 souls."
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.300]   I've got to come clean now.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:15.100]   If I was Peter, if I was the disciples, what I would have done after 3,000 responses to
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:22.020]   my altar call, I would have started planning the next evangelistic meeting.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.460]   Maybe we need a bigger venue.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.740]   Oh, let's get our best worship band in, right?
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:28.740]   Who knows?
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:33.340]   Next time it might be 5,000 or 10,000.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:42.100]   But my friends, the lesson is that church is not a one-and-a-half-hour service.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:50.620]   Church is not even a gospel meeting or an evangelistic rally.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:25:01.580]   Over the next six weeks, we're going to be looking at how the early church responded
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:07.620]   to this influx of new believers.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:18.420]   And in doing so, I believe that what we might be doing is redefining church.
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.820]   Redefining church.
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:26.020]   We're going to be looking at the four legs on my stool so we're not sitting there balanced
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.660]   on one.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.900]   And we are going to be challenged.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:40.780]   Next week, we're going to look at what happens when we gather around God's Word.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:46.620]   Pastor James will be talking about what it is to have a Word-rooted church.
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:52.540]   We open chapter two with Pentecost, and then we heard Peter preach and 3,000 people repent
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.820]   and believe in Jesus.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:26:00.340]   But those who stay behind in Jerusalem and don't return to their homes in the countryside,
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.180]   they form the first church.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:10.660]   It's like they almost naturally come together to do what they are supposed to do to be a
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:18.660]   church and it starts around gathering around God's Word.
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:24.100]   They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:32.980]   Jerusalem was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:43.100]   Pastor James, who I know deeply loves the Word of God, will introduce us to someone
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:51.460]   who unites us despite our different ethnicities, our different backgrounds, our different movie
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.860]   and food and exercise preferences.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:05.740]   We will gather around Jesus and His Word.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:10.780]   The week after that, we're going to look at that they shared meals and took communion
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:17.500]   together as Pastor Johnny looks at a hospitality-driven church.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:23.500]   Food is a big deal for Pastor Johnny.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:28.400]   And food was a big deal for the first church plant.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.880]   They devoted themselves to the breaking of bread.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:37.280]   They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:43.320]   The early church would eat together and celebrate the Lord's Supper as part of the meal.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:50.100]   There was a continued time of fellowship focused around Christ and aided by food.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:57.220]   And as you heard earlier, we have got the best deal ever for you to have food after.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:01.900]   So what we're going to do after this sermon, Johnny, keep the sermon short, we're going
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:06.220]   to...after this sermon, we're going to go out and we're going to put this into practice
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.220]   downstairs.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:13.860]   The third thing, we pray together.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.940]   And on the 4th of June, Michelle is going to share with us about a prayer-centered church.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:23.920]   It says here they devoted themselves to prayer and to praising God.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:29.220]   In Acts, we found the early church praying together and worshiping God.
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:35.880]   Have you ever heard that they got church that prays together, stays together?
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.260]   We as a church have much to learn about prayer.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:46.620]   And I know Pastor Michelle has a special burden for this topic and is someone who practices,
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.060]   really practices what she preaches.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:54.780]   She will encourage us and challenge us at the same time.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.900]   And we're going to come back to doing life together.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:02.500]   And Pastor James is going to talk about what it is to be a community-based church.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:10.700]   He will remind us that Christianity is not just a Bible study, but it's a lifestyle.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.660]   They devoted themselves to fellowship.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:16.500]   All the believers were together and had everything in common.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.740]   They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who needed.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:25.860]   Every day, they continue to meet together in the temple courts.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:32.820]   And this is the week that we will look at the church that is not a building, not a place,
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.340]   but a fellowship.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.060]   People doing life together.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.220]   James is someone who practices what he preaches.
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.780]   I'm so looking forward to hearing this sermon.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.160]   So how do we do church together?
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.340]   We gather around God's Word.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.960]   We share meals and take communion.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:57.500]   We pray together and we do life together.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.180]   So what's the fruit of all this?
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.780]   What is the outcome?
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.740]   Well the result is we grow.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:11.380]   And on the 18th of June, I'm going to talk about what it is to be a kingdom-minded church.
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.720]   The last verse ends like this.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:21.380]   The Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:28.660]   The result of this church family studying scriptures together, doing life together,
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:34.060]   sharing meals and communion together, and praying together is there's something so unique,
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:42.700]   distinct, and wonderful about them that others can't fail to come to faith in Christ.
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.860]   It's not they don't evangelize and witness.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.660]   They do.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:53.860]   But how they live positively affects their witness.
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:58.340]   My friends, this is what I want to see for this church.
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.860]   Mark the next six Saturdays in.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.860]   Make sure you're here.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:06.020]   And on the 25th of May, we're going to have a surprise for you.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:15.200]   As we draw this all together, we're going to ask, what is church?
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:21.340]   As I ask the band to return, I'm going to make a declaration.
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.020]   It's not the way we normally finish the service.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:29.420]   I'm going to make a declaration.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:35.860]   On the 16th of March this year, at an event that was called The Tide is Turning, James
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:45.900]   and I were part of this, an event of Christians across Hong Kong, local, international, across
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:57.980]   denominations, I was invited to make a declaration on behalf of Hong Kong's 1,300 plus churches.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:07.900]   Other people made declarations on behalf of business, education, government, next generation,
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.220]   etc.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:16.020]   As we stood as one before our King.
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.620]   Tonight I'm going to make a similar declaration.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.420]   I'm going to ask you to stand in a moment.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:33.300]   I invite you to stand with me, say amen with me, and join us for the next six weeks as
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:39.100]   we investigate church together.
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.100]   Would you stand?
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:47.580]   If you feel comfortable closing your eyes, that's fine as well.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:50.220]   There's going to be nothing on the screen.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.660]   I want to read a verse from 2 Chronicles 7, 14.
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:53.660]   You know this one.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:59.220]   "If my people who are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:05.700]   and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.500]   and will heal their land."
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.140]   This is what I want to declare.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:21.300]   "We are the church that you have established, that you gave life to by your Holy Spirit.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:29.560]   But we have made the church to be things other than you intended.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:35.740]   We have been guilty of building our own kingdoms and not yours.
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:41.100]   We have worshipped the gifting of men rather than the one who has bestowed their gifting
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.660]   upon them.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:49.100]   We have exalted pastors, preachers, worship leaders, buildings.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:55.400]   We have worshipped at the altars of big numbers, big donors.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.060]   We have been divided.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:03.220]   Church fighting church, denomination fighting denomination.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:07.940]   We have placed our dogma ahead of relationships.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:14.540]   We have wandered far away from the church you intended us to be.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:22.820]   Father, we humble ourselves before you and choose today to repent of our sin, our pride,
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.820]   our worship of mammon.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:34.880]   We are sorry when our religious zeal has placed the law of Moses above the grace of Jesus.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:41.260]   We are sorry for inventing man-made rules to replace the work of your Spirit.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:49.140]   We are sorry of making church a building, a place to go to rather than a thing we are.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:55.780]   Our war is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities of this world.
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.600]   We bless you for our church communities.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.540]   We bless you for our church leaders.
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.080]   And we bless you for our brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:11.280]   We recognize the love of Christ and the Spirit in God in so much of our church.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:18.340]   Today we pray for healing, for those who have been hurt by our comments and our actions,
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:23.440]   for those we have rejected for doing things a different way or having a different style
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.160]   to ourselves.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:31.560]   We pray for a new awakening, fresh wind and fresh fire.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.960]   Renew your church from top to bottom.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.600]   Remove the judgmental spirit from me.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:44.560]   Free me from old habits and a spirit of religion and religiosity.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.400]   Help me to be an ambassador of reconciliation.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:54.040]   Give me a fresh love for your church and give me a servant heart.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:36:01.120]   I declare that the Church of Hong Kong shall become your church, a pure and spotless bride
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.200]   awaiting the return of its bridegroom.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:10.800]   I declare this is a new season, a new beginning, and the church will rise up to be the church
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   you ordained on the day of Pentecost.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.760]   I speak unity to the church.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:23.360]   I take authority in Jesus' name to any spirit that would seek to cause division.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:30.480]   I take an axe to the root of quarrelling, denominationalism and competition.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:40.760]   I declare there is only one church in Hong Kong, the Church of Jesus Christ, and that
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:45.600]   you, Lord Jesus, are its head.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.000]   I want to finish with some scripture.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.720]   This is Jesus' last prayer before he went to the cross.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.600]   My prayer is not for them alone.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:03.480]   I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:08.800]   may be one Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.940]   May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:21.400]   I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one, I
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:27.320]   in them and you in me, so that we may be brought to complete unity.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:39.320]   Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.520]   me.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.800]   Let's declare this in song.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:53.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
