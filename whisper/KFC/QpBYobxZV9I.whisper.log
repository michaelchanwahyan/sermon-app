[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   So good evening everyone.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.200]   Tonight we're going to start on a new series on the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.460]   Now the topic that we'll be discussing today is, is life worth living?
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.400]   Now as you all or some of you might know, I am pregnant.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.640]   I'll just show my tummy.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.640]   This is not eating too much potato chips for sure.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.760]   And so Philemon and I are expecting to have a baby in December and we're extremely excited
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.760]   about it.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.520]   For those of you who want to ask, do we know if it's a boy or a girl yet?
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:51.440]   The answer is not yet, but we will be in about 10 days time when we do another round of scanning.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.000]   Now I know that Pastor John really wanted me to do this, which is to hold my tummy and
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.080]   then ask, is life worth living?
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.600]   I mean he did mention that he can use his own belly, but I think it might mean something
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.440]   else if he did that.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.780]   So let's stick with me I think.
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.560]   So as a new life begins from a baby's first breath to the last one, there's a lot of things
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.040]   that happen, right?
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.760]   And in the Hong Kong context, what does that mean?
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.320]   It means that the parents will have to start looking for a hospital to give birth.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.920]   And then next thing you know, the child is born and he or she learns to walk and talk
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.400]   and learns to be cute.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.880]   Maybe that part they don't have to learn.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.960]   They're naturally born, right?
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.800]   And then of course you have to go through trying to line up for an interview to get
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.440]   into what?
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.560]   Kindergarten, okay?
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.000]   And then go through primary school trying to do all the exams so that you can get into
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.920]   good secondary school.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.920]   And then what?
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.040]   You might start dating if your parents allow you.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.040]   And if they don't, well you just kind of hide it from them and you still do it anyways,
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.040]   right?
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.720]   And then you go through college and then you might find a job that you like or it was encouraged
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.520]   by your parents to do it, right?
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.000]   And so eventually you might get yourself a house, a mortgage, and some of you decides
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.680]   to get married or some of you might not.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.960]   And that's kind of what we see, right?
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.600]   And then they might have kids and then we see that all over again.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.200]   And then that person may or may not get sick and then eventually what happens?
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.140]   They die.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.280]   And that is the story of life.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.120]   But there's also another story that we'll also see, right?
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.880]   There are people, for example, that are orphans to begin with or they might be born with a
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:00.280]   disability or they might actually develop a severe disease in which their lives would
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.300]   never be the same for them and also their families.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.400]   It's very difficult, right?
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.960]   And actually some other ones, they might start to be involved with drugs or involved with
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.480]   the wrong people that lead them to commit crimes.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.160]   And yet there are still others who might commit suicide because of a mental illness or things
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   that are happening in their lives.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:35.920]   So what we see is that rather it is the circle of life or unintended mishaps in life.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.280]   It begs the question, is life worth living?
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.760]   And so first off, what we're going to do today is that we are going to unfold Ecclesiastes
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.840]   little bit at a time.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.840]   And then so today I want to first give you some background about the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.920]   Now it is a piece of wisdom literature.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.200]   So it has a lot of wisdom.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.600]   That's what it means.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.440]   And then it's also written in a form of a poetry, which is very common in that time
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.280]   of King Solomon and also in the near East countries.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.960]   Now it's a very different books than all the other books, right?
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.640]   Because what we see is before that there is the story of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob about the
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.640]   Israelites and all of a sudden there's the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:36.640]   And it's really a story that's kind of observes life and then draws some conclusions.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.640]   So Ecclesiastes offer a rather dark and sometimes even depressing worldview.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:51.520]   Now fertility and emptiness seems to overwhelm what is joy and success, right?
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.040]   And life is unfair.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.440]   Work is pointless.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.560]   Nature fails to satisfy.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:07.480]   Good living and wise thinking seems to be futile because you, us, we're all going to
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.400]   die anyways.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.160]   And it suggests that only fearing God and preparing for judgment matters.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.360]   So we're going to unpack that throughout the next 11 weeks.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.200]   And these are the topics that we'll be going through.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.160]   So tonight is, is life worth living?
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.520]   And we're going to look at living in circles, disgusted with life, time and toil.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.200]   Life just isn't fair.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.680]   Stop thief.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.400]   Is life a dead end street?
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.760]   How to be better off?
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.080]   What about the wicked?
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.080]   Meaning so small here, meeting your last enemy.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.800]   A little folly is dangerous.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.900]   What is life all about?
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.720]   So we're just going to unpack that.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.920]   But today really would be answering the question, is life worth living?
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.320]   Now in the very first verse of this chapter, we see the words of the preacher, the son
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.260]   of David, King of Jerusalem.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.440]   So what we see is that the author right from the start introduces what he's about to say
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.640]   and is from this preacher.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.040]   Now the word preacher in Hebrew is kohelet.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.840]   It stems from this verb that means an assembly of people.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:31.240]   And in this case is an assembly of people that would come together to learn and to listen.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.680]   And the Greek is ecclesiaste, which is what we get from the English, the name of this
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.960]   book Ecclesiastes.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.480]   And the Greek word is ecclesia, which is what we see in the New Testament, that means church.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:56.440]   So it's a people of gathering to hear this wisdom preached by this preacher.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.680]   Now so many would identify, do you know who the author is of this book?
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.640]   Solomon, yes.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.960]   So many would actually identify the author to be Solomon because while it says that it
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.900]   is the son of David, right?
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.560]   And who would not be better than Solomon?
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:22.440]   But there are also other good reasons to believe that it might not be Solomon because it was
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.000]   never explicitly said.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.600]   I mean, son of David could be more than one and it can just be a way that the author introduces
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.940]   this preacher.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:38.040]   And at the same time, Solomon refers to a number of, sorry, the author introduces himself
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.120]   as I the king more than once.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:47.000]   But when he did that, it was in an era that was not quite in Solomon's time.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.440]   And also the Hebrew language that was used was actually not the time where Solomon was,
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.340]   but a bit later after that.
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:02.560]   So it suggests that it might not be Solomon, but it is debatable rather or not it is him.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.840]   But one thing that is more widely accepted is that the person who's writing it, the author
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:16.200]   actually adopts the personality of King Solomon and his point of view.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.580]   So it seems that there should be at least two roles, okay?
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:26.960]   There's one role of the author or the editor, and then there's the preacher who is examining
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.440]   the world and he's drawing some conclusion himself.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:38.800]   But at the same time, the author or the editor is also observing what this preacher is saying
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.080]   and drawing his own conclusions.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.680]   So we're sometimes going to see here two voices because of this.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.400]   It might be the same person, but we don't know for sure.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:58.340]   Now, so in verse three, the author says, "What does man gain by all the toil at which he
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.680]   toils under the sun?"
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.400]   Now this is a very good question.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.160]   What does man gain through all the works under the sun?
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.880]   But it seems to not answer it right at this moment.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.760]   But you notice, you know how sometimes we ask a question, it's almost like we've already
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.760]   given the answer, right?
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:24.720]   So and then it implicitly implies that actually no, there is no benefit of all the toils under
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   the sun.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.120]   Now when we talk about benefits or gain in this word, I want to highlight the word gain,
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.120]   okay?
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.400]   I mean, what do we think of?
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.800]   We think of jeckso, right?
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.680]   Jeckso, okay?
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.440]   And I think the people in Hong Kong are not foreign to it, okay?
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.960]   Is anybody who's here that doesn't want a good deal?
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.900]   We all want a good deal, right?
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:54.960]   So just a few days ago at 7/11, there was this great deal of their annual sale, 23%
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.560]   off, everything above $100, if you can read this.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:05.800]   And so being the kind of wanting jeckso people, right, on our way home, Falima and I decided,
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   you know what, maybe we'll pass by 7/11 just to have a look, see what kind of good deals
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.680]   we get, right?
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.320]   And so when we got off the bus, there were six people ahead of us.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.240]   And surprisingly enough, they were all heading to the 7/11 for what?
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.440]   Jeckso, right?
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.520]   And so recently we've been trying to fix up our air con as well at home.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:34.920]   So I've been calling places after places, over 10 for sure, to get a quote.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.920]   Why?
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.920]   Because I want to save a few hundred dollars, maybe over a thousand.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   So I mean, we're definitely not foreigners of this gain or jeckso, right?
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.120]   And I mean, that's why you choose your job anyways, hopefully.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.880]   I mean, if there were two jobs that gave you an offer, which one do you choose?
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.160]   The one that gave you more benefit.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:01.000]   If there were two people that you could be dating, which one would you choose?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.440]   The one that probably encourages you and loves you more, right?
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.320]   Not money wise, come on.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.240]   And then of course, we think about these things, don't we?
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.520]   I mean, who here's want to do all the work for nothing?
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.600]   Put up your hand, come on.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.720]   We'll hire you right away.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.620]   No one, right?
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:32.700]   So when we talk about gain, because this is what Ecclesiastes is saying, that what does
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.580]   man gain from all this toil?
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.420]   It's a good question.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.480]   What do we benefit from?
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:59.040]   Now it actually in verse two, the author tells us why it is that there is no gain.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:05.920]   I'm going back from verse three, back to verse two, because he says, "Vanity of vanities."
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.140]   The preacher says, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.800]   Now the Hebrew word is actually hebel.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:21.960]   It means that it's futile, lacking substance, profitless, and pointless.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.960]   The reason it asks the next question, what is the gain, is because he's already seen
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.320]   that there is no gain.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   It's all vanity.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:34.600]   And in its noun form, it means like vapor or wind.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.320]   So I want you to all hold out your hand right now, either hand.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:43.320]   Okay, now try to hold some air.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.320]   Can you do that?
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.240]   Are you holding?
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.240]   This is hebel.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.720]   Okay, you can put it down now.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.440]   You don't have to do it all night long, unless you really want it.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.440]   But this is hebel.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:01.760]   So every time we talk about this fertility, where this nothingness or this emptiness,
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.640]   something that we can't grasp and is fleeting away, because even if you have tried, you
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.640]   can't.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.400]   So a few days ago, Felima and I were watching the Grand Slam.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.160]   It was the Wimbledon's finals.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.800]   And we watched the women's final.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.760]   It was Elena Rebikina against Anjabub.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.800]   I can never really pronounce their name right.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.760]   But what we see is it was the final, and they were in the third set, and eventually, of
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.840]   course, not of course, but Rebikina won.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.160]   And so we were expecting all other champions, what did they do?
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:46.280]   They jump up and down, and some of them fall on their faces, and they're just like disbelief.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.200]   Oh my gosh, I won this, right?
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.360]   That's what we were expecting.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.160]   But interestingly, Rebikina did not respond like that.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.360]   She was as if she just made it into the preliminary.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.020]   She was like, "Okay, thank you."
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:07.040]   But even the commentators had to say, "Can someone please go down and tell her she just
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.840]   won the Wimbledon's final?"
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.280]   Okay, because it's like she's unaware of it.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:18.360]   And I just thought to myself, maybe she has got ecclesiastics nailed.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.480]   Maybe she's like, "It's all futile anyways.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.480]   I mean, Wimbledon finals, whatever.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.400]   Yeah, $2.5 million of something, I think.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.960]   It's okay."
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.820]   What does that mean?
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:40.400]   Of course, eventually during an interview, she did say she was too nervous to respond.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.560]   But what we actually see is that life is just temporal.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.980]   This is one of the main themes in ecclesiastics.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.980]   It's temporal.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.360]   It's just going to go away.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:57.920]   Rather you win this final or not, rather you achieve whatever status you want to have,
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.280]   however many kids you want, or gain however much you want.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:10.520]   Whether you're the CEO or the street cleaner, it really doesn't matter the moment you die.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:16.720]   And so this brings us to our first point, which is don't live for the temporal, but
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.920]   live for the eternal.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.320]   Now if we already know from the beginning that, well, if everything's temporal and all
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:32.960]   our happiness or sadness is going to go away anyways, why make a big fuss out of it?
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.160]   Of course, well, some people go to the other extreme.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.160]   Then you know what?
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.840]   Let's just all sit here and wait to die.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.400]   Okay, that doesn't benefit us either, does it?
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.180]   So you see, either we work and toil under the sun, that doesn't benefit.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.880]   No gain, no jacksoap.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.440]   Or we sit there and we wait to die.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.440]   There's no benefit in that either.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:11.120]   But what we see in the Bible is Matthew 16, 26, it says, "What good will it be for a man
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.000]   if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?"
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.440]   So it's an obvious comparison that even with all the riches, all the gains that we will
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:34.360]   have in this world, but if we lose our soul, there is no benefit, no jacksoap, it's hebel.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:39.280]   So instead we must live now, not for now then.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.960]   We must live now for the future.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.380]   Let me say that again.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.320]   We must not live now for now.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:56.520]   We must live now for the future.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:03.240]   It means that if we live for the temporal life, for money, fame, or whatever we want,
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.880]   we won't gain anything.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:12.640]   But if we live for the eternal, we will gain everything.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.820]   That is our soul, our eternal life.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:22.240]   And so we do know that from the rest of the Bible, that if we have accepted Jesus, if
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:30.360]   we have repented of our sins, and if we continue to faithfully follow him, then we will have
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:37.120]   our soul, our life, our eternal life, which is the most important thing.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:45.440]   Now if we go back to see Ecclesiastes chapter one, verse three, we see that.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.140]   Let's look clearly again at this question.
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:53.340]   I mean, I only got three verses to work with, so I'm going to look clearly into each one.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:18:00.100]   What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:06.500]   You know, we actually see the preacher saying under the sun 29 times in this book.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.780]   What do you think that signifies?
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.940]   It means that if our eyes, I mean, it doesn't mean that if we do it on a rainy day, then
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.500]   everything's different.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:26.380]   It just means that if we keep our eyes only in the temporal, then it's not going to benefit.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:35.140]   But imagine this, what does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the heavens?
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.820]   Now that would be very different.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:44.500]   You see, it's all a matter of whether God is in the equation or not.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.780]   That is Hebel or it's gain.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:57.220]   I want to share with you that Apostle Paul says in Philippians 121, "For to me, to live
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:04.140]   is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:08.340]   Life for Christian is Christ.
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:13.860]   To hold him at the center, to imitate him, to trust him, to follow him.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:19.460]   But there's actually any gain in our lives at all is actually lies in our death.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.620]   Lies in our death.
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:28.020]   And that's death in this current time where you die to yourself and is also death when
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.060]   you die at the very end of your life.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.580]   So this is no longer Hebel.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:39.980]   So you see, Christians are supposed to go after Jexo.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:47.220]   Actually, in fact, I would say we're the best at calculating the profits because we want
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.660]   eternal profits, not temporal ones.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.340]   I mean, of course we want both.
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.740]   Let's just put it that way, but we get eternal ones.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.740]   And so this is a lot of hope for us.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:03.860]   I mean, for some of you who might be going through a job that gives you a lot of anguish,
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:11.260]   maybe your coworker misunderstands you and your boss mistreats you and you think about
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:18.220]   the temporal, I want to say, you're half dead because your coworker might never understand
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.220]   you.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.900]   Your boss might never give you that promotion that you deserve.
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:30.140]   But if you live for eternal, what would that look like?
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:38.620]   What would you do in situations like that in light of eternity, in light of you being
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.960]   Christ?
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.380]   How would you treat your coworkers and how would you treat your boss?
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:50.320]   Your focus is no longer on their achievements or that promotion, but instead how to live
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.860]   out Christ.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:58.580]   And if you do that, according to Apostle Paul, to die is to gain.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.200]   And some of you might be going through a tough marriage or relationship.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.300]   How do you respond in light of eternity?
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:15.300]   Instead of stonewalling or arguing, would you react in a way that is in light of eternity?
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:20.540]   How do you respect more or love more in a way that honors God?
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.520]   As a student, you might be struggling with study or vice versa.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:29.460]   You're studying too much so that you just ignore everyone else or everything else.
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:35.820]   And so in light of eternity, what would you do?
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:43.620]   Now Stephen Curry, I hope that wakes up most of you, is an American professional basketball
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.460]   player for the Golden State Warrior.
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:53.260]   Now he's highly regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.660]   And he's most well known for his three point shooter.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.420]   It's almost like he can throw a ball at anywhere, still gets it in, right?
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.740]   And he's been named the most valuable player twice.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.740]   So now let's see him in a bit of action.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.740]   Timeout, decide not to use it.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.740]   Curry, way down to, bang, bang.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.740]   Oh, what a shot from Curry.
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.740]   Curry splits the defense behind the back, fires a three.
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.740]   Oh, he puts it in.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.740]   What a spectacular move.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.740]   Timeout, Curry again.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.740]   And Curry hits a three.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.740]   It is amazing what Steph Curry can do with a basketball.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:37.740]   All right, I know all of you want to watch a little bit more.
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.740]   But I thought I'd come back to this before I lose all of you.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:46.740]   So Curry has been outspoken about his Christian faith.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:52.740]   He spoke about his faith during the most valuable player speech by saying,
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.740]   "People should know who I represent and why I am who I am.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.740]   And that's because of my Lord and Savior."
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:10.740]   And he also said that, "I do a little sign on the court every time I make a shoot or a good pass.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.740]   And I pound my chest and point to the sky.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.740]   It symbolizes that I have a heart for God.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.740]   It's something that my mom and I came up with in college.
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:30.740]   And I do it every time I step on the floor as a reminder of who I'm playing for."
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.740]   Now, some of his Curry-1 basketball shoes--
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.740]   maybe some of you have it, or at least one person here should have it--
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:45.740]   is that there is a Lays loop that's scripted 4.13.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.740]   It is a reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4.13,
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.740]   which reads, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.740]   And Curry also has a tattoo of the 1 Corinthians 13.8,
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.740]   where it says, "Love never fails," in Hebrew.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.740]   Now, not only is he outspoken about his faith,
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:11.740]   but he actually displays it through his interaction with his teammates.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:18.740]   Now, other team members have said, "You know, Curry doesn't want any special treatment.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.740]   He doesn't ask for anything, even though he's such a great player,
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:27.740]   but he always passed the ball to other players whenever he could.
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.740]   And at the end of the game, he would always praise and honor them."
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:36.740]   Now, Steph Curry has definitely influenced many people and pointed them towards Jesus.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:44.740]   Now, this is a photo of my nephew, Owen, in a Curry jersey doing his homework.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.740]   I believe he's watching online right now in China.
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.740]   Hello, Owen.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.740]   This is a bit of high.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.740]   So I'm putting this up because it's cute, but also just to display
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:04.740]   that you can have immense influence on other people, just like Curry.
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:11.740]   Now, Curry said that it was actually his mom that led him and his siblings
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.740]   to have a relationship with God.
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:17.740]   And at the beginning of their faith, their mother actually took them to church
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.740]   every Wednesday and every Sunday.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:26.740]   And at the same time, her mom would hold this Bible study at 6.30 every day
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.740]   before school, at 6.30 every day before school,
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.740]   for all those parents that are hearing this.
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.740]   And he says that his mom would pass on to the message to him over and over again,
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:45.740]   Romans 8, 28, "And we know that all things work together for the good of those
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.740]   who love God and to those who are called according to his purpose."
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:54.740]   So he knew that everything he did was for God's purpose,
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:26:00.740]   and he would do it with all his effort and might.
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:07.740]   And so he also said that, "I love basketball because it gives me the opportunity
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.740]   to do good things for people and to point them towards the man
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.740]   who died for our sins on the cross."
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   And he also said, "I know I have a place in heaven waiting for me because of him,
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:31.740]   and that's something no earthly prize or trophy could ever top."
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:39.740]   Now, both lives of Curry and his mother exemplified someone
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:46.740]   who don't live for the temporal, who's living for eternal,
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:51.740]   who has put Christ at the center of their lives.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.740]   Rather being a basketball player, rather being a mother,
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:01.740]   they're giving it all for Jesus, for God.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.740]   To live is Christ.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:09.740]   To die is gain.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.740]   So today we go back to the question, "Is life worth living?"
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:20.740]   Well, the simple answer is, it is if you live for God,
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:26.740]   because you would have gained your soul and that you would receive eternal life
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:31.740]   and at the end be remembered by God and received from him,
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.740]   the best gain that you'll ever have.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:39.740]   But at the same time, it is all just vanity.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:45.740]   Toil under the sun if it's only under the sun,
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:51.740]   but if it's under heavens, then it is worth living.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.740]   And so we always have to make a decision to live for now,
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:00.740]   the temporal for yourself, or to live for the eternal and for God.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:06.740]   Now in a moment we'll be singing "Give Me Jesus" as a response song.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:13.740]   Now part of the lyrics go like this, "Give me Jesus, give me Jesus.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:18.740]   You can have all this world, but give me Jesus."
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.740]   And as you sing that song, I really want you to ponder on those words,
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:29.740]   because I want to say that, you know, these lyrics, they're romantic.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:33.740]   You can say it almost during a vow.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:38.740]   And it's almost, it sounds as spiritual as it gets.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:42.740]   But do you really only want Jesus?
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:48.740]   I mean, how much time do you spend pondering about him each day?
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.740]   And when you bump into a problem,
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:58.740]   do you think how is it that you can live in light of eternity?
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:03.740]   Or are you still trying to figure out this thing?
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.740]   And you see, if Curry can play basketball for God,
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:13.740]   and his mother can teach his kids to be faithful to God,
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:18.740]   then certainly for us, whether we are students right now,
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.740]   whether we are wife and husband,
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.740]   whether we are mother or father,
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.740]   or whether we are single, or whether it's grandma, grandpa,
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.740]   or whether we are in our profession that we are in,
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.740]   we can and we should be living for God.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.740]   And that is the gain that we will have.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:47.740]   So I'll ask the band to come up and play some background music for us.
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:53.740]   And I just wanted us to take a moment, like take a minute or so,
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:59.740]   where we get a chance to speak to God.
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:05.740]   If you felt like you haven't been living your life with God as the center,
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:12.740]   you haven't been looking into the eternal things, but the temporal ones,
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:18.740]   I invite you at this time to really repent.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.740]   Say to God, "Help me.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.740]   Help me to put you first.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.740]   Help me to keep my eyes on the eternal
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:34.740]   so that I might gain the most important thing in this world."
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.740]   So let's take a moment now, and I will do a rapid prayer
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.740]   before we sing the response song.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.740]   (Whispering)
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.740]   (Praying)
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.740]   (Praying)
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.740]   (Piano playing)
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.740]   (Piano playing)
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.740]   (Piano playing)
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.740]   (Piano playing)
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:39.740]   (Piano playing)
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:44.740]   (Piano playing)
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:50.740]   (Piano playing)
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.740]   (Piano playing)
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:32:03.740]   Dear Heavenly Father,
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:09.740]   we pray that we won't be superficial Christians.
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:15.740]   And I don't think you have that word in your Bible.
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:20.740]   Father, we repent.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:25.740]   There must be many times when we don't think about you,
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:30.740]   when we don't put you in the center of our lives,
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:39.740]   and we run as if all that matters is today.
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:45.740]   But we pray, Father, that your Holy Spirit continues to guide us,
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.740]   to mold us, to transform us,
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:56.740]   to look at what is the most important thing.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.740]   We don't want to go through life
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:04.740]   and then just realize it's hebel, futile.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.740]   We want to go through life,
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:13.740]   and in the end, know that we've gained,
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:20.740]   we've gained you, the most important person.
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.740]   So, Father, we lift up all our hearts to you.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:30.740]   It isn't easy, but we pray that even with the distractions in life,
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.740]   that our hearts would always turn towards you
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.740]   in all the situations that we face,
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.740]   in all the places that you place us, Father.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.740]   May you have all the honor and glory.
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.740]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
