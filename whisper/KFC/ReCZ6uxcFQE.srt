1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
 I want to ask, did anyone just come back from a trip?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,200
 Did anyone plan to go on a trip?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,000
 If you don't have money, I can't help you.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,200
 If you don't have money, I can't help you.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,000
 Don't ask the pastor for money.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,200
 If you don't have money, you can't travel.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,200
 I know Christmas is a holiday.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,200
 I know for some of us,

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,000
 especially my group of junior boys,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,600
 I know some of you are going to take exams after Christmas.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,800
 Is there anyone who is going to take exams in January?

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,200
 How do you feel? I want to ask you, friends who are going to take exams in January.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,400
 Christmas.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,200
 It's so quiet.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 It's like you're not at the front of the school to study.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,400
 For me, I'm happy during Christmas.

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
 Because I take exams and then take a holiday.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,800
 But when it comes to middle school, I take exams after Christmas.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,200
 Can you imagine what I do during Christmas?

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,000
 I study and study.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,600
 So, for some people, holiday is a happy time.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,400
 For others, holiday is not a happy time.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,000
 It's like they're having a hard time.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,600
 But after Christmas, there's a name.

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,000
 I'm not afraid of reading the wrong word.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,800
 So I won't embarrass myself by reading the wrong word.

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,800
 After Christmas, there's a calendar.

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,600
 We've mentioned this before.

29
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,200
 It's like a calendar.

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,800
 If you've been to a church,

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,400
 we have candles in the church.

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,000
 But not for people who are getting married.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,600
 Some of you may have seen it.

34
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,800
 What is a candle?

35
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,200
 It's a calendar.

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
 We wait for Jesus to come back

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,400
 and we pray for him to be resurrected.

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,800
 So, in the calendar of the church,

39
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,600
 the calendar of the church,

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,800
 what is it after Christmas?

41
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,200
 There's a day of manifestation.

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,000
 I don't know if you know this.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,600
 If you've been to Eastern Europe,

44
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,200
 I haven't been there.

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,000
 I'd like to go there.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,600
 If you've been to Eastern Europe,

47
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,400
 the Eastern Orthodox Church,

48
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,200
 their Christmas is not on this day.

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,800
 Sorry, it's not on December 25th.

50
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,200
 Does anyone know when it is?

51
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,800
 January 7th.

52
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,600
 Yes, January 7th.

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,600
 Or January 6th.

54
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
 This is the day of the main manifestation,

55
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,400
 the day of Jesus' manifestation.

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
 Of course, we use December 25th.

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
 But I think the common meaning is that Jesus is manifesting.

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,600
 But what happens after Jesus manifests?

59
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 Jesus is crucified on the cross.

60
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
 I think you've heard this story before.

61
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,200
 Some of you have heard this story before.

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
 It's not that the story is bad,

63
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
 but you're familiar with it.

64
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,600
 But today, I'd like to share

65
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,400
 some unremarkable Christmas clips.

66
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,800
 Maybe you've been to church for many years,

67
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,000
 and you've found some scriptures you've never seen.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,400
 Or you've never noticed the meaning of the scriptures.

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,600
 But when it comes to manifestation,

70
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,000
 Jesus' manifestation is like a baby.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
 I think it's normal.

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,200
 I don't know if you've ever thought about

73
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,600
 a story about the myth.

74
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,600
 Does anyone like to research about myth?

75
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
 Yes, there is.

76
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
 There's one.

77
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,800
 Maurice has.

78
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
 Why is everyone so quiet?

79
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,200
 I don't know if you've noticed,

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,000
 even in Japanese animation,

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,600
 there are many myth elements in the animation.

82
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,000
 I don't know if you know.

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,800
 In Japan, there is a religion called "Shinto".

84
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,400
 I'm not talking about the actual religion.

85
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,400
 But there are many myths in China

86
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,000
 about how the gods appear.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,600
 Does anyone know how the gods appear?

88
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,400
 Why is everyone so quiet?

89
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
 I thought you were watching...

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
 Okay, let me give you an example.

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Maybe you're not warmed up.

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Your brain is a bit cold.

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
 Maybe you're not warmed up.

94
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,200
 Okay, who is this?

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,000
 Oh, I can say it.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Why can I say it all of a sudden?

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,400
 I want to ask who this priest is.

98
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,200
 Yes, in the Hellion myth,

99
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,000
 I want to ask what his role is.

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
 No, not his role.

101
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,000
 I mean, what is his function in the myth?

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 What is his ability?

103
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
 Yes.

104
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,600
 Yes, so what is he?

105
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,400
 What is the god's image?

106
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
 What is the god's face?

107
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,200
 What is his superpower?

108
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
 What is his superpower?

109
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
 I don't know how to use this word.

110
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,200
 Lightning.

111
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
 Yes, thank you very much, Maurice.

112
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,800
 Lightning.

113
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,000
 Let me read the wiki.

114
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,200
 This is my answer to the wiki.

115
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
 It says,

116
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,600
 Zeus is the king of the Olympus Mountain.

117
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
 He is also the king of the universe.

118
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,400
 When he is in a good mood,

119
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,800
 the sun shines brightly on the sky.

120
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
 When he is in tears,

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 it will rain.

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,800
 It sounds like a god's story.

123
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
 He can disperse the dark clouds,

124
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
 and make the sky appear like a rainbow.

125
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
 He can also pile up the dark clouds

126
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
 and make strong winds in the air,

127
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,800
 so that the sky will be illuminated by lightning.

128
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,000
 This is my answer to the wiki.

129
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,800
 It sounds like a god's story.

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
 A thunderbolt can kill people.

131
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,400
 I don't know if anyone uses a computer

132
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,600
 to play the games of Greek mythology.

133
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,200
 But lightning is not only this.

134
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,000
 There is another one that you may be more familiar with.

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,600
 Can you guess who I am talking about?

136
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
 It's not the "Lightning and the Sky".

137
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,200
 Thank you.

138
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,400
 Thank you for your answer, but it's not the "Lightning and the Sky".

139
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,600
 It's related to thunder.

140
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
 It's the "Thunder God".

141
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I think you may be familiar with this one.

142
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,400
 Does anyone know what is the background of this?

143
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,600
 What is the setting?

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,400
 Yes, it's from Greek mythology.

145
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
 Wow, that was quick.

146
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,600
 Greek mythology.

147
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,400
 What is the god doing?

148
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,200
 What is the god's name?

149
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,000
 What is the god's name?

150
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I will read it out loud.

151
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 It's the "Thunder God" again.

152
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,600
 It sounds like me.

153
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
 It sounds like me.

154
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,000
 I don't know if you have ever thought about this.

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,400
 Maybe we are too familiar with Marvel.

156
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,400
 I guess no one has watched Marvel.

157
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,400
 It was over a few years ago.

158
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,800
 Some people have mentioned someone, but I don't know if you have watched it.

159
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,400
 I don't know if you have watched it or not.

160
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,800
 We watch Hollywood movies,

161
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
 or watch TV shows,

162
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,200
 or even cartoons.

163
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,200
 When we talk about the god, we often think about this kind of image.

164
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,000
 Of course, some of them are a bit controversial.

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,400
 But we often talk about the god's ability.

166
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,400
 The god we think of

167
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
 when we talk about salvation

168
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,200
 is like this.

169
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,600
 But I don't know if you have ever thought about

170
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
 how Jesus is written in the Bible.

171
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
 How is Jesus written in the Bible?

172
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,600
 Yes, it's in the Bible.

173
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
 We will answer that later.

174
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,000
 It's not obvious.

175
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,200
 How is Jesus written in the Bible?

176
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,000
 You should have heard this story when you were a kid.

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 How is Jesus written?

178
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,200
 You will find that there is no such thing.

179
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,600
 What's even funnier is that

180
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,000
 in the early church,

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 they made a lot of baby Jesus stories to make Jesus look more powerful.

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,800
 What does that mean?

183
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 I will just mention one.

184
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,400
 It means that a baby Jesus can jump from a building to the top of a building.

185
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,600
 Of course, this is a fake story.

186
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,200
 It's not in the Bible.

187
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,600
 Don't say that it's a fake story.

188
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,400
 There is no such thing.

189
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,000
 But you will find that Jesus doesn't have this.

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,200
 If we use the perspective of making videos,

191
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,000
 making Jesus' story may be a waste of money.

192
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
 If we make Jesus' story,

193
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,600
 I mean the story after Jesus' birth,

194
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,800
 if we make Jesus' story,

195
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,000
 it will be a waste of money.

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,600
 Because it's not obvious at all.

197
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,000
 Let's start with a passage from the Bible.

198
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,400
 I will not read too much.

199
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,600
 Some of the scriptures you may be familiar with,

200
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,800
 but some of them you may not.

201
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 Let's start with a passage.

202
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,200
 I will invite you to read it.

203
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,800
 I will read it in English this time.

204
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
 I will read it in Chinese later.

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,400
 English first.

206
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,800
 1, 2, 3

207
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.

208
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,400
 We have seen His glory, the glory of the One and Only Son,

209
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,200
 who came from the Father, full of grace and truth."

210
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
 What does it say in Chinese?

211
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,600
 It says, "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.

212
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,800
 We have seen His glory, the glory of the One and Only Son,

213
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,800
 the glory of the One and Only Son,

214
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,600
 I believe that the word "made flesh"

215
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
 is familiar to you if you are a mentor,

216
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400
 or a little bit of an explorer,

217
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,800
 or someone who has a name.

218
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,000
 You may be familiar with this word.

219
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,200
 "The Word became flesh" is a more ancient Chinese expression.

220
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,800
 If you use English, it is straightforward.

221
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,000
 "The Word became flesh"

222
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,200
 Let's think about Christmas a little bit.

223
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,600
 We usually think of a beautiful picture on Christmas.

224
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,400
 It is beautiful.

225
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,000
 Let's not even consider it an artwork.

226
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,200
 If you have seen the Christmas decorations at church last year,

227
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,600
 or at the mall,

228
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,000
 there are less decorations at the mall,

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,600
 but you may see something similar.

230
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,400
 You know, it is like Jesus.

231
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
 You may see something like this.

232
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,400
 Isn't it beautiful?

233
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
 There are angels.

234
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,400
 The Bible says that the angels are the reason for Christmas.

235
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,000
 This is what we usually think of on Christmas.

236
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,600
 But if we go back to 1 Kings 1,

237
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
 it is a short chapter.

238
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,200
 It is in 2 Kings 7.

239
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,000
 I want to ask where Jesus was born.

240
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 The place where Jesus was born is a place where the horses are released.

241
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 The place where Jesus was born is a place called a "horse room".

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,200
 I have never been to a horse room.

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,000
 I don't have money, so I have never been to a horse room.

244
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,200
 I found a picture of a horse room on the Internet.

245
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
 A more beautiful picture of a horse room.

246
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
 A horse room looks like this.

247
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,200
 This is more beautiful.

248
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,000
 But I want to ask if anyone has been to an animal park.

249
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
 What do animals look like?

250
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,400
 Does anyone think that the animals are very fragrant, beautiful,

251
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,800
 and smell good?

252
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,400
 Or smelly?

253
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,000
 Or do some people think that animals are more fragrant?

254
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,200
 I think people who have seen a red cat may feel more comfortable.

255
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,400
 But if you go to an animal park,

256
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,000
 you should know that animals are smelly.

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
 They have sounds.

258
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,800
 Animals will scream if there is a sound.

259
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,000
 The animals you saw earlier were very quiet.

260
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 I think the reality is that

261
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,200
 they may be screaming because of the sound of Jesus' cry.

262
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,200
 But if you imagine that animals are very noisy in an animal park.

263
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,800
 So we think about peace.

264
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,400
 But when I was preparing for this message,

265
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,600
 maybe that is not a matter of peace.

266
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,400
 Maybe that is a noisy thing.

267
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,200
 There are animals screaming.

268
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
 Let you choose.

269
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,400
 I think you were all born in a hospital.

270
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,200
 If you are not, let me know.

271
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
 Let you choose.

272
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,800
 Do you think it is better to be born in a hospital

273
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,400
 or in the middle of animals?

274
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,200
 Of course, today's health perspective is hospital.

275
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,800
 I won't ask you to be born in a horse room.

276
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,000
 This is Jesus.

277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,400
 You may have heard this story many times.

278
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,200
 But we rarely think about a real horse room.

279
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,600
 What is a real place for animals to be kept?

280
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,400
 If Jesus is really so powerful,

281
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,400
 why did he appear in this way?

282
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,200
 I just said that the gods are very visible.

283
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,800
 You can tell by looking at them.

284
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,000
 This is a monk.

285
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,600
 This is a goddess.

286
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,800
 But you look at the baby and say, "This is Jesus."

287
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,000
 Of course, we know that Jesus has a divine work.

288
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,400
 We believe that Jesus has many divine works.

289
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,000
 Of course, we know that the greatest divine works are death and resurrection.

290
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,400
 But before we talk about this, let's think about the Book of Ecclesiastes.

291
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,600
 We just read it.

292
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
 Let's read it in Chinese this time.

293
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,200
 1, 2, 3.

294
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,000
 "He came to the city of Jerusalem, and dwelt among us."

295
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,600
 "Filled with grace and truth, we have seen his glory."

296
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,600
 "He is the one who came from the Father, and is the glory of the Son."

297
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,000
 Jesus didn't come to play with the baby.

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,600
 The Bible says that he lives among us.

299
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
 What does "live among us" mean?

300
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,800
 Let's go back to the Bible.

301
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,800
 Let me use a Lego example to explain.

302
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,400
 We say, "He came to the city of Jerusalem, and dwelt among us."

303
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,600
 Has anyone played with Lego?

304
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
 Have you played with it when you were little?

305
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,600
 You have so few hands.

306
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,200
 You have some hands at home.

307
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,400
 Good thing you have one hand.

308
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,800
 I don't play with it much.

309
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,600
 I just build things.

310
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,800
 I don't play with little people.

311
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,600
 Right.

312
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,800
 I'll pretend you've never played with Lego.

313
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
 You should know what Lego is.

314
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,800
 Little people are cute, right?

315
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,200
 Imagine two days later.

316
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,400
 The first day of 2025.

317
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,800
 Imagine when you wake up.

318
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
 You've become a Lego.

319
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,600
 What do you think will happen?

320
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,400
 What changes will happen in your life after you become a Lego?

321
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
 I think there are benefits.

322
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,200
 You don't have to eat.

323
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,400
 You don't have to sleep.

324
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,000
 You won't be tired.

325
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,600
 But you can't do these actions.

326
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
 Can you do these actions?

327
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,200
 I want to ask, "What are these actions for?"

328
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
 I can do this.

329
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,400
 But can I do this?

330
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,800
 Can I run?

331
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,600
 I can walk.

332
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,200
 But I can't run.

333
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,000
 I shouldn't run.

334
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Of course, you can run when you watch Lego animation.

335
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,600
 But you can imagine a Lego.

336
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,000
 If I use Professor Karen's example,

337
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
 you become a horse.

338
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
 Even worse.

339
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,200
 Lego is still called "It hurts when you step on it."

340
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,400
 "It hurts when you step on it."

341
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
 "It's dead when you step on it."

342
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,600
 Thank you, Professor Karen, for giving me an example.

343
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,400
 I can think of this.

344
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,000
 Jesus became a human.

345
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 I don't dare to say the same thing.

346
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,400
 But at least there is something similar.

347
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,400
 He is not forced.

348
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,600
 He voluntarily enters this kind of restricted situation.

349
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
 How do I say this?

350
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,200
 I know there are some mentors who have children.

351
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
 I have some classmates and friends.

352
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,600
 My age group of friends has children.

353
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,800
 I want to share something with you.

354
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
 I know you are younger.

355
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,600
 But I heard from your parents.

356
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,200
 Babies drink milk at night.

357
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,800
 What is "milk at night"?

358
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
 It means drinking milk at night.

359
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,000
 Why is it like...

360
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,400
 It's not a deep word.

361
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,000
 It means drinking milk at night.

362
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,600
 So,

363
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,400
 babies are in this state.

364
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
 They don't care about your mood.

365
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,800
 They don't care about their parents' mood.

366
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,200
 They just drink milk when they want to.

367
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,000
 They don't care if you are sleeping or not.

368
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,400
 So, the most difficult thing for parents is

369
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,600
 to give babies milk at night.

370
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
 I have experienced this.

371
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,800
 I have experienced this in my life.

372
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,000
 Don't say you haven't.

373
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,600
 Don't tell me you haven't tried giving babies milk at night.

374
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,000
 If you have, ask your parents.

375
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
 See if you really haven't tried it.

376
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
 Babies are like this.

377
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,000
 Babies are a very fragile concept.

378
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,400
 They basically don't know how to speak.

379
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,400
 I said earlier that the Church creates stories.

380
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
 So, the stories they create

381
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,200
 are the stories Jesus would speak in his birth.

382
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
 You don't believe it, right?

383
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,000
 You don't believe it's a baby like this.

384
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,200
 It's not a magical baby.

385
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,000
 It's not like the magical babies in movies.

386
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,800
 At least, there is no such description in the Bible.

387
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,200
 The description in the Bible is that Jesus was born in this world in a very simple way.

388
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,600
 You might ask, why is that?

389
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,400
 Why don't we use the biblical description we mentioned earlier?

390
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
 We would believe it.

391
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,600
 Maybe the reason is that

392
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,400
 when he was born in this form,

393
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,600
 he would let us know

394
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,000
 the true fragility of our hearts,

395
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,800
 our weakness, and our struggles.

396
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,200
 Why do I say this?

397
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
 Let's look at a passage.

398
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
 Most of the time, you won't notice it after reading it.

399
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,000
 Let me ask you.

400
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,200
 Who are the characters in the Bible?

401
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,000
 Except Jesus.

402
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Yes, there are a few.

403
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Yes, there are a few.

404
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Actually, it's not three, but a few.

405
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And then?

406
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,600
 Why is it so fast?

407
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,400
 Let's pause.

408
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
 This is too fast.

409
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,600
 There are other people.

410
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,600
 I believe that's what he thought.

411
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
 So, let's ignore him.

412
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,200
 He's just a character in the Bible.

413
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,000
 But there is a person in the Bible.

414
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,400
 A king.

415
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
 I want to ask, what kind of person is King Herod?

416
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,600
 I heard someone say something.

417
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,800
 Yes, a king.

418
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
 What is a king?

419
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,000
 A leader.

420
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Let's use a Chinese example.

421
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 If you are studying Chinese,

422
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,800
 I know some people are forced to study Chinese.

423
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,400
 How do you start studying Chinese?

424
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,000
 In Chinese history, there are kings and feudal lords.

425
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 They are the ones who govern the land.

426
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,400
 King Herod is one of them.

427
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,000
 So, he's not a great person.

428
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 He's a relatively small king.

429
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 He has some abilities,

430
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,800
 but he's not that powerful.

431
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,400
 Historically, people don't like King Herod.

432
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
 They don't like him.

433
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,000
 They think he's useless and can't do anything.

434
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
 So, there is a technique in the Bible.

435
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 What is it?

436
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,400
 It says that when King Herod was alive,

437
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,000
 Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Judah.

438
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 There were a few philosophers and doctors from the East

439
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400
 who came to Jerusalem.

440
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,000
 They said, "When Jesus was born and became the King of Judah,

441
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 we saw his star rise,

442
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,600
 so we came to worship him."

443
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,000
 Don't say anything about the words in the Bible.

444
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,200
 I'm warning you. Don't say anything.

445
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,000
 What was King Herod's reaction?

446
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,600
 Was he very happy?

447
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,600
 Was he like, "Wow, that's great!"

448
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,000
 I see that he's very happy, so I'm telling you not to say anything.

449
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 At least you have some concept.

450
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,400
 But no.

451
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,800
 There was actually a person in the Bible.

452
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,000
 Actually, it wasn't this person.

453
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,600
 Later, I'll talk about it.

454
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,800
 It was a group of people.

455
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
 It wasn't the news of the star rising.

456
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,400
 They were very happy.

457
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,800
 No.

458
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,000
 King Herod heard this and was very anxious.

459
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,800
 The people of Jerusalem were also very anxious.

460
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,800
 I guess King Herod didn't have an exam.

461
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
 He wasn't afraid because he didn't have an exam

462
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,200
 so he was probably afraid.

463
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,800
 King Herod.

464
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,800
 The reason why the Bible says King Herod was afraid

465
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,600
 is because he heard people say,

466
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,800
 "There's a king of the Jews."

467
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,600
 The title of King Herod is "King of the Jews."

468
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,000
 So, you see Jesus.

469
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,800
 The Bible doesn't say that Jesus can speak.

470
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
 So Jesus didn't say that he was the king when he was born.

471
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,600
 No.

472
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,200
 Jesus was just born as a baby.

473
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
 But people at the time were like,

474
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,600
 "Is there a king?"

475
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,800
 They didn't know it was Jesus.

476
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,600
 If you look at the Bible,

477
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,000
 they didn't know it was Jesus.

478
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 They just knew that there was a star representing a king.

479
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
 A baby was born

480
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,600
 and it already made a king.

481
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,800
 I said a king of the Jews.

482
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,600
 He seemed to have some ability.

483
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
 But he was already anxious.

484
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,200
 So the reason wasn't because of the exam.

485
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,400
 The reason was definitely not because of the exam.

486
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,400
 The reason was probably because he discovered something.

487
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,200
 He didn't know if there was a person or something.

488
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,800
 That something was impacting his source of confidence.

489
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,400
 So, for the king of the Jews,

490
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,600
 this position was his source of confidence.

491
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
 Today, we're not kings.

492
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,000
 Obviously, we're not.

493
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,800
 But I believe some things are also the source of your confidence.

494
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,600
 Maybe you think you're very handsome.

495
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,000
 Or you think, "Please don't say it."

496
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Or you think, "You're very handsome."

497
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
 Sorry, I shouldn't say that.

498
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,000
 Or you think, "You're very handsome."

499
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,800
 Sorry, I'm just talking about boys.

500
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,000
 You don't say it even if you think you are.

501
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,800
 Maybe I'm not good at playing the piano.

502
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,400
 I'm not saying that.

503
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,000
 Maybe I'm not good at playing the piano.

504
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Maybe I know a lot of Bible.

505
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,200
 My GPA is very high.

506
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,200
 I got a score last time.

507
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,400
 We think about these things.

508
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
 Even if I'm not a king of the Jews,

509
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,000
 there are some things I think I value.

510
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,400
 This is me.

511
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,200
 But it's very normal.

512
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,800
 Because this is how our society defines us.

513
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,400
 For example, you see a pastor in church.

514
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,200
 Or you see a student in society.

515
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,600
 I'm a certain job.

516
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,800
 I have a certain status.

517
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
 Even my family.

518
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 I'm someone's son or daughter.

519
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,200
 It defines us.

520
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,000
 And when something happens

521
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 that affects us,

522
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,200
 we become...

523
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,000
 We become anxious and uneasy.

524
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,800
 What did King Heliu do back then?

525
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
 Have you read this passage?

526
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,600
 What did he do?

527
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
 Don't say that.

528
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,600
 What did he do?

529
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,400
 He called all the priests and religious teachers

530
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,200
 to ask them where the cross was.

531
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,400
 I won't talk about the rest.

532
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,200
 You can go back and read it.

533
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
 You can go back and read it.

534
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,800
 But what are these people?

535
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,200
 Except for us, the Bible students,

536
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,400
 we've been looking up

537
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,600
 to priests and religious teachers

538
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
 who always fight with Jesus.

539
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,200
 But if we use the concept of the time,

540
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
 why did he call them?

541
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,200
 Because they were walking AIs.

542
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,400
 I'm not using the concept of the time.

543
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,800
 They were walking AIs.

544
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,400
 Because they were very learned.

545
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,600
 They could tell him,

546
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
 "The Bible says this."

547
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
 "So it might be here."

548
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,000
 Today's concept...

549
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,800
 I know you might not ask pastors or parents.

550
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,000
 You should get your phone and ask,

551
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,800
 "What do you do?"

552
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,000
 "Do you know anything?"

553
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,200
 You wouldn't call us, right?

554
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,400
 You'd get your phone and Google it.

555
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,800
 Or I don't know if anyone is better

556
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,000
 at asking with an AI.

557
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 AI can do homework.

558
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
 You can ask it.

559
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,800
 But will it help us?

560
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,000
 I'm not telling you not to use it.

561
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 I sometimes use it to write letters.

562
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 I do that.

563
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,200
 But...

564
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
 for life's problems,

565
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,000
 for anxiety,

566
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 I said anxiety.

567
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 For these emotions,

568
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,600
 for these struggles,

569
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,200
 do you think asking AI will help?

570
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
 Yes. Who said yes?

571
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
 Okay, I'll talk to you later.

572
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,200
 I'll talk to you later.

573
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,800
 I'll pretend you have some problems.

574
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,600
 For example, I have a joke.

575
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,000
 One time, the toilet rack at my house was lost.

576
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,400
 I didn't know how to fix it.

577
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,200
 I searched for a way to fix it online.

578
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,800
 And I found it.

579
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
 I was relieved.

580
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
 I was not anxious.

581
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,200
 The toilet rack was fixed.

582
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
 But there are some things,

583
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,000
 even if I have knowledge,

584
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,600
 I can't solve.

585
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,000
 Has anyone ever robbed a toilet?

586
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,200
 Here.

587
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,800
 Yes. Thank you, brother.

588
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,600
 Thank you, brother.

589
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,200
 Thank you, brother.

590
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,400
 You raised your hand so honestly.

591
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,800
 Has anyone ever robbed a mask?

592
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,600
 I really had to search for it.

593
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,800
 Has anyone ever robbed a check-in bag?

594
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,000
 Has anyone ever robbed a check-in bag?

595
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,800
 You mean the check-in bag you used to do?

596
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,400
 I forgot.

597
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,200
 Did I spend too much time on it?

598
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,800
 It's okay.

599
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,000
 I remember.

600
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 I think there are some things

601
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 that we can't solve with our knowledge.

602
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Of course, I'm not saying knowledge is useless.

603
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,200
 If we don't have vaccines,

604
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
 if we don't have knowledge,

605
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,400
 our anxiety won't be solved

606
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,000
 if we don't have knowledge.

607
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,200
 I remember a friend of mine

608
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,800
 during the most serious period

609
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,400
 of the pandemic,

610
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,600
 he told me something.

611
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,600
 He said he watched the news every day.

612
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,400
 Guess what he watched.

613
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,600
 How many people died?

614
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,400
 It's true.

615
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
 But how many people died

616
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,600
 compared to how many people were infected?

617
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,400
 Why do you think?

618
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,200
 Ah, to see if there are any more.

619
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,400
 And?

620
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,800
 His logic is like this.

621
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,400
 The more people are infected, the more scared they are.

622
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,000
 The fewer people, the less scared they are.

623
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I don't know if I've thought about it.

624
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,800
 Maybe we're all small.

625
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,000
 But I guess...

626
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 I see you laughing.

627
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 I guess you've thought about it.

628
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,400
 Anxiety is not just...

629
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,400
 Anxiety is whether it's when we were small,

630
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,800
 or when we were adults.

631
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,600
 Even how many years of life experience we have.

632
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,000
 There are some things that I really can't solve.

633
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
 So we might think Hillary Clinton is bad.

634
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
 We think the legislators are bad.

635
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,200
 But from this perspective,

636
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,800
 they are anxious and anxious,

637
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 and they are scared.

638
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,200
 That's not unreasonable.

639
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,000
 There are things that are beyond my knowledge.

640
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Is it true that she came like this?

641
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,400
 How would I know?

642
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,200
 So...

643
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,600
 Jesus is using the baby's identity to tell you

644
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,400
 that he's not here to scare you.

645
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,200
 If Jesus came like a ghost,

646
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,000
 then I think it's very reasonable for Hillary to be scared.

647
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Think about it this way.

648
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,400
 A ghost suddenly appears at the door.

649
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,800
 You don't know what he's up to, right?

650
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,800
 But Jesus didn't come to the world like that.

651
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
 I've said this for a long time.

652
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,200
 Jesus came to the world as a baby.

653
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,600
 What does "baby" mean?

654
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
 It's a baby who doesn't know how to breastfeed,

655
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,400
 but someone else is breastfeeding him.

656
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,000
 Jesus didn't use violence,

657
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,200
 or a way to scare us to scare him.

658
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
 I don't know if you feel like you're being forced back into the church.

659
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
 Maybe you think so.

660
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,000
 I don't need you to say it.

661
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,200
 You don't need to raise your hand.

662
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
 But think about it.

663
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,000
 Jesus didn't force us to go back to church.

664
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,800
 He didn't force us to follow him.

665
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,800
 He used a very weak sign at the time.

666
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,000
 Even Jesus' death.

667
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,600
 We often say that the cross is a very humiliating sign.

668
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,800
 So Jesus' birth and death

669
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,200
 are all very weak.

670
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,800
 The baby is weak.

671
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,800
 How powerful is the cross?

672
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
 But the Bible gives us a reason.

673
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,200
 The Bible says

674
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,200
 Jesus did this because

675
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,200
 he wanted to show us our weaknesses.

676
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,000
 He was tested in all aspects,

677
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,800
 just like us,

678
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
 but he was not guilty.

679
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 This is the book of Hebrews.

680
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,200
 This is not the book of Psalms.

681
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,600
 This is the book of Hebrews.

682
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,200
 What does it mean?

683
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,200
 I'll give you an example.

684
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,800
 I didn't get a zero in my exam.

685
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,400
 If you really got a zero, tell me.

686
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,800
 I've always had a bad exam.

687
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,400
 Do you have any friends like this?

688
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,200
 How many points do you get?

689
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
 "Try harder next time. I'll get this."

690
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,000
 Do you have any friends like this?

691
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Or are you like this?

692
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 If you are, raise your hand.

693
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 If you are, raise your hand.

694
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,400
 I guess you want to hit him.

695
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,200
 At least someone like this.

696
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,400
 But if someone is worse than you,

697
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,200
 maybe he really didn't get a zero,

698
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,400
 but you got a zero, and he said,

699
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,000
 and he really said,

700
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,800
 "So I'm the same as you?"

701
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,000
 "So you're that bad?

702
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,200
 Let's try harder next time."

703
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
 Maybe you're a bit stubborn.

704
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,400
 At least you don't want to hit him.

705
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,400
 You don't want to hit him like you did just now.

706
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:35,000
 At least it's not like that.

707
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,200
 So Jesus chose to live his life

708
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,000
 as a baby, a normal person.

709
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 He didn't have no achievements. He did.

710
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Because he had to have achievements

711
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,200
 for us to know he was really that God.

712
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,400
 But in the Bible,

713
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,200
 he came to us like this

714
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,600
 hoping that we could be merciful,

715
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,400
 humble, and humble,

716
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,000
 and receive timely help.

717
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,800
 Jesus taught us to love our enemies.

718
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,400
 I know this is hard.

719
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,000
 I also think it's hard to master this.

720
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,400
 But Jesus was wronged and nailed to the cross.

721
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,400
 Unless you think Jesus should be nailed to the cross.

722
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,400
 Otherwise, he was wronged and hurt.

723
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,600
 But he said, "Love your enemies."

724
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,400
 Jesus said,

725
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
 "Those who bear heavy burdens

726
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,200
 will come to us,

727
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
 and I will give you rest."

728
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,400
 But you know Jesus sleeps, right?

729
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,600
 I want to ask, what did Jesus do when the storm came?

730
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,200
 He slept.

731
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,400
 Of course, I don't know if he was tired,

732
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,800
 but at least he slept.

733
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,400
 He slept.

734
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
 But only a person who sleeps

735
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,600
 can tell you, "Those who bear heavy burdens

736
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,400
 will come to me, and I will give you rest."

737
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,600
 I think this is more convincing.

738
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,600
 It's not like, "I don't need to sleep for hours."

739
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,000
 You wouldn't believe it if he told you that.

740
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,400
 The Bible records Jesus' time as a teenager.

741
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
 It doesn't say much,

742
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,800
 but if you look at the Old Testament,

743
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,800
 it's about his teenage years.

744
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
 Jesus had to eat,

745
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,200
 and rest,

746
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,000
 and was scolded.

747
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,800
 He had many failures.

748
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,200
 But he had to go through this.

749
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,400
 Because he wanted us to know,

750
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,800
 he understood us.

751
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
 He knew what compassion we needed,

752
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,200
 what grace we needed,

753
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,600
 what help we needed.

754
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,200
 Notice, it's "temporary help",

755
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,200
 not "instant help".

756
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,600
 I know the Old Testament is about "instant help",

757
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,800
 but I think "instant help" is more accurate.

758
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,600
 Because it's not, "Whenever I want, I'll help."

759
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
 He's not talking about "instant help".

760
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
 It's not, "I'll get 0 points in the exam,

761
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,400
 will I get 100 next time?"

762
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,600
 It's not "instant help".

763
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,600
 Jesus is giving us "instant help".

764
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,600
 In our time of need.

765
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,800
 If I can't relax my hands,

766
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
 if I'm holding on,

767
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,000
 I can't get this help.

768
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,200
 Like I said, the more we want to hold on,

769
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,200
 the more we can't solve our inner fear.

770
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,600
 I can only relax my hands,

771
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,600
 and I can understand what "instant help" is.

772
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,600
 Christmas.

773
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,000
 I know that holidays are fun,

774
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,800
 except for when you have to read.

775
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,000
 But I hope that Christmas,

776
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,600
 especially this year, is the last time we worship.

777
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,000
 I don't know how many Christmas you've spent.

778
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,600
 I don't know how you think of Christmas,

779
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,200
 or how you think of Jesus.

780
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,400
 But I hope that we have the opportunity to think about

781
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,800
 the story of Christmas,

782
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
 if I may use this word.

783
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,000
 He's not talking about a god like Zeus,

784
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 playing with us.

785
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,600
 He's not playing with us like we're a game.

786
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,000
 If you look at the story,

787
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,800
 there are a lot of gods like this.

788
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,200
 I think the only one we believe in is Jesus.

789
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,000
 He's not a god like this.

790
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,400
 He's a god who turned into a goldfish,

791
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,200
 and can be eaten by anyone.

792
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,200
 If I may say so.

793
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,800
 He's willing to

794
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:16,000
 share everything that we've experienced in life.

795
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,400
 Today's response is a bit special.

796
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,600
 I'd like to invite the audience to sing a response poem.

797
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
 But while you're singing,

798
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,800
 I'd like to ask you to lower your heads.

799
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,400
 Please close your eyes.
