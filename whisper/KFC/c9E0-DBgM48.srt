1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
 - Heavenly Father, we thank you for this time

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,000
 that we can read your word,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,900
 that we can meditate on it and understand it.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,500
 And I ask that Lord, your Holy Spirit would empower me now

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,400
 as I preach your word,

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,700
 that Lord, it may not be my words,

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,700
 but it would be your words, Father,

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,700
 that you would soften our hearts to receive your word now.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,200
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,700
 All right, good evening, everybody.

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,500
 Hope you're doing well.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,500
 And we finished 1 Timothy,

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,300
 and now we are on to 2 Timothy.

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,000
 And in 1 Timothy, Paul charged Timothy,

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,800
 who was a pastor, a young and upcoming pastor,

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,200
 to uphold the truth, to pray, to lead, to serve,

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,200
 to love others, and also to fight the good fight of faith.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,500
 And now he starts off his second letter.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,000
 And once again, he introduces himself, right?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Paul, he's an apostle who he's talking to, to Timothy.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 He treats him like a dear son, right?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And he blesses him with grace and mercy and peace from God.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Paul is actually writing from jail in this second time.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Has anybody been to Rome?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I know you have.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 This is the second time.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Has anybody been to Rome before?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,500
 Anybody been to Rome before?

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
 Has anybody been to the Roman Forum there?

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,300
 Right around the Roman Forum is the prison

31
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,800
 that they believe Paul was imprisoned

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,000
 in his second imprisonment in Rome.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
 And you can see it's a dark cave.

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,100
 It's not a nice place to live.

35
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,100
 It's kind of roomy actually for Hong Kong.

36
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,100
 But I still wouldn't rent it probably.

37
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,100
 Not enough light, I think.

38
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,500
 Although when you go visit it now,

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,200
 it's nicely lit up for you as you visit it.

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,200
 Paul was in his last days, before he was to be executed,

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,200
 before he was to be judged in Rome.

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,700
 And this was the condition he was living in.

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,700
 A dark, moist hole where food was dropped down to him.

44
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,100
 And where was Timothy?

45
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,400
 He was writing to Timothy and Timothy was in Ephesus

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
 as you see in the next picture.

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,100
 Ephesus was the New York of that day, right?

48
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,100
 That's where all the craziest,

49
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,600
 brightest things were happening at that time.

50
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,700
 Ephesus was the New York of those times.

51
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,800
 And so Paul is writing to Timothy.

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,900
 And how do you usually start off a letter?

53
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,100
 Or how do you usually start off an email?

54
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,800
 How do you guys usually start off?

55
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,100
 Hi, how's it going?

56
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,400
 It was really good seeing you last time.

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
 Thank you, Albert, for coming today.

58
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,300
 Yeah, Albert's waving.

59
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,000
 Paul does the same thing.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 He's like, hey, I wanna thank several things

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,200
 before I get started in this letter.

62
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,400
 And he says, I thank you firstly,

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,900
 for God whom I serve as my ancestors did.

64
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,000
 And so he's thankful for the Israelites

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,400
 that God had called them to be his people.

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,700
 The second thing he is thankful for

67
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,800
 is his personal relationship with Timothy.

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,200
 In verse four, he says he recalls the tears

69
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,100
 that Timothy had.

70
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,000
 I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 They had a very close, deep, personal relationship.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,400
 And the third thing that Paul is thankful for

73
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,900
 is the faith that Timothy had.

74
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,400
 And this faith was actually passed down

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,400
 from his grandmother to his mother, and now to him.

76
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,100
 And some of us were at Joe and Alex's wedding

77
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,800
 on Monday, and one of the great things

78
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
 that we remembered was Joe's father.

79
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,200
 He was a great man of faith,

80
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 and that faith was passed on to James and Joseph.

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,600
 And they were able to celebrate that,

82
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,400
 that faith on that wedding day as well.

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,900
 And so now Paul goes into the heart of his letter,

84
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,400
 or the first part of his letter,

85
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,700
 and he says to guard, "Timothy, guard several things.

86
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,300
 The first thing is guard the physical gifts

87
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,100
 that the Spirit has given you.

88
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
 Guard your emotions.

89
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,800
 Guard the spiritual truth that I've passed down to you

90
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,700
 in the gospel.

91
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,700
 Guard your commitment.

92
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,700
 Stand guard."

93
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,300
 And when I think about guard,

94
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,800
 I really like to think about those guards

95
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,200
 that stand outside the Queen's Palace.

96
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,400
 Has anybody been there before?

97
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,500
 So, yeah?

98
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,300
 Has anybody taken selfies with those guards before?

99
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,000
 Michelle has.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It's amazing, right?

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Michelle takes all sort of selfies with them,

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,700
 makes funny faces, and what do they do?

103
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,700
 Do they make faces as well?

104
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,600
 No, they are stone-faced.

105
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,200
 They, I don't know, look at something.

106
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,900
 I don't know what they're looking at.

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,100
 Stone-faced.

108
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,000
 They're emotionally blank, it seems,

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 or focused, emotionally focused, mentally focused,

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,400
 committed to their, do their job

111
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,200
 of guarding the Queen's Palace.

112
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,300
 Although I watched that Netflix show,

113
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,200
 and it showed that somebody jumped the fence

114
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 and stole something, right?

115
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,000
 So, I don't know.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,300
 Maybe at night, they're not on guard.

117
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,700
 I don't know.

118
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,200
 But Paul tells Timothy to also stand guard.

119
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,500
 And the first thing he tells them to stand guard

120
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,400
 is as we read in verse six,

121
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,000
 "For this reason, because of your faith,

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,500
 "I remind you to fan into flame

123
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,000
 "the gift of God, which is in you

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,800
 "through the laying of hands."

125
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,600
 Fan into flame, the gift that has been given to you,

126
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,100
 the spiritual gifts that have been in you.

127
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,500
 Another translation is stir up, fan into flame.

128
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,800
 Who knows how to start a fire?

129
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,000
 Who knows how to start a fire?

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
 Paul knows how to start a fire?

131
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,100
 Okay, Paul, how do you start a fire?

132
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
 The traditional way.

133
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,500
 - Well, you can get some lint and spark,

134
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,300
 or just use a lighter.

135
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,200
 - Traditional way.

136
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,700
 - Traditional way.

137
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,500
 - Oh, just rub some sticks together.

138
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,200
 - Right, rub sticks together.

139
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,900
 And then what else do you do afterwards?

140
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,200
 - Rub more sticks together.

141
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,600
 - Right, okay.

142
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,300
 All right, rub more sticks together.

143
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,700
 And then eventually, there's a spark.

144
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,100
 And then Michelle's doing this,

145
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,500
 and it's not 'cause Philemon's beside him.

146
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,300
 And he's smelling, I'm joking.

147
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,200
 But you gotta fan into flame, right?

148
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,000
 Fan into flame.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
 There's this combustion that happens

150
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,900
 between oxygen and this spark that happens.

151
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,500
 What happens when you're doing your barbecue?

152
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,600
 You know, Hong Kong people love those barbecues.

153
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,300
 And you leave the coal.

154
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,400
 What happens to it?

155
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,400
 Does it get eventually brighter and brighter?

156
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,700
 No, it starts to die.

157
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,700
 It starts to die down.

158
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,200
 And Paul is telling Timothy here,

159
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,100
 the gifts that you've been given,

160
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,900
 don't just stay, you know, and don't use them.

161
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,200
 Don't be passive and sit on the couch.

162
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,100
 He's saying fan into fame.

163
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,700
 Stir up, be active, not passive.

164
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,700
 The gifts, the spiritual gifts that you've been given,

165
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,000
 fan into flame.

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,300
 I'm reminded of that parable, that story that Jesus told,

167
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,900
 the parable of the talents.

168
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,900
 The master was gonna go away on a trip,

169
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,600
 maybe a staycation, all right?

170
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,100
 And on the staycation, he was like,

171
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,100
 "Oh, I should entrust my wealth to some of my servants."

172
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,900
 And to one he gave, how much?

173
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,800
 10, oh no, see, tricked you, five.

174
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,100
 To the other he gave, two.

175
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,200
 And to one, to the other one, he gave one,

176
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,600
 according to their ability, right?

177
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,000
 As the scripture says.

178
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,600
 And most people who have gifts or who have wealth,

179
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 they start to invest it.

180
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,400
 And so do the ones that have been trusted with two

181
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,800
 and the one with four or five.

182
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,500
 And what happens is they multiply.

183
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
 They double what they've made.

184
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,100
 But there's one servant here,

185
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,400
 the one that's been trusted with one.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,400
 And Jesus says, what was his emotion?

187
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,700
 He was afraid.

188
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,100
 And so what did he do?

189
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,100
 He dug up a hole and hid his talent.

190
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,000
 He hid his talent.

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,900
 And Paul is telling Timothy here,

192
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,000
 "Be like those servants who've been entrusted

193
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,400
 "with money, with talent, and multiply it."

194
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,600
 Stir up those gifts, use them.

195
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,400
 Fan into flame those gifts.

196
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,700
 Anybody grow up in Canada here?

197
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,100
 Canadian, Canadia, a couple people.

198
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,600
 In Canada, there's two main languages.

199
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,440
 Do you know what?

200
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,300
 It's not Chinese, Cantonese.

201
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,100
 (audience laughing)

202
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,800
 It's French, en Francais.

203
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,300
 Bonjour, ça va bien?

204
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:24,000
 Okay, Albert is slightly recalling those years.

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,900
 In Canada, you have to learn French

206
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,600
 because it's also the other official language.

207
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,400
 And I learned it from grade one to grade 10.

208
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,600
 I actually took it in grade 10 as well.

209
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,800
 So imagine spending probably, I don't know,

210
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,400
 an hour, an hour and a half, five days a week

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,700
 learning that for 10 years.

212
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,100
 You should say, "Well, Johnny,

213
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,300
 "your French should be amazing, right?

214
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,900
 "You should like, it should be better than your Cantonese."

215
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,500
 I actually don't remember any French.

216
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,000
 (audience laughing)

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,600
 I mean, Michelle could barely recount the numbers, right?

218
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,500
 (speaking in foreign language)

219
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,700
 She knows one, two, three.

220
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,900
 (audience laughing)

221
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,000
 What happens when we don't use our gifts?

222
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,700
 We lose it, we lose it.

223
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,300
 And my French is bad,

224
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,000
 even though I spent all those hours learning.

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,300
 And if we don't use the spiritual gifts

226
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,300
 that we've been given, we may lose it as well.

227
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,500
 And so Paul tells Timothy,

228
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,200
 "Fan into flame the gifts that you have

229
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,900
 "that's in you with the laying of hands."

230
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,000
 The laying of hands, it shows community,

231
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,400
 the body of Christ working together.

232
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,300
 It shows dedication as we anoint our pastors,

233
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,900
 our reverends to serve.

234
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,700
 The second thing that Paul tells Timothy

235
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,600
 as we continue in verse seven,

236
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,300
 "For the spirit God gave us does not make us timid,

237
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:19,300
 "but gives us power, love, and self-discipline."

238
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,600
 In other translations, it says,

239
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,500
 "God's spirit doesn't make you afraid of people."

240
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:34,400
 So this sort of tells us that possibly Timothy was timid.

241
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,300
 He was maybe a bit shy or a bit laid back.

242
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:46,200
 Maybe he was a normal, a person of normal courage,

243
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,300
 but he had so much work to cover, so much work to do, right?

244
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,400
 Sometimes ministry can be overwhelming.

245
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,100
 Maybe it might not have been just this church in Ephesus,

246
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
 but a lot of churches surrounding him.

247
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,300
 So he was overwhelmed.

248
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,300
 And so Paul is telling Timothy,

249
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,100
 "Don't be timid, don't be afraid,

250
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,600
 "don't be fearful,

251
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:14,400
 "because the Holy Spirit gives us power,

252
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,500
 "love, and self-discipline."

253
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,800
 We need discernment.

254
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,500
 We need discernment.

255
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,000
 Because sometimes we're afraid of things

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,600
 that God isn't telling us to be afraid of.

257
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,300
 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, right?

258
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,900
 But sometimes we fear things that we shouldn't be fearing.

259
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:48,500
 And these fears, they start to disable us, hinder us.

260
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,400
 Maybe we're afraid to start a ministry

261
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,900
 because we think, "Oh, we don't know if anybody will come."

262
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,100
 Sometimes we do that, right?

263
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,300
 Like, "Oh, should we start a ministry?

264
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,300
 "Like, oh, should we start Alpha this season?

265
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,000
 "Because we don't know if anybody's gonna sign up.

266
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,500
 "What if nobody signs up?

267
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,900
 "Then it's just me doing Alpha by myself

268
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,400
 "with my helpers, the three of us.

269
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,340
 "Should we start it?

270
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,900
 "I don't know, I'm afraid.

271
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,700
 "Maybe, oh, I'm afraid to serve

272
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,700
 "because, oh, I don't know if I'm good enough.

273
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,400
 "Maybe I don't wanna serve

274
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,600
 "because, oh, I don't know what other people will think of me.

275
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,800
 "What if I do a bad job

276
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,500
 "and people will look differently upon me

277
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,900
 "and look down on me?"

278
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:45,400
 Sometimes fears hold us back.

279
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,400
 Fears hold us back.

280
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,800
 And Paul is telling Timothy, "Do not be afraid

281
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,500
 "because the Holy Spirit gives us power."

282
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,100
 The power to save lives,

283
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,700
 the power to serve Him with His gifts,

284
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,700
 the power to love people.

285
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
 That is the central aim of ministry,

286
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,500
 to love people, to love God and His people.

287
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,700
 God also gave us the Holy Spirit

288
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:27,200
 for sound mind or self-discipline, as it says.

289
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,100
 Fear or distraction can take control of our ministry.

290
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,100
 That God's Spirit imparts steadiness, steadiness.

291
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,500
 So are we paralyzed by fear

292
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,000
 or are we courageous in faith?

293
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,500
 Are we paralyzed by fear or are we courageous in faith?

294
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,200
 One of the summer activities that we did

295
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,800
 in the Titus Fellowship

296
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,700
 was we went bouldering, indoor bouldering.

297
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,800
 Anybody been indoor bouldering before?

298
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,700
 It's quite popular nowadays.

299
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,600
 So you climb up and then there's these like really soft mats

300
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,500
 and you can just jump down or whatnot, right?

301
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,000
 Or down climb and then jump when it's a safe distance.

302
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,100
 But as some people climb higher and higher,

303
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,600
 they start to possibly be afraid, afraid of heights.

304
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
 And when they're afraid of heights, what happens?

305
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,200
 They start to panic and maybe they'll jump down

306
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,800
 or maybe they won't be able to climb the rest of the route.

307
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,200
 Fear paralyzes them,

308
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,300
 prevents them from doing what they can do.

309
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,500
 Are we paralyzed by fear

310
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,600
 or are we courageous in faith as we depend on His Spirit?

311
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
 The third thing that Paul tells Timothy

312
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
 as we read in verse eight here

313
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,200
 is that do not be ashamed of the gospel

314
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,200
 or the testimony about our Lord or of me, His prisoner.

315
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,400
 Rather, join me in suffering for the gospel

316
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,300
 by the power of God.

317
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,900
 He has saved us and called us to a holy life.

318
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,800
 The third thing that Paul tells Timothy to guard

319
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,600
 is the gospel, the spiritual truth.

320
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,800
 Don't be ashamed of the gospel.

321
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,100
 And Paul certainly wasn't ashamed, right?

322
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,700
 He was willing to go wherever God told him,

323
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,200
 even when it meant trial,

324
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,800
 even when it meant imprisonment.

325
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,500
 He was not ashamed.

326
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,000
 And he went so far as to say to Timothy here,

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,500
 "Join me in suffering.

328
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,500
 Join me in suffering for the gospel."

329
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,900
 And Paul's reasoning is this.

330
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,100
 It's because this gospel has saved us

331
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,300
 as we see in the next slide.

332
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,400
 Paul's reasoning is that this gospel

333
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,600
 has called us to a holy life

334
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
 and it has given us grace.

335
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,100
 And this grace came with the appearing of Jesus Christ

336
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,600
 which destroyed death and sin

337
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,300
 and has brought life, an eternal life.

338
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,300
 And that is why Paul is a preacher.

339
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,600
 He's preaching this gospel so fervently.

340
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,100
 That is why he's an apostle.

341
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,000
 An apostle is one that is called to go

342
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,600
 and take the gospel where it is not.

343
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,300
 An apostle is one that writes the word of God,

344
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,400
 has been given that gift.

345
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,100
 He's a teacher of the gospel as well.

346
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:59,700
 And Paul tells Timothy here

347
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,600
 to hold fast, to keep the gospel,

348
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,100
 hold fast to it

349
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,200
 because it is sound teaching.

350
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,100
 It is reasonable.

351
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,400
 It is truthful.

352
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,200
 And you hold fast to it.

353
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,200
 And as you hold fast to it,

354
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,300
 your faith is revealed

355
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,300
 and the love of Christ is revealed.

356
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,800
 As we see in the next slide here,

357
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,900
 guarding the gospel truth

358
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,700
 reflects our faith and love.

359
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,700
 As we guard the truth of God in our lives,

360
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,600
 we automatically reveal our faith.

361
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,500
 Automatically we reveal the love of God.

362
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 As we go about standing up for the truth,

363
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,600
 we can't help but show the faith that we have

364
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,600
 in what God has done for us and to love others around us.

365
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,200
 Okay, the last thing that Paul tells Timothy in verse 14

366
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,600
 is to guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you.

367
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,600
 Guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.

368
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,800
 So Paul spent a lot of verses saying, guard the truth.

369
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,100
 The truth is so important

370
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,200
 because there were so many false teachers

371
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,600
 and so many false prophets, right?

372
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,400
 The truth is so important.

373
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,000
 How we are saved.

374
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,400
 It's not by works.

375
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,300
 It's through faith.

376
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,300
 And the last thing that Paul tells Timothy

377
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,300
 is to guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you.

378
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,600
 Now, what is this good deposit?

379
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,800
 What is this good deposit?

380
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,400
 Well, in other translations,

381
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,800
 the New Living Translation,

382
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
 it says through the power of the Holy Spirit

383
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,200
 who lives within us, carefully guard the precious truth

384
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,600
 that has been entrusted to you.

385
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,600
 So it could be continuing what Paul has been already saying.

386
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,000
 He's saying, guard the truth.

387
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,700
 And he's saying, before he was saying, keep the truth.

388
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,000
 And now he's saying, guard the truth as well.

389
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,600
 Other people could think it is possibly the Holy Spirit,

390
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,840
 right?

391
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,840
 In Ephesians, he says he put his spirit in our hearts

392
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,040
 as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come.

393
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,540
 All right, this deposit is our passport to heaven.

394
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,540
 Could be the Holy Spirit.

395
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,040
 In other translations, the New King James Version,

396
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,740
 it says this, the good thing which was committed to you,

397
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,440
 keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.

398
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,340
 Or another translation says, guard the treasure

399
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,340
 that is entrusted to you with the help of the Holy Spirit.

400
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,040
 All right, let's have a wager here.

401
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,540
 What do you guys think it is?

402
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,240
 Who thinks it's the truth, the good deposit?

403
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,060
 Anybody?

404
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,960
 The truth?

405
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,340
 Okay, Florence, maybe Vincent.

406
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,400
 Oh, Bonnie thinks it's the truth.

407
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,540
 Yeah, okay.

408
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,440
 All right, more takers.

409
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,840
 Who thinks it's the Holy Spirit?

410
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,000
 Anybody?

411
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,840
 Anybody?

412
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,040
 Okay.

413
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,160
 Michelle, Albert.

414
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,460
 Okay, four, five.

415
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,240
 Okay, six.

416
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,640
 Holy Spirit.

417
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,640
 Who thinks this good thing possibly is the ministry

418
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:54,400
 or this treasure, this ministry that God has given Timothy?

419
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,340
 Anybody?

420
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,240
 Any takers?

421
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,940
 Ministry?

422
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,700
 No, no takers?

423
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,100
 Okay, who has no idea?

424
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,940
 Raise your hand.

425
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,760
 Who has no idea?

426
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,240
 No idea?

427
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,060
 Okay.

428
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,960
 Okay, and the last option.

429
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,440
 Who thinks it could be all of the above?

430
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,200
 Okay, Paul just like totally raises his hand

431
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,100
 like he won the lottery or something.

432
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,740
 (laughing)

433
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,560
 Me.

434
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:27,740
 I possibly think it might be all of the above.

435
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,600
 Paul is telling Timothy,

436
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,100
 the thing that you've been entrusted,

437
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:40,200
 what has Timothy been entrusted with?

438
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,800
 He's been entrusted with the truth,

439
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,800
 the pass on the truth, absolutely.

440
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,900
 He's been entrusted with the church

441
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,560
 that he's been given to pastor that church,

442
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,200
 with the congregation he is to serve.

443
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,460
 And he has been blessed with the Holy Spirit.

444
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,260
 That empowers him, that teaches him to counsel him.

445
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:09,700
 In the parable of the talents,

446
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,700
 Paul, just like how this master is saying,

447
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,260
 he entrusts his servants with precious things, right?

448
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,060
 Not garbage things.

449
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,260
 He's entrusting him with significant things.

450
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,100
 These talents are worth a lot.

451
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,500
 They mean a lot to the master.

452
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:39,100
 And I think likewise, Paul is saying to Timothy,

453
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,260
 God has entrusted you with so much.

454
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:50,300
 With the truth, with your ministry, with your church.

455
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,260
 He's given you the Holy Spirit.

456
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,700
 And so you must guard those things

457
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,700
 with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.

458
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:10,500
 And so Paul, to recap, Paul is telling Timothy

459
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 to firstly guard the physical, spiritual gifts

460
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,800
 that he's been given.

461
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,460
 Paul is telling him to guard his emotions.

462
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,260
 It's easy to be overcome by fear.

463
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,660
 But overcome fear through the Holy Spirit,

464
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,100
 the spirit of power, love, and self-discipline.

465
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,820
 We need to guard spiritual truth.

466
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,300
 'Cause in those days, there were so many false prophets.

467
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,500
 And today we also have many false prophets.

468
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,460
 We must also guard the truth.

469
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,500
 And lastly, Paul is telling Timothy

470
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,100
 to guard the things that have been committed to him.

471
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:02,900
 The truth, his church, the people he's mentoring,

472
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,500
 guard those things.

473
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,100
 And so here is some application.

474
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,100
 Paul tells Timothy to guard his spiritual truths.

475
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,900
 Are we using our spiritual gifts?

476
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,100
 Are we using our spiritual gifts?

477
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,500
 Or are we hiding it?

478
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
 Are we hiding it?

479
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,820
 Are you making up all sorts of excuses?

480
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,100
 Oh, I'm too busy.

481
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,500
 Oh, I have work.

482
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
 Oh, I have to take care of this and that.

483
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:42,700
 Or are we investing time to serve the Lord?

484
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,100
 The second thing is, are we overcome by fear?

485
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,820
 Are we courageous in faith?

486
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,700
 We need to seek discernment.

487
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,220
 Is this fear from God?

488
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,420
 Or is this fear from the devil,

489
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,300
 preventing me from serving God,

490
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,300
 paralyzing me from doing what God wants me to do?

491
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,900
 We need to seek discernment and surrender to the Holy Spirit.

492
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:25,500
 And we also need to reflect the truth

493
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,100
 and the life of Christ in our life.

494
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:34,900
 Every day, as we go to work, as we go to school,

495
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:42,300
 the media, everybody is telling you something different

496
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,700
 from what the truth is.

497
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,900
 We're bombarded every day

498
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,900
 with something other than the truth.

499
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,500
 And we need to protect the word of God.

500
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,700
 And we need to reflect that truth and life in our life.

501
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:04,300
 And lastly, what have you been entrusted with?

502
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,500
 What has God entrusted you with?

503
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,700
 Maybe it's the worship team.

504
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,700
 Maybe God has entrusted you with responsibilities at work.

505
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,100
 Maybe it's seminary.

506
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,500
 Maybe it's your schooling right now.

507
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,500
 Maybe God has entrusted you with friends and family

508
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
 who don't know Jesus yet.

509
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,900
 And He wants you to commit your life

510
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,900
 to sharing His love and His truth to them.

511
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,900
 Are you willing to stand on guard?

512
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,100
 Are you willing to stand on guard?

513
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,100
 And the last thing I think about when I'm standing on guard

514
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,700
 is Hong Kong's first gold medal.

515
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,500
 What's his name?

516
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
 What's his name?

517
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,700
 Cheung Ka-long, Edgar Cheung.

518
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,300
 Do you know what he was ranked in the world rankings

519
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,700
 before he went to win the gold medal?

520
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,100
 Do you know what he was ranked?

521
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,200
 10, good guess.

522
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,400
 Any other takers?

523
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,200
 He was ranked 19th.

524
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,500
 19th.

525
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,600
 He wasn't expected to win.

526
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:32,200
 That's like Canada winning the World Cup.

527
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,600
 Is Canada worth 19?

528
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,000
 Probably not even 19.

529
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,100
 Right?

530
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,600
 Probably 100 something, right?

531
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,440
 Canada's.

532
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,000
 This is what he said.

533
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,900
 "I thought to myself,

534
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,200
 "everyone was either an Olympic champion

535
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,900
 "or a world champion, and I was nobody.

536
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,400
 "That helped me to relax a bit.

537
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,100
 "At this moment, I still cannot believe

538
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,300
 "that I'm the champion."

539
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,100
 He was so, under so much pressure,

540
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,000
 and he had to relax himself.

541
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,600
 Timothy was also overwhelmed

542
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,700
 by all the ministry that he had to do.

543
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,800
 Maybe all the false teachers that were attacking him.

544
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,800
 He was also overwhelmed,

545
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,300
 but he was willing to stand on guard

546
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,300
 as Paul encouraged him.

547
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,300
 And Edgar Chan says, Cheung says this,

548
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,100
 "After winning, I told myself, I can't get complacent.

549
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:46,100
 "I'll continue to work hard to bring glory to Hong Kong."

550
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,200
 To bring glory to Hong Kong.

551
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,400
 Imagine if we as Christians

552
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,700
 are as committed

553
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,900
 to guarding Christ and his truth

554
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,000
 as much as Edgar is willing

555
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,900
 to devote himself to a sport of fencing.

556
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,400
 He dedicated his life,

557
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,000
 started from a young age to fencing,

558
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,100
 and eventually he worked so hard,

559
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,400
 even though he was the underdog,

560
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,900
 he won the gold medal.

561
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,000
 Are we willing to dedicate our life

562
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,700
 to guard the gospel truth,

563
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,400
 to stand for his truth,

564
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,700
 to use our gifts,

565
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,300
 dedicate our life,

566
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:40,100
 protect what has been entrusted to us?

567
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,700
 Are we willing to do that?

568
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:47,500
 And then eventually, we will also be champions.

569
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,000
 Champions for the Lord.

570
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,400
 To receive the crown of glory

571
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,300
 that Jesus has promised

572
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,900
 and Paul later talks about

573
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,000
 in the rest of the chapters.

574
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Let us take some time to respond

575
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,500
 as the band comes up.

576
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,000
 Are we willing to stand on guard?

577
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Let's take a moment to just think about

578
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,300
 what has God entrusted you with?

579
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,600
 Your gifts.

580
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,400
 Your ministry.

581
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,000
 The people around you.

582
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,300
 The truth, the Bible, gospel truth.

583
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,100
 God has entrusted you with these things.

584
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:51,300
 Are you willing to guard these things?

585
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,400
 To use these things, fan into flame?

586
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,900
 The gifts that you have been given.

587
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,100
 Surrender these things.

588
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,100
 Surrender your emotions, your fears to the Lord.

589
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,100
 Are you willing?

590
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:20,200
 Let's just take a moment to pray and seek the Lord.

591
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,700
 What has he entrusted us?

592
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,000
 (soft music)

593
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:38,700
 Heavenly Father, we thank you for this message.

594
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,100
 Paul's charge to Timothy,

595
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,600
 to guard his spiritual gifts.

596
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,000
 Not be fearful.

597
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,600
 To guard the truth.

598
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,700
 To commit himself to what he's been entrusted with.

599
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,900
 I pray that also for us.

600
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,800
 That the things you've blessed us with,

601
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,400
 it wouldn't just stay with us,

602
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,100
 but that we would pass it on to those around us.

603
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:17,100
 You bless us so that we could bless others.

604
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,200
 Could bless others.

605
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,700
 And they could know the truth.

606
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,600
 And they can know the light and life of Christ.

607
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,600
 Bless us Lord.

608
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,400
 Guide us by your Holy Spirit.

609
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,800
 In Christ's name we pray.

610
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,700
 Amen.
