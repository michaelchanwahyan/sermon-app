1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
 Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,280
 Very good.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,640
 Very, very good to see you all.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,840
 We've been having a lot of fun doing the family gathering.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,880
 Don't worry, you're not missing out on too much.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,480
 It's just a very simple gathering.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,880
 Our vision is that it's a very simple gathering in this complicated world.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,800
 How do we gather people who would be spiritual parents that are devoted to loving the Lord

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,360
 and making disciples and serving others?

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
 That's it.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,680
 It's really just as simple as that.

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,800
 But it's a joy to be able to be back here and of course see my beautiful niece as well

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:47,160
 who doesn't usually sit through my sermons quietly.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,800
 But she's very, very cute.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,960
 Proclaiming the gospel.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,560
 You guys have been going through this series of equipping the saints.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,600
 The vision for the church is to equip the saints and serve the community.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 Who are the saints?

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
 Who are the saints?

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,600
 It's you.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
 You're all the saints.

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
 Put your hand up.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,760
 If you're a saint, put your hand up.

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
 You are a saint.

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
 You're a saint in progress.

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
 You're not done yet.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
 You're not the perfect thing yet.

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
 But you're a saint.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,080
 The question then becomes, as we as a church, how do we equip each other to go out to serve

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
 the community?

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,000
 How do we equip each other to do these different things?

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,480
 And of course we've got Pastor Johnny over there, the ever young Peter Pan, Pastor Johnny,

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,160
 wearing his Lakers jersey, represent.

34
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,280
 Equip you to evangelise like Pastor Johnny.

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,520
 Now when it comes to this one, it's proclaiming the gospel and John's been very kind about

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,560
 it saying it's about preaching the word.

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,820
 And in some regards it is.

38
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,240
 But I'm not qualified to teach you how to preach.

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,920
 Actually I think it's not something that we should talk about here actually.

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,640
 But as I'm thinking about what it means to proclaim the gospel, I think it is very important.

41
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,640
 Because actually the role of proclaiming the gospel isn't just the pastor here or the reverend

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,600
 here standing up here and saying, "Repent.

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,160
 The kingdom of heaven is near.

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,720
 Let's open up the Bible and let's do an expository sermon on something and let me teach you how

45
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
 to do it."

46
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,320
 It's going to be in three points because we can only remember three points and are teaching

47
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
 you the way to preach.

48
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,000
 It's not really about that.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,360
 Proclaiming the gospel is something that all of us should do.

50
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,200
 Francis Chan was the one that said, "Proclaiming the gospel to a lost world should be the central

51
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,200
 task of a church."

52
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,000
 Unfortunately it's often just a side dish because we have so many other activities, so

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,840
 many other programmes.

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,400
 But proclaiming the gospel should be the central thing.

55
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,760
 It should be our main purpose.

56
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,520
 It should be our identity.

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,560
 You should be able to preach the gospel.

58
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,160
 You should be able to proclaim the gospel.

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,600
 And if you don't feel as though you can't, guess who's not doing their job?

60
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,880
 Us.

61
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,480
 Because our role isn't to just be the ones that proclaim the gospel for you, but it's

62
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,240
 to equip you to be able to do the same.

63
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,520
 So for today, we're going to go through what it means to really proclaim the gospel and

64
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,920
 I'll share with you a little bit of my experiences about that because it is so important.

65
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,000
 In Scripture it says, 1 Peter 3, it says, "Be prepared."

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,320
 JP, be prepared to explain to other people the hope that you have.

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
 Be prepared.

68
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,520
 When people look at you and go, "Why does JP have this kind of hope?

69
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,720
 Why are his curtains just so perfect?

70
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,520
 Straight from the 90s?"

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,920
 And you've got to be able to say, "Well, this is why my curtains are so perfect."

72
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
 Sorry.

73
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
 Sorry.

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:48,960
 2 Timothy 4 says, "Preach the word."

75
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,580
 In and out of season, you need to be ready, prepared to preach the word, to proclaim the

76
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,580
 gospel.

77
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,400
 But before I talk to you about how you are supposed to proclaim the gospel, let me rewind

78
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,560
 a little bit.

79
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
 What is the gospel?

80
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,800
 I won't put anyone on the spot like I just did with JP, but let me just pose that to

81
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,720
 you and give you 10 seconds.

82
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,000
 If you were to need to explain what's the gospel, you'll hear it.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
 We've all heard it before.

84
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,760
 We've sang it in some of the songs.

85
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,240
 What is the gospel to you?

86
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,680
 If you were to simplify it into a simple statement, a simple sentence, what is the gospel to you?

87
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,560
 You see, the thing is, if we're going to equip you to proclaim the gospel, we first have

88
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,900
 to explain to you, then make sure that you understand what the gospel is, so you can

89
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,080
 explain it to someone else in a very clear and simple way.

90
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,160
 So therefore, I ask again, what is the gospel?

91
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,860
 And how would you explain it?

92
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,860
 Because that is key.

93
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,380
 And so I want to make a few points.

94
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,920
 My final point, I'll jump to the end, is hopefully we'll be in a space where we feel equipped,

95
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
 where we feel inspired to proclaim the gospel.

96
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
 That's the end, okay?

97
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,600
 That's where we're going to head.

98
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,480
 The first two things that we're going to talk about are, in my mind, prerequisites.

99
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,000
 First you have to receive the gospel, then you have to respond to the gospel, and then

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,040
 you can proclaim the gospel.

101
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,200
 First you have to receive it and hear it, so you know what it is, and then you have

102
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:21,120
 to live it out and respond to it, and then, and only then, can you proclaim it.

103
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,760
 Only then.

104
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,560
 Have you heard the gospel?

105
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,440
 Recently, have you heard the gospel?

106
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,880
 If the gospel is so important, if we're going to be a community that is centered on the

107
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,440
 gospel, have you heard it recently?

108
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,480
 Let me tell you what I think the gospel might be, and there's some great quotes about this.

109
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
 You can just Google them online.

110
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,600
 I've put one up there later for you to see.

111
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,280
 But if I was to sum it up, what the gospel is, is of course, well, we know what the word

112
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
 gospel means.

113
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,900
 It means good news, right?

114
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,160
 It means good news.

115
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,200
 Why is the good news so important, though?

116
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,900
 Do you know why it's so important?

117
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:59,080
 The good news is so good and so important because we have bad news.

118
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,160
 So in order to understand the gospel, the good news, we first have to acknowledge that

119
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,920
 there is bad news.

120
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,200
 And this is the bad news, and this is how I'm going to sum it up.

121
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,480
 The bad news is this.

122
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,000
 You are not enough.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,800
 That is the bad news.

124
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,440
 Reverend Doctor, former founding senior pastor, current lead pastor, pastor of the whole city,

125
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,240
 John Snellgrove, you are not enough.

126
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
 That is the gospel.

127
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,160
 At least that's the first part of it, right?

128
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,600
 The gospel is it doesn't matter how good you are, you are not enough.

129
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,160
 Florence Lau, I'm picking on people today.

130
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
 It's one of those days.

131
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
 I'm sorry.

132
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,920
 You guys, I'm just going to keep you all away.

133
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:57,680
 Florence Lau, CEO of Canto Gather, dentist, incredible worship leader, you are not enough.

134
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
 You are not enough.

135
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,960
 And what's more, you will never be enough.

136
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
 That's the bad news.

137
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,840
 But what's the good news then?

138
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:14,160
 The good news then, even though you on your own are not enough, but with Him, you are

139
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,040
 already enough.

140
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,200
 That is the gospel.

141
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:28,400
 Even someone like Paul is enough because of Him.

142
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,080
 Not because of Mel, but because of all of us.

143
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,080
 I don't know where you are in your life right now, whether you feel as though you're a good

144
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,440
 person or a bad person, a good Christian or a bad Christian.

145
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,960
 I can tell you right now, I can confidently say that you are enough because of Jesus.

146
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 When people accept the gospel or believe in the gospel, what do they usually say?

147
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
 Oh, they've accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior.

148
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,200
 You've heard that term before, right?

149
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,960
 Hey, would you pray that you would accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior?

150
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,920
 That means you're admitting that you need saving.

151
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,640
 If you need a Savior, that means you need saving because you're drowning, because you're

152
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
 dying.

153
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
 That's the gospel.

154
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,480
 Tim Keller has this, and I think I've got it up later.

155
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,600
 The gospel is that you are far worse than you ever imagined, but far more loved than

156
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,360
 you ever dared dream.

157
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
 You are far worse.

158
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,040
 Don't even think about it.

159
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,200
 You're not enough.

160
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,400
 But you are far more loved than you ever dared dream or that you ever dared hope.

161
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,280
 That is the gospel.

162
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,320
 But then you might say, "Well, okay, James, that's just your quote.

163
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,160
 You are not enough, and now you are enough.

164
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,200
 That's a kind of easy quote to remember."

165
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,400
 Or this Tim Keller one, it's nice and clever as well.

166
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
 But what about the Bible?

167
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,580
 Because actually, our definition of the gospel should be from here.

168
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,760
 It doesn't matter what James Tang says.

169
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,840
 It doesn't matter what Tim Keller says.

170
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
 It's here.

171
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,880
 So if you're to explain the gospel to someone, or if you are to hear the gospel again properly,

172
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,000
 where would you go in this book to tell you that you are not enough, but because of him,

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,380
 you are?

174
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,380
 Where would you go?

175
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,480
 There's, of course, plenty of places to go, but I want to show you a few today.

176
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
 The first one is this.

177
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
 That bad news, let me go back.

178
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
 Oh, okay.

179
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
 Thank you.

180
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
 Oh, here we go.

181
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
 Number one is this.

182
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,040
 Romans is where you're going to find a lot of this stuff, by the way.

183
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,080
 Romans 3 says, "No one is good."

184
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,880
 Jesus himself, when he was asked, "How do you get into eternal life, good teacher?"

185
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,800
 He's like, "What do you mean, good teacher?

186
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
 No one's good.

187
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
 Only God is good.

188
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 You are not good.

189
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
 You are not good enough.

190
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,520
 No one is righteous.

191
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
 Not one.

192
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,640
 Not you, nor I.

193
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
 No one is good.

194
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,960
 In that same chapter, verse 23, it carries on.

195
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,640
 "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."

196
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,480
 There is no distinction.

197
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,880
 All of you fall short of the glory of God.

198
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
 Everyone.

199
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,240
 It doesn't matter whether you're a reverend or a pastor, or whether you're an elder or

200
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,520
 you're a deacon, or whether you're a businessman, whatever it is, we all fall short of the glory

201
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
 of God.

202
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,760
 Pastor Johnny is wearing a basketball jersey today, which I don't know if you noticed,

203
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,620
 number six Lakers, and it's a guy called LeBron James.

204
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,920
 Some people call him the goat, which is the greatest of all time, but he is not the goat.

205
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
 Correct, JP?

206
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
 He is not the goat.

207
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,760
 Michael Jordan is the goat.

208
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
 Thank you.

209
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:13,720
 LeBron James, he's wearing it out of tribute for LeBron, because LeBron recently, this

210
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,760
 last week, became the highest scoring NBA basketball player in the history of the game.

211
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,480
 He broke a record that was 40 years old.

212
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,320
 Let's say I look at LeBron James and I go, "Let's have a jumping competition."

213
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
 LeBron James is six foot eight.

214
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,760
 "Let's have a jumping competition, me and LeBron James.

215
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
 Who's going to win?"

216
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,160
 "Well, of course it's going to be me."

217
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
 "No, well, okay.

218
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,200
 If we're going to be able to touch the ceiling, well, he's the only one who's going to be

219
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,640
 able to touch the ceiling."

220
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,680
 It's not really a competition.

221
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,600
 It's not really a comparison.

222
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,440
 But if you say, "Hey, let's have another jumping competition, but let's both try and jump to

223
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,040
 the moon.

224
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,840
 You and I, LeBron, me and you right now, let's have a competition.

225
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,920
 Who can jump to the moon?"

226
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
 There is no distinction then.

227
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,020
 It doesn't matter if he jumps a little bit more than me.

228
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,400
 He's nowhere near the moon.

229
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,600
 He falls short too.

230
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
 That's the same.

231
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,400
 If you're sat there going, "I don't even know if I'm a real Christian yet," I'll tell you,

232
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
 you're just the same as me.

233
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
 You're just the same as Johnny.

234
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
 You're just the same as Johnny.

235
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
 All of us fall short.

236
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
 Welcome.

237
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
 We're all sinners.

238
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,120
 We are all drowning.

239
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,200
 We all need to be saved.

240
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
 But what's the hope?

241
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 What's the good news?

242
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
 Now it starts to turn.

243
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,480
 Romans 5, it says this, "But God shows his love for us that while we were still sinners,"

244
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,360
 while you're sat in your chair right now and you're still a sinner, "he turns you into

245
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,680
 a saint by dying for you."

246
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,840
 While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

247
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,160
 You are never enough on your own.

248
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,840
 But with God, you are more than enough already because of what he did.

249
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
 Romans 5, 8.

250
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,400
 And maybe the one that really hits home to me the most is Romans, the next chapter is

251
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,000
 this, Romans 6, 23, "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 life in Jesus Christ our Lord."

253
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,080
 That means anyone who has sinned has to pay a price.

254
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,240
 There is a wage there is that needs to be paid.

255
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,320
 And you can't pay it yourself, but you can't pay yourself, but someone has paid it for

256
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
 you.

257
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,760
 Jesus Christ died as a ransom for many, Isaiah 53.

258
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,140
 That's the good news.

259
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,560
 The good news is that you were bad news, that you were drowning, you were dying, you were

260
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,320
 dead, you were blind, you were lost.

261
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,080
 But because of him, you are now alive.

262
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,680
 You are now found.

263
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,280
 You can now see the good news.

264
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
 That is the gospel.

265
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,680
 That is one that we all have to remember.

266
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,840
 There's another part, I haven't put it on the slides here.

267
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,080
 There's another passage that really hits me.

268
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,820
 It's in Ephesians.

269
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,820
 And it says this.

270
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,540
 It says, "You were once dead in your trespasses and sins, that you were following the course

271
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,100
 of this world.

272
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,580
 You were following the prince of the power of the air, and you were carrying out the

273
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,740
 desires of your body.

274
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,460
 And you by nature were children of wrath."

275
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,820
 And then it says this, and then it pivots, and then it twists.

276
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,060
 That was the bad news.

277
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,580
 You were dead in your trespasses, but God, being rich in mercy because of his great love

278
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,100
 for you, has made you alive now.

279
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
 That is the gospel.

280
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,200
 How are we going to get to a point where all of us here can proclaim the gospel?

281
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,660
 We start with this.

282
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,420
 Have you received the gospel in your heart?

283
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,740
 Do you actually know that, "Man, without God, I am truly dead.

284
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,620
 I have no chance of surviving.

285
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
 I have no chance.

286
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,700
 I am not enough.

287
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,220
 But with God, man, that's everything."

288
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,820
 I would be remiss to talk to you about how to proclaim the gospel, how to preach the

289
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,820
 word without at least sharing this with you.

290
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,340
 There's another quote that I really like.

291
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,900
 They said, "A lot of ministers spend so much of their time preaching about the gospel rather

292
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
 than preaching the gospel."

293
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,500
 I'm talking to you about it.

294
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
 Let's open up this word.

295
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
 Let's exposit this passage.

296
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
 Let's do this.

297
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 Let's do that.

298
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
 Let's make it cool.

299
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
 Let's use acronyms.

300
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
 Let's do all these things.

301
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,260
 But we spend so much time preaching about the gospel, we neglect to actually preach the

302
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,080
 gospel to you, which is that you are sinners.

303
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,360
 We are sinners.

304
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,680
 But without him, we'd be gone.

305
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,780
 But with him, we are now alive together.

306
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,780
 That's the gospel.

307
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,500
 I don't know where you are in your life right now.

308
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,540
 I don't know where you are in your spiritual state, but I wanted to share that with you.

309
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,420
 I want you to be able to proclaim the gospel, but I first want you to be able to receive

310
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,660
 it, to receive it in your heart.

311
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,300
 That same quote then carries on and says, "Too many ministers focus on talking about

312
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,700
 sinners rather than talking to them."

313
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:53,340
 So I'm talking to you right now as fellow sinners.

314
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,020
 It's bad news.

315
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,520
 We're not enough.

316
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,140
 But with Christ, we are.

317
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,860
 We first must have that gospel.

318
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,980
 And there's this really simple quote that I also came across by a guy called John McArthur.

319
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,900
 It says, "The simplicity of the gospel gives what the complexity of human wisdom promises,

320
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
 but never delivers."

321
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,700
 You see, we know this.

322
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,820
 We know that despite all our efforts to be the best people that we can be, to be the

323
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:24,140
 best Christians we can be, we know that there's something missing if it was just down to us.

324
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,140
 The gospel is a simple gospel.

325
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,940
 It's that there was bad news, and there was darkness.

326
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,220
 But from that darkness, from that bad news, there is now good news.

327
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,820
 Until we truly, truly, truly come to terms with that, I don't know if we'll be able to

328
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:47,820
 truly proclaim the gospel in its most accurate form.

329
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,500
 Brothers and sisters, have you heard the gospel?

330
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,820
 Do you remind yourself of the gospel every day?

331
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,580
 Do you wake up and go, "Jesus, thank you that I am alive, that I'm breathing because of

332
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:05,780
 you, because if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even be here.

333
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,220
 I wouldn't even be here."

334
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,260
 That is the gospel.

335
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
 So you receive it.

336
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,860
 You see, when you receive that gospel, it changes everything.

337
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,140
 The gospel frees you from everything.

338
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,020
 I don't know if you've truly received the gospel, but I want to tell you now, if you've

339
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,740
 received the gospel, it truly transforms everything.

340
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
 It frees you.

341
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,740
 What does it free you from?

342
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,340
 It frees you from fear, because you're like, "The gospel is that I was going to die.

343
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,980
 I should have died.

344
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,340
 And actually, I will now die to myself, but now it is Christ who lives in me.

345
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,740
 Christ defeated my greatest fear, death.

346
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,740
 He defeated death, and now I'm alive.

347
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,380
 What else do I have to be afraid of?"

348
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,100
 You're freed from worry.

349
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
 You're freed from worry.

350
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,780
 Jesus says, "Look at the birds.

351
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,220
 They don't sow, nor reap, nor gather in their barns, yet the heavenly Father feeds them.

352
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,620
 Are you not of more value to them?"

353
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:03,020
 Romans 8, "The God who gave his own Son, will he not graciously give you all the things

354
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,780
 that you need?"

355
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,900
 When you understand that gospel, it frees you from worry.

356
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,060
 It frees you from fear.

357
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,260
 It frees you from anger.

358
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,460
 Next time you're tempted or you're open to be offended by someone, you're like, "Oh,

359
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:18,300
 I don't need to be offended and angry at you anymore, because Jesus Christ took the most

360
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,940
 ultimate offense for me, so that I won't need to be offended by you."

361
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,780
 The gospel frees you from that anger.

362
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,780
 He frees you from the fear.

363
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,780
 He frees you from the worry.

364
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,780
 That good news.

365
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,420
 Once you've received that good news, nothing else really matters.

366
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,300
 That, brothers and sisters, is the gospel.

367
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,700
 And then you hear it.

368
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,300
 I'm sharing the gospel with you now.

369
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,580
 At least I hope I'm sharing the gospel with you now, and you're receiving it into your

370
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,540
 mind, and then you let it drop into your heart.

371
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,940
 And then you're like, "Man, what he's saying is true.

372
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,420
 Not because he's using eloquent words, but man, it's true, because I know that I am a

373
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,420
 sinner.

374
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
 But I feel some joy.

375
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,060
 I feel some hope, because someone's saved me from this."

376
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,540
 This is what happens to the people, the listeners, in Acts 2.

377
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,220
 You know, in Pentecost, when Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, and then he stands up

378
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,260
 and he preaches a sermon that he's never done before in the past, and what happens?

379
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,620
 People hear this, and he preaches.

380
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,620
 He proclaims the gospel.

381
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,580
 They call it the kerygma.

382
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,380
 It's a declaration of the life and death and resurrection of Jesus.

383
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,380
 He just proclaims it out.

384
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,740
 He just says it all out.

385
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,140
 And then the people listening, just like yourselves, what happens to them?

386
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,140
 They hear it in their ears.

387
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,220
 It goes into their minds, and then it cuts to their heart.

388
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,220
 Acts 2.37.

389
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,540
 It cuts to their heart.

390
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,940
 That's what the gospel does, if you would allow it.

391
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,180
 It cuts to the heart, and then it changes everything.

392
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:54,380
 First, you receive the gospel, and then you respond to the gospel.

393
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:01,820
 There are so many of us in the Christian faith who I would call believers, but not followers.

394
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,540
 I think many times I have that wrestling.

395
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,460
 I'm like, "I believe in you, God, but I don't know if I actually follow you."

396
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,220
 Jesus says, "Believe in me," but then he doesn't just say, "Believe in me."

397
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,220
 That's like step one.

398
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,220
 "Believe that I exist."

399
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
 That's great.

400
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,620
 But then you've got to follow me.

401
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,020
 He tells the fishermen, "Follow me."

402
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,740
 You know, there's a new religion, or there's a new group of people that is rising up, especially

403
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,060
 in the West, that believe in a certain kind of faith, and it's growing, and it's gaining

404
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,700
 traction, especially in the West, and it's called moralistic therapeutic deism.

405
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,900
 Let me say that again.

406
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,900
 It's called moralistic therapeutic deism.

407
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,940
 What is this?

408
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
 This is the next generation.

409
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,940
 I'll tell you this is what they believe.

410
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,220
 They believe that there is a God.

411
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,220
 He's out there somewhere.

412
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,220
 He's divine.

413
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
 He's mysterious.

414
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,540
 They're fine with that.

415
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,260
 They believe that there's a higher being out there.

416
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:05,620
 And this higher being wants them to live a happy and comfortable and good life.

417
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,140
 That's the moralistic therapeutic side.

418
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,740
 It's like, "Oh, yeah, I know that I should be a good person.

419
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,620
 Something up there tells me that I should be a good person."

420
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,620
 That's the moral side.

421
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,620
 So I'm going to get my morals wrong.

422
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,820
 "Oh, that's not good.

423
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,180
 Someone up there wants me to be good."

424
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,380
 And then there's the therapeutic side.

425
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,380
 "That someone up there also wants me to live a happy, comfortable, good life."

426
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,260
 So when something's not going right, then something's wrong.

427
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,980
 And this faith in this higher being just gives me comfort.

428
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,100
 And deism is just this divine being.

429
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,220
 That's what they believe.

430
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,700
 My question to you is, do you believe any different?

431
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,740
 Do you treat the Christian God, do you treat Jesus Christ any differently?

432
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,740
 Do I?

433
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,740
 That's the question I ask myself.

434
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:53,020
 Or actually, do I just use Jesus as someone who encourages me to be a good person, gives

435
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,820
 me comfort when I need to, and that's about it?

436
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,540
 And he wants me to live a good and happy life.

437
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,420
 And if I'm good and happy, I'll get to heaven.

438
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,980
 That's the danger.

439
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,060
 So often we can step over that, right?

440
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,580
 Because Jesus is good.

441
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,900
 Jesus wants us to be content.

442
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,380
 But we've got to be careful that we don't step over into this moralistic, therapeutic

443
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,460
 deism that we just think God is here to serve us, to make us feel like we're having a happy

444
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
 life.

445
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,420
 Charles Spurgeon was the one that said, "Discernment isn't discerning between what's right and

446
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,420
 wrong.

447
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:31,580
 It's discerning between what's right and what's almost right."

448
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,860
 Your faith, is it right?

449
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,460
 I mean, you're here, so I'm hoping to give us all the benefit of the doubt that it's

450
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,100
 not bad.

451
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,140
 I hope I'm preaching to the choir.

452
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,820
 Is it right or is it just almost right?

453
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,780
 Because that's dangerous.

454
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,020
 Because if you're actually just almost right and you think you're right, that means you

455
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,940
 may never be right because you don't feel the need to, because you don't really understand

456
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,940
 the gospel.

457
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:06,100
 If you've accepted that you are bad news and without him, you will die.

458
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,020
 Don't be almost right.

459
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,260
 Be right.

460
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,360
 Accept and understand and receive the true gospel.

461
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,060
 After that, you must respond to it.

462
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:19,020
 There's a passage in Philippians that says this, "Only let your manner of life be worthy

463
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,940
 of the gospel of Christ.

464
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,380
 So whether I'm to come and see you or I'm absent, I'm here of you standing firm in this

465
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,700
 faith, striving side by side for the faith of the gospel."

466
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,100
 He's saying, "Look, if you've actually received this gospel, if you actually understand it,

467
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,860
 I need you to respond accordingly.

468
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:39,260
 I need you to live in a way that is appropriate for what's just happened to you.

469
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,300
 That you were going to die, that you were lost, that you were in debt, but now it's

470
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,140
 all been paid.

471
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
 Live accordingly."

472
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,620
 But how many of us think about this and kind of understand the gospel, kind of understand

473
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,540
 the good news and, "Oh, Jesus did that for me.

474
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
 Good."

475
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,980
 But then we don't live a life that is worthy, that is appropriate.

476
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,540
 You've got to respond accordingly.

477
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,380
 Tim Keller says this, "If you truly understand who Jesus is, the only way to respond to him

478
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,340
 is extremely.

479
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,780
 The only way to respond to Jesus Christ is extremely.

480
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,580
 It cannot be moderately.

481
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,120
 You can't just, 'Oh, Jesus is a nice guy.

482
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
 He said some good things.'"

483
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,780
 No, no, no, no, you can't.

484
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:25,180
 He's either Lord of your life or he's a fraud.

485
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,100
 He's either Lord or he's a fraud.

486
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,540
 When I was in Africa, I was in Africa a couple of months ago and I got to meet a lot of the

487
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,980
 Young Life heads around the globe.

488
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,300
 And I was sitting with my supervisor and he was kind of introducing me to all these big

489
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,300
 heads.

490
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,300
 This is the president of Young Life.

491
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,980
 This is the group vice president of this, that, that, that.

492
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,580
 He said, "Young Life is great because it's an ecumenical organization."

493
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,420
 That means it's non-denominational.

494
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:50,700
 People of all sides of the faith come together and he said, "You're going to meet leaders

495
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,900
 of all different kinds.

496
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,620
 You're going to meet this leader over here."

497
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,100
 He used to be in the corporate world and he was a CEO, so he's proper.

498
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,700
 He tucks his shirt in and his belts.

499
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
 He's just a proper guy.

500
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,060
 He's always going to wear a suit jacket, but he loves the Lord.

501
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,720
 He loves the Lord, but he is so just, he's just your typical CEO type, but he has a soft

502
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
 heart for the Lord.

503
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,100
 "Over here, tomorrow morning, James, you're going to see this guy.

504
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,660
 And actually, he's going to be standing in the pool with his arms wide open, singing

505
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,140
 to the Lord from the top of his lungs."

506
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,420
 And I thought he was just kind of giving an example and exaggerating, but lo and behold,

507
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,420
 the next morning I wake up, walk down from my hotel room to the restaurant where people

508
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,540
 are having breakfast and we're about 10 meters away from the swimming pool and there he is,

509
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:41,100
 the guy standing fully clothed in the pool, worshipping.

510
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,680
 This is how I fight my battles.

511
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,980
 This is how I fight my battles.

512
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,340
 Ten meters away, his boss and all the other Young Life guys are just standing there, sitting

513
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,140
 there, having coffee, and he's just doing this.

514
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,860
 And then I was like, "Oh, wow, that's strange.

515
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,860
 That's weird."

516
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,780
 And my boss, you know my boss, he's like, "Yeah, I find that hard sometimes to kind

517
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,580
 of get a bit cynical because it's a bit weird."

518
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,940
 And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, me too."

519
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:13,140
 But then I was like, "If God is who we say he is, if God truly is as big a deal as we

520
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:20,500
 sing about him to be, which one is more appropriate?"

521
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,500
 If God walked through that door right now, I don't really know what you'll do and I quite

522
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,900
 frankly wouldn't care what you do.

523
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,320
 I know what I'm going to be doing.

524
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,020
 I'm going to be acting in a very extreme way because I know who he is.

525
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,180
 So we have to respond to the gospel in a way.

526
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,320
 We have to live a life worthy of the gospel of Christ.

527
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,740
 Imagine if you had a huge debt.

528
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,940
 Imagine if Pastor Johnny spent way too much on sneakers and he's bought all the sneakers

529
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:53,580
 in the world and he's now just deeply, deeply, deeply in debt and he's sleeping on shoes.

530
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,980
 He doesn't even have a mattress anymore.

531
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,020
 He's just sleeping on his shoes.

532
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:06,100
 And then someone comes along, someone comes along and just pays all of it off.

533
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:21,580
 What is, this isn't trivia, what is Pastor Johnny's next response?

534
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,620
 What should it be and what will it not be?

535
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:33,100
 He wouldn't be, and bear in mind, this person, this rich donor who's paid off all his debts,

536
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,700
 the reason why he paid it isn't just for giggles, isn't just because he has a lot of money to

537
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,940
 just kind of throw away.

538
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:45,900
 "Oh, let me just help this little young, not very young pastor out who's addicted to shoes."

539
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,860
 It's not just that.

540
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,300
 It's this person actually wants a relationship with him.

541
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:58,380
 "I want to pay this because I want to know you, I want you to know me, Johnny."

542
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,420
 And then imagine Johnny's response, "Ah, cool, thanks.

543
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:12,380
 I guess I've got a bit of money now, I best go buy some more shoes."

544
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,380
 If you were Johnny, you'd be like, "Oh my goodness, I couldn't have ever gotten out

545
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,340
 of that debt by myself.

546
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,980
 I've got myself into that debt, but I can't get myself out.

547
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,500
 But thank you.

548
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
 And you want a relationship?

549
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,300
 I want to know who you are.

550
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,340
 I want to respond to you accordingly.

551
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
 You know what?

552
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,940
 I'm going to spend all of my life trying to get to know you."

553
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,060
 That's what Jesus has done for you, brothers and sisters.

554
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,780
 How do you respond to him?

555
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:45,380
 Is it moderately or is it extremely?

556
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,420
 Because when we're talking about proclaiming the gospel, it has to be do as I do, not do

557
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,380
 as I say.

558
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,380
 We have to live it.

559
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,940
 There's another quote which says, "There's no point walking to go preach if your walking

560
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,940
 isn't your preaching."

561
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:03,180
 There's no point walking to go somewhere to preach if your walking isn't your preaching.

562
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:09,180
 Something that I've held onto myself is, "May my preaching never outrun my living.

563
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,420
 May my preaching never outrun my living.

564
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,380
 May the reason why I even have authority to share about these things is because I'm living

565
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,380
 it right now.

566
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,380
 And I'm not perfect.

567
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,380
 And I'm a sinner just like you.

568
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,300
 But I'm being made a saint just like you.

569
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:28,700
 And because of that, because I'm living it, I can share it with you."

570
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,100
 So the question is, are you responding to the gospel extremely?

571
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,060
 Are you living that life?

572
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,660
 There's this quote that again we hear a lot which is, it's attributed to Francis of Assisi,

573
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,420
 but actually many people don't think it is.

574
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,620
 It's, "Preach the gospel at all times.

575
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,540
 Use words when necessary."

576
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,540
 It's pretty cool.

577
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,060
 It's like, "Oh, what does that mean?

578
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,420
 Preach the gospel at all times.

579
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,420
 Use words when necessary."

580
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,460
 It means you preach the gospel with your life.

581
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,060
 It means you live in a way that people look at you and go, "Whoa, there's something about

582
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,060
 him.

583
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,620
 That person has received some good news.

584
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,780
 He's skipping in the streets.

585
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,580
 He's received some good news and I want to find out what that good news is."

586
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,940
 Jesus says the same thing in Matthew 5, "In the same way, let your light shine before others

587
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,140
 so that others may see your good works and praise can give glory to your Father who is

588
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,140
 in heaven."

589
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:19,500
 So, we say, "Preach the gospel at all times with just the way you live because the gospel

590
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,540
 transforms everything about you."

591
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,580
 And so, you live in a different way.

592
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,580
 You glow.

593
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,220
 You shine in a different way because of the good news that you've received, because of

594
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,900
 the debt that has been paid, because you were literally picked out from the ocean when you

595
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,340
 were drowning, when you were just about to go underwater.

596
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,840
 That is the gospel.

597
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,180
 Do we do that?

598
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
 And that's the great thing.

599
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,260
 You see, because the greatest enemy of the gospel are hypocrites, people who hear the

600
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,700
 news and they're like, "Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

601
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,220
 I'll take the benefits and then I'll just carry on living my life."

602
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,260
 And then the people outside are like, "Oh, you've received your good news but you look

603
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,260
 the same as me.

604
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
 You do the same things as me.

605
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,260
 You talk about the same things.

606
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,260
 You're obsessed over the same things.

607
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,940
 What's that good news?

608
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:06,420
 Clearly, that good news must be fake news because you don't live any differently."

609
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,420
 That's the danger.

610
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:13,400
 So if we as a church want to proclaim the gospel, we must receive it and we must respond

611
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
 to it.

612
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,060
 Now, this is where I get to my final thing.

613
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,700
 You may be saying, "Oh, that's great news to me, James.

614
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,820
 All I need to do to proclaim the gospel is just to live a good life and be a good Christian.

615
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,140
 I don't have to use any words at all."

616
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,820
 But that's incorrect.

617
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:38,500
 Because living out the gospel is one part, but just a lifestyle evangelism is what they

618
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,340
 call it isn't actually enough.

619
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,260
 Johnny will tell you this as an evangelist.

620
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,740
 Just simply being a good Christian isn't going to be enough.

621
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:52,420
 At some point, you will have to articulate with your words the reason why you have this

622
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,980
 hope.

623
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:59,020
 At some point, you will have to present the gospel and proclaim the gospel.

624
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,500
 You have to be able to share the reason why you have that.

625
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,620
 This is where we come to the final passage that Bonnie read for us today.

626
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,180
 Romans 10, verse 14.

627
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,780
 I'll just read it from here.

628
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,340
 "How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed?

629
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,220
 And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard?

630
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,700
 And how are they to hear without someone preaching?

631
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,980
 And how are they to preach unless they are sent?

632
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:28,260
 As it is written, 'How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news.'"

633
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:34,380
 In order for people to truly receive this good news, they have to hear it.

634
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,100
 Faith comes by hearing.

635
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,440
 So they must hear it.

636
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,420
 Just like you're hearing it now.

637
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,420
 Just like you heard it at some point.

638
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
 Faith comes by hearing.

639
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:51,220
 So the thing for us then, if we work backwards here, we can figure out actually what our

640
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
 role is.

641
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,180
 In order for people to receive the good news, first they need to have someone who is sent

642
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,380
 to them, and then after that, they need to have someone who is actually willing to proclaim

643
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,740
 that gospel to them, to preach it to them.

644
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,980
 And only when they're preached to and they hear it, can they believe.

645
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,100
 And only when they believe will they then call on him.

646
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:15,060
 And once they call on him, everyone who calls on the name of Jesus is saved.

647
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,260
 So it starts with this.

648
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,020
 This is the kind of sequence if we work back.

649
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,060
 The question then is, "Oh James, but I don't know if I'm sent."

650
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,060
 Oh, you're sent.

651
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:32,460
 Actually, there's a wonderful quote by Hudson Taylor.

652
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,420
 This is a guy who left the West to basically, he's one of the founding fathers of the Christian

653
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,420
 faith in China.

654
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,500
 And he says this, and I love this quote.

655
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,020
 "It will not do to say that you have no special call to go to China.

656
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,080
 With these facts before you and with the command of the Lord Jesus to go and preach the gospel

657
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,460
 to every creature, you need rather to ascertain whether you have a special call to stay at

658
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,820
 home."

659
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:04,380
 You need rather to ascertain whether you have a special call to stay at home.

660
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,660
 Because Jesus has sent you.

661
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,700
 But this is, I'm sorry if you're like, "Oh, I don't want to do this.

662
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,260
 It's so embarrassing."

663
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
 I'm so sorry.

664
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,180
 The only way to respond to Jesus is extremely.

665
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:21,380
 And so therefore you must, unless you do, unless you wake up and you feel God guiding

666
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:27,300
 you saying, "I want you to stay at home on your sofa."

667
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:33,100
 Unless you hear the tangible voice of God in this Morgan Freeman style saying, "Stay

668
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,140
 at home and continue to Netflix."

669
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:45,060
 Unless you have that, you must get your butt off the sofa and proclaim the gospel.

670
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,100
 Because that's the call for everyone.

671
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,420
 It's the Great Commission, Matthew 28.

672
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,940
 "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.

673
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,020
 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations."

674
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,180
 So we must.

675
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,660
 You are sent already.

676
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,780
 The question then is, have you received the gospel truly in your mind and in your heart?

677
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,780
 And have you responded to it living in a way that's appropriate?

678
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:10,140
 And then are you using the words to be able to share it out?

679
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,060
 That's all that matters.

680
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,380
 That's all it is.

681
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,820
 And this work isn't actually your own.

682
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,340
 This work is a continuation of Jesus' work.

683
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,500
 This isn't, "Oh, but I've got to start this project from the ground up.

684
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,900
 I've got to figure out how to do this."

685
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
 No, no, no, no.

686
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,100
 Jesus, this is Jesus' work.

687
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,380
 Saving souls, salvation belongs to the Lord.

688
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,420
 All we have to do is actually just follow along.

689
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,100
 Jesus himself, when he announced himself, he said, and he, oh, this is not the verse,

690
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
 sorry.

691
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
 And he was preaching in the synagogue.

692
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
 I gave the wrong reference.

693
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,220
 And he says this, "I must preach to the, I must preach the good news of the kingdom of

694
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,860
 heaven to the other towns as well.

695
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,700
 For this was the reason I was sent.

696
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,260
 I must preach the good news to the other towns as well.

697
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,100
 For this was the reason I was sent."

698
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,780
 So Jesus came to do that.

699
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,180
 And now he's asking you to simply continue the work.

700
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,080
 So you are sent, brothers and sisters.

701
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,780
 You are sent.

702
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,780
 You just have to live it out.

703
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,980
 You have to, well, you have to receive it.

704
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,380
 And then you have to respond to it by living it out.

705
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,660
 And then have the words to say.

706
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,780
 Proclaim the gospel, fellow saints.

707
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,980
 I have not really taught you how to preach the word.

708
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,540
 And maybe that qualifies as a bad sermon.

709
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,220
 And I'm not qualified to teach you how to do it.

710
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,980
 But you might, by God's grace, I may have gotten you to a point, encouraged you to a

711
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,940
 point, inspired you to a point, okay, okay, fine, fine, fine.

712
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,580
 I must do it.

713
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,360
 I've heard it now.

714
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,300
 I was bad news, but now I'm good news.

715
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,380
 We'll teach, how can I do it?

716
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,380
 How do I go about it?

717
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,660
 So I'll finish off with some very quick, simple principles that I don't even dare call

718
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:47,580
 it advice or tips, but just principles that I follow when I'm proclaiming the gospel.

719
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,580
 And the first one is this, simplicity.

720
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,100
 You just keep it simple.

721
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:59,340
 You know, Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, Matthew chapters 5 to 7, over 80% of the words that

722
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,940
 he uses were one or two syllables.

723
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:12,220
 There was no long words of sanctification and justification.

724
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:18,780
 It was just love those, love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you.

725
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,180
 It was a very simple message.

726
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,940
 It was a very simple message.

727
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,860
 So don't worry yourself, oh, do I have the right words to say?

728
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:35,620
 If you boil it right down, it is just Jesus loves you.

729
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,060
 You will be surprised, and fellow pastors who care for a lot of people will tell you

730
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:44,500
 this, you will be surprised how many people just need to hear those simple words that

731
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,340
 we brush over all the time.

732
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,620
 Jesus loves you.

733
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,980
 Jesus loves you.

734
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,500
 There is bad news, I'm sorry.

735
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:06,940
 Romans 6 says, "For the wages of sin is death, but there is a free gift of eternal life."

736
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,300
 For you fall short of the glory of God, just like me.

737
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:16,340
 There is no difference between you and I, but you and I are justified freely by His

738
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,700
 grace as a gift.

739
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,980
 It's free.

740
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,980
 It's free.

741
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,860
 Receive it.

742
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,260
 It's a simple gospel.

743
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,020
 It's before and after.

744
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,140
 It's dead, now alive.

745
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,220
 It's blind, now see.

746
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,420
 It's lost, now found.

747
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,700
 It's simple.

748
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,700
 Keep it simple.

749
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,900
 Number two, that ties in.

750
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,900
 Be clear.

751
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,220
 Get to the point where you are able to share with the people that God has placed in front

752
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,140
 of you and say, "This is the reason why I hope, because without Him, I was so lost.

753
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,380
 I was overcome with worry.

754
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,220
 I was overcome with hate and resentment, but because of Him, I am now freed from those

755
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,220
 things."

756
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,900
 And you can do it.

757
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,620
 And share it with humility.

758
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:06,380
 Too many people's idea of church is, "Oh, there's these condescending, old, judgmental

759
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,980
 men who just look down on you and go, 'Do as I say.'"

760
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
 Right?

761
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,980
 "Do as I say."

762
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:20,220
 But when the whole point of the gospel is that we are all sinners, you can share it

763
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,500
 with this humble heart.

764
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,660
 "Don't you worry.

765
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,820
 I'm not judging you because I'm just as bad as you.

766
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,380
 I can't reach the moon either.

767
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,380
 Don't worry.

768
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,580
 It's not as though I have some special hops that gets me to the moon.

769
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,580
 No, no, no.

770
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,580
 We're the same."

771
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,500
 And that ties in with the vulnerability.

772
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:44,300
 The way you proclaim the gospel is you just share with them how you heard the gospel,

773
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,420
 how you received the gospel, and how you're responding to it.

774
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:54,180
 Paul, the greatest evangelist that ever lived, Paul, said, "I am the worst of the apostles."

775
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,540
 Romans 7, "For what I know I should do, I don't do.

776
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,380
 And what I know I shouldn't do, I do do.

777
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,380
 What a wretched man I am."

778
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,380
 That's Paul.

779
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,420
 That's the apostle Paul who says that.

780
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,340
 "But thanks be to God because of Jesus."

781
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,460
 So don't be afraid to share your vulnerabilities.

782
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,460
 Don't be afraid to share the struggles.

783
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,180
 And finally, have the audacity.

784
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,220
 Don't be ashamed of the gospel.

785
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:27,300
 It is truth because you've experienced it, because you've lived it, and because we believe

786
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,940
 that this is truth, that this is the word of God.

787
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,660
 These are the only words in the whole world that are living and active.

788
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,300
 Be audacious.

789
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:39,060
 Be bold and courageous for the Lord your God is with you.

790
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,940
 Do not be ashamed of the gospel.

791
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:46,020
 It is the truth, and your life is evidence of it.

792
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,420
 So be humble, be vulnerable, but don't be afraid.

793
00:39:51,420 --> 00:40:00,260
 Keep it simple, keep it clear, and when in doubt, call Pastor John.

794
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,900
 Pray, pray.

795
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:14,180
 Father, we thank you, Lord.

796
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:19,140
 Father Lord, we thank you.

797
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:27,300
 We receive the gospel in our minds and in our hearts again this evening.

798
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,260
 Oh God, we were dead in our trespasses.

799
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,340
 We are not good enough.

800
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,260
 We are nowhere near.

801
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:44,140
 But we are sure of this, that he who began a good work in us will bring it to completion.

802
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,220
 We are sure of this, that because of your love, while we were still sinners, you died

803
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,580
 for us.

804
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:55,420
 You paid that debt, you paid that ransom, and now we are free.

805
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:01,820
 And we receive that gospel again this evening.

806
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:06,780
 We receive it in our minds, we believe it, and we let it cut to our hearts.

807
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:22,820
 And so Lord, we want to live our lives in an appropriate way for the one who saved us

808
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,820
 from the ditch.

809
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:36,340
 So Lord, help us live a life worthy of the manna and the calling of the gospel.

810
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,740
 Let others see our good works and give you glory, God.

811
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,380
 Let us shine.

812
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:48,220
 Holy Spirit, can you give us the wisdom on how we can live and respond to you in the

813
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,940
 most radical and extreme way?

814
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:58,500
 Because you deserve all that we have, all that we are, and all that we do.

815
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,540
 And Lord, then give us the words.

816
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:09,500
 We commit to knowing nothing except that Jesus Christ was crucified.

817
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:16,140
 Jesus, the Prince of Heaven, Son of God, came down to earth, emptied himself, taking the

818
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:24,380
 form of a servant, and was crucified on a cross.

819
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,520
 And from that moment on, we are no longer sinners.

820
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:37,940
 From that moment on, we took the first step to becoming from sinners to being saints.

821
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:43,200
 And Lord, may that message permeate through every aspect of our being, our living, and

822
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:54,300
 then come out through words that are loving and simple, yet piercing.

823
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,020
 Thank you, Lord.

824
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:09,140
 Continue to equip us as your children to proclaim your word to every nation, holding on to the

825
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,380
 promise that you will be with us until the end.

826
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,580
 In your name we pray.

827
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,700
 Amen.
