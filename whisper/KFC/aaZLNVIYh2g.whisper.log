[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.240]   Actually, I just want to say thank you guys
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.620]   for having me here tonight,
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.880]   because it's such an honor to actually stand here
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.080]   and share with you guys.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.000]   It's not my comfort zone,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.720]   but I know God's standing here by His Holy Spirit,
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.480]   and He's prepared me to share a word in season for you.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.080]   So I just want to pray over us at the moment,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.000]   just to, Father, you just prepare our hearts
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   just for the word that you have
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.900]   for everyone in this room tonight
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.160]   about your unconditional love
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.840]   that is beyond our understanding.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.120]   It's supernatural, and it is amazing.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.360]   We thank you again in Jesus' name.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.960]   There should be a picture coming up.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.640]   So if you can't see it,
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.560]   this was John's birthday in April,
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.600]   and we had a family brunch.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.760]   There's one person missing,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.860]   which is another mom in our family,
[00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.960]   and that was Sam, our eldest daughter-in-law,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.040]   who was born in Hong Kong,
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.480]   but she had another engagement.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.240]   But this is basically the Snell Groves.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.520]   So we came with four, so we have two sons,
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.260]   and now we have 11 of us in Hong Kong.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.520]   So Snell Groves around Hong Kong, you notice them.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.040]   So actually, if you look up there,
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.960]   I don't know how many generations you can basically see.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.840]   There's three.
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.960]   So there's three generations there
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.600]   with the love of a family running right the way through,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.800]   through a father and a mother, which is us,
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.400]   and we've become grandparents
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.740]   to these wonderful grandkids here,
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.000]   who range from the age of eight to 16.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.020]   So yes, we've got a whole 'nother generation ahead of us
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.500]   coming up and running.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.300]   The love of the family.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.520]   We've had our ups and downs,
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520]   but you know, in the middle of all this,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.080]   there's so many stories I can tell you,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.200]   but I'll tell you them another day.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.320]   And during through all this time,
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.480]   I know that my heavenly father was with me unconditionally
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.720]   as we walked through bringing up these two boys,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.680]   and then the families that we're so proud of,
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.680]   and we're proud of our boys and their wives.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.200]   The love is unconditional,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.640]   and it's an unconditional love of the mother.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.520]   And I can tell you now that these boys
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.280]   will always be on my heart.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.120]   You know, the saying is that it's always a mother
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.880]   that holds the hand of a child,
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.940]   but the hand is only for a while.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.080]   The heart is forever.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.320]   So they're always in my heart as little boys,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.600]   as probably like you are with your parents.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.760]   And through this,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.620]   God gives us a picture of God's love for us.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.760]   Isaiah 66, 13, which should be on the screen, yeah.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.280]   It's a mother comforts a child,
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.300]   so I will comfort you and you will be comforted.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.080]   I have a great dad.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.160]   And my mom died, passed away 28 years ago,
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.960]   and I'm only child.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.920]   So my dad is very precious to me.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.800]   He turned 90, sorry, 90 on Easter Sunday.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.720]   And sometimes when I was growing up as a little girl,
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.320]   he was very, very strict.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.040]   I have a bit of feedback coming there, go on.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.100]   Good to get feedback, exactly.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.640]   So with my dad, when I was a little girl,
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.680]   I can always remember him coming home
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.120]   from a really hard day at work.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.960]   He really worked hard to keep us in a home.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.680]   And he'd come home, he'd sit in his armchair,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.720]   and he'd kick off his shoes.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.960]   And as a little girl of about five or six,
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.240]   even a little bit older,
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.800]   I used to climb up on his lap and I used to sit there,
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.040]   and I'd have all these questions,
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.160]   and questions of our day together.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.720]   And there was loads of questions.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.920]   And as I'm asking, and he's answering,
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.160]   and he's loving this time with his daughter,
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.280]   but he was getting a little bit tired and angry.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.200]   He'd been working from sort of 7.30 in the morning
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.280]   to 6.30 at night, standing up.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.400]   It was just really tiring for him.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.160]   And I could see him getting a little bit angry.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.200]   Well, then my mum had come in the room.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.120]   She'd get in the middle and she'd say,
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.560]   "Right, get to your room."
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.800]   And then she'd make sure that I'd stay in my room
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.920]   for another hour, to give dad a bit of peace and quiet,
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.600]   and then we'd have our tea together.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.000]   That was like a feeling, I was okay with that.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.760]   And just to say that my, don't get me wrong,
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.320]   but my dad actually was, he wouldn't hurt anybody.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.160]   He wouldn't even eat a fly or anything like that.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.160]   So, but we need to remember, like my dad,
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.760]   that human dads, they can be good, or not so good,
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.800]   but we're only human.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.640]   And my dad obviously had to have his time of rest as well.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.080]   So that little story was a bit like
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.960]   my mum coming in to rescue me.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.640]   So there's a little bit of the unconditional love
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.920]   from my mum looking after me,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.360]   but then giving dad that little time out.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.240]   But we see that Father God has our backs
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.800]   in every part of our lives.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   We don't always see or feel that he's there, but he is.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.960]   He knows us before our parents knew us.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.320]   That's actually a mind-boggling thought.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.720]   But, you know, he always is there.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:52.080]   And I know that when I was a little girl, another story.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.200]   When I was a little girl, I was about 10,
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.800]   and I didn't really know Jesus at that time.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   I heard of God, I believed if God was existed.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.720]   I was at school with assemblies in school every morning
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.480]   and hymns and things like that.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.840]   Well, where I lived, I went over to visit my auntie
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.920]   and on the back of her garden was this huge park area
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.160]   with a river and arches.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.240]   And I was told never to go over there,
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.640]   never to go out alone.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.400]   You never know who's about.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.360]   Well, one afternoon I decided to go over there
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.080]   with my friend and explore.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.960]   And we went down to the river
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.200]   and we went down to see the swans.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.760]   And all of a sudden we could hear rustling in the grass.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.840]   Now, I don't know who it was, if somebody was watching us,
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.680]   but did we run.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.240]   I had one friend with me and we ran so fast,
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.160]   we headed for the little chapel
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.160]   that was at the end of the other side of this amazing park.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.920]   Well, I sat in that, I can remember it now,
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.680]   I sat in that pew and I just said,
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.280]   "God, if you're there, just put your protection over me."
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   And sure enough, I just believed at that moment in time,
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.040]   God sowed a seed in me,
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.240]   that the father's germinated that in my heart
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.320]   as I've been growing up.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's still growing, it's still forming in me,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.640]   even from that moment.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.400]   And I believe that it helped me to mother my children
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.200]   and it also to the Kingdom family,
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.480]   which now over the years I would never have foreseen.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.720]   It's an amazing family that's worldwide.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.000]   I could tell you many stories on that one too.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.320]   But I'm not saying that all mothers have brought love
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.640]   and nurturing to their children.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.640]   Some people say, "I don't have a problem with my dad,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.880]   "but I do with my mum."
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.800]   Yeah, I do hear that quite often actually.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.040]   And whether we have difficulty opening our hearts
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.600]   to the masculine figure or a feminine figure,
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.040]   we really deep down want to enjoy that tender love
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.560]   that comforts and nurtures us.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.560]   You know, love is a response and it is to love.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.960]   And we only have to look at to nature.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.960]   If we look on the screen,
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.280]   there should be the wonderful picture
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.280]   of all the little cutie things that we see.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.920]   So we got the sheep and the lamb
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.120]   and we see the little ducklings.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.040]   Where's mum?
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.440]   She's gone, disappeared.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.240]   There's the chicks without the chicken,
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.200]   but then the horse with the foal.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.600]   And basically what this picture says to me
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.360]   is that in creation,
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.280]   mums, whatever animal, whatever we see around us,
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.920]   and they have their youngsters,
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.800]   they will nurture those young ones.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.560]   And they will feed them and they will look after them.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.280]   And you know, I actually personally see God
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.880]   around in creation.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.480]   So I don't just see these animals,
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.080]   I just see the smallest insect sometimes.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.720]   Or you see the famous butterfly.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.200]   Where does that come from?
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.560]   Of course, the caterpillar to the chrysalis
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.760]   to the butterfly.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.720]   So there's a whole world out there that God created.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.560]   And it was his love of setting it in motion from day one.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:23.160]   So looking at these guys here,
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.600]   I'm sure that they only have that little time together
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.680]   and then they become adults.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.320]   And I think that's what we see with a lot of animals.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.920]   But for us as humans, our children are with us.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.640]   And as I said, they're in our heart all the time,
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.640]   even though not physically with us.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.760]   But I don't know if you see love around you.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.520]   I definitely do.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.360]   I definitely see it in lots of ways.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.720]   And as a grandma, you look at your grandkids,
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.800]   but then you also look at other children when they're out.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.920]   Because nurturing in my heart as a mum
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.400]   has allowed me to see children.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.240]   You know, we've got Reuven and AJ down here
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.360]   and I've watched them grow up in the last few years.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.640]   When they were little, now they're bigger.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.520]   But I see them interacting with their parents.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.280]   And I see that and I just thought,
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.480]   hmm, they're gonna grow up too quick.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.400]   Really take the moment with them
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.600]   because every moment will never come again.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.280]   So mums, new mums, nurture those babies.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.320]   You might have to go nights of crying and whatever
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.280]   and feeding, but you know what?
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.600]   You'll never get it again.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.920]   Not with that child, anyway.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.560]   And it's important as we celebrate Mother's Day.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.440]   I say, listen to this.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.440]   We refer to God as father and we pray to our father.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.640]   But did we know that God the father
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.200]   displays not only a masculine quality,
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.960]   but we see him to be having a nurturing heart.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.640]   Or as a mother as well,
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.800]   is from the side of God's personality
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.600]   that enables us as a mother to be able
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.360]   to offer unconditional love to our offspring,
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.960]   no matter what the situation is.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.640]   And it's always there.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:12.040]   And as a mother,
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.720]   the whole is whole enough within herself.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.080]   She's the one who teaches her children
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.720]   how to both love and be loved.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.000]   As a human being, we have to be taught everything.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.520]   Do you remember when you, maybe you don't remember,
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.280]   your parents definitely remember,
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.040]   how you learnt to walk?
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.200]   You might've crawled and pulled yourself on the sofa
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.400]   and had the wobbly steps along
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.640]   and then one day you stepped out on your own
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.920]   and you started to walk.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.800]   Then the first word, was it mama or dada?
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.240]   Who knows?
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.760]   That you start to learn to talk.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.960]   And then don't forget, you're not just fed on milk.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.680]   You get old enough to have solid food.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.320]   So you have to be fed and learn how to eat.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.040]   So among other things, we also need to be taught
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.760]   how to love.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.400]   So my eldest son that you saw earlier,
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.960]   who's now 46.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.920]   When he was little, when he was probably about,
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.560]   let me see, probably about nine,
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.400]   I used to sometimes at the end of the day,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.840]   long day, I'd put my legs up on the sofa
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.800]   and I'd sort of curl up with my legs bent.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.400]   Well, he'd clumber over me and he'd curl up in my legs
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.840]   and he'd come up to me and he'd want that cuddle
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.440]   and he'd want that nurturing.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.800]   And that sort of like taught me
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.640]   how to love the human being in a deeper way.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.880]   There's another story I wanna share with you.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.960]   As you know, we're connected with the Vine Church
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.640]   here in Hong Kong.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.040]   And the senior pastor we've known,
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.960]   grown up for years and he got married
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.880]   and he tried for family for many, many years.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.080]   And unfortunately, they couldn't have their own children.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.760]   So he went for adoption and roll it forward.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.320]   He adopted a beautiful little girl called Mia,
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.600]   but she was 16 months when they adopted her.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.880]   And she was in mother's choice.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.520]   Don't know, many of you may know that's an orphanage
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.360]   for unmarried moms in the beginning,
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.200]   but it's come through that the babies
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.840]   would go out for adoption.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.520]   And it's well known around now.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.480]   Well, Andrew had this little girl and they named her Mia.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.320]   And I can remember him telling the story
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.920]   of when he first met her, which was amazing
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.760]   and tear jerking, I won't go into that one.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.640]   But the first, they brought her home
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.680]   and the first few months was so, so difficult
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.160]   because this little girl had been in an orphanage.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.720]   She'd had love, but she didn't have a love
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.760]   of a mother or father.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.400]   She had a love of a whole group of people
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.160]   that were around her looking after her.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.800]   But when they had taken her home,
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.520]   having had that moment where you get the official adoption
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.640]   and whatever down there, she was at home
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.920]   and it still took months and they're looking at each other
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.360]   and they're going, we really expected her to come.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.480]   Wow, mommy, daddy.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.160]   And that didn't really happen.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.480]   And it took a few months and one day,
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.080]   Andrew was looking at Christine, his wife in the kitchen
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.240]   and Mia was playing around her feet.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.040]   And all of a sudden she grabbed mommy's leg
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.800]   and she held on for dear life.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.840]   And that was her saying, I feel loved and accepted
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.160]   and you're now gonna be my new mom.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.560]   Well, that little girl now has grown up.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.240]   She's in high school and she is amazingly loved by them.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.360]   And obviously the father's plan all along
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.080]   was for them to adopt that child.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.120]   So she was a special, special gift.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.160]   So from those stories,
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.960]   it shows that God is loving us unconditionally
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.600]   no matter who we are, where we're at.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.800]   And I'm not just talking about mothers in this one
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.960]   or indeed females here.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.960]   You know, you men have been given feminine nature as well
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.120]   as a masculine nature.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   This is nothing to do with sexuality,
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:16.200]   but father put within men and women a tender longing
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.280]   and a tender heart of himself.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.280]   It's important to recognise that men have the ability
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.720]   within themselves to express tender longings
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.720]   that come from femininity of God.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.320]   The nurturing love, as I said before,
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.720]   is love is a response to love.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.720]   We learn how to, as a response to being loved,
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.320]   particularly a kind of love known as storge.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.600]   I think it's on the screen.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.880]   It's a Greek word and the Greek words meaning
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.320]   family affection and it conveys tenderness and care.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.520]   It builds the foundation of life.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:06.080]   And now we see in Psalm 113 verse nine,
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:11.000]   he, God, it gives the barren woman a home,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.920]   making her the joyous mother of children.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.200]   Praise the Lord.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:21.240]   Storge can also be shown by the wider family
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.240]   through siblings, if you have them.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.400]   I had cousins, grandparents who doted on me
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.800]   like I was super superhero to them
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.560]   and to the wider church and that is us.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:46.560]   And it's for us to be rooted and grounded in love too.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.960]   He intended that for us.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.640]   I'd like to explore the feminine image a little bit more.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.920]   Woman, I believe, were made for nurture, tenderness,
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.200]   but she was made for lots more too.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.040]   We can do many more things than just all that.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.040]   We're strong, we can do what the guys can do.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.400]   So, and God knows that.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.840]   He has amazing things where he challenges us to step out.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.720]   And he put within us a feminine,
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.960]   something that we see when a baby really responds
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.560]   to a feminine softness.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.640]   Typically, when a father holds a baby,
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.600]   he gives the feeling of strength in his arms
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.240]   as he holds that baby.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.600]   But also as a mother, you can receive nurture
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.320]   that will build up, not destroy,
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.360]   rather it will build you up in life.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:45.200]   Feminine love will establish you to live in holiness.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.360]   You can have a secure, a source of intimacy and belonging.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.720]   Going back to Genesis,
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.600]   the man named his wife Eve
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.960]   because she is the mother of everyone who lives
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.120]   in Genesis 3, 20.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:09.520]   Then God created mankind in his likeness.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.520]   He created male and he created female and blessed them
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.240]   and God made them in his image.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.120]   Then came the fall.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.560]   Adam and Eve sinned and were driven out of the garden.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.640]   Life as intended was broken.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:33.440]   Now, a fallen masculinity and a fallen femininity
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.040]   entered into them.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.960]   There was brokenness and they were distorted.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.840]   But I need to tell you, you were conceived in God's heart
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.200]   long before you were conceived naturally.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.840]   And there are wonderful miracles of healing in our lives.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.280]   Even after the fall,
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:57.800]   and there is an amazing way that a mother comforts a child.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   A father,
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.440]   yeah, a father
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.400]   often comforts in different ways.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.640]   An example there would be the famous story
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.760]   of the little kid that's out in the garden playing
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.440]   or he's out on the beach or he's running around
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.240]   and all of a sudden, mom and dad hear this,
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.080]   (screams)
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.920]   there's screaming and everything's, you know,
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.320]   everything's fallen in his life and so they run out
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.440]   and the father's the first partner to be there.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.320]   And he bends down to the child and he pats him on the back
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.000]   and he says, "There, there, there, you'll be fine.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.840]   "You're fine.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.320]   "You can go out and go back to play.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.160]   "You'll be fine.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.360]   "No worries, you're fine."
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.600]   But what does mom do?
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.000]   The mother does something completely different.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.320]   The mother swoops down and she scoops up the child
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.680]   in her arms and she holds them and she soothes them.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.440]   She comforts them.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.200]   There should be a picture up here
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.440]   of the mother nurturing the baby.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.000]   But if we were not rooted,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   so the father loves you with a perfect love.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.240]   If you are not rooted and established
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.200]   in this nurturing love, in the depths of holiness,
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.400]   we will always be searching for it.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.400]   We will never be satisfied.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.720]   We'll have a constant need for the father,
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.000]   not only expressed in the masculine,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.840]   but expressed in the feminine.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.560]   He not only loves you as a father,
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.680]   but he also loves you as a mother unconditionally.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.840]   My prayer for you today,
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.280]   as that mother looks into that baby's eyes,
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.080]   is to receive unconditional love of the father
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.680]   with a mother heart and a father heart
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.600]   combined in one perfect love.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.680]   I think as the band come up,
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.960]   I just would like to pray for you
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.680]   and pray for you to be able to be a mother
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.400]   and to pray for you.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.520]   And I've had lots of thoughts during the day
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.520]   and I just want us to quieten our hearts down.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:26.840]   And I just wanna invite the Holy Spirit just to come
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:33.640]   and just come into the room and come to us.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.360]   If you're willing to receive what the father has for you,
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.800]   it's just, if you wanna place your hands out
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.640]   just in the air, it's like receiving a gift from the father
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.400]   through his Holy Spirit to you.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:48.280]   Father, I just pray, Holy Spirit, come.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.320]   I pray, Father, that we give permission for you
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.800]   just to touch our hearts and reveal your supernatural,
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.600]   unconditional love for each one in this room.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.920]   That love that is always with us.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.760]   It's a love that will always be with us.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.440]   If we know you, you'll be with us.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.120]   It's a love that will always be there
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.320]   to push us through the times of down times
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.040]   to high times to those in between.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.080]   And he will show himself to you
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.720]   in an amazing way this weekend.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.280]   As we celebrate the mothers that you've given to us,
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.240]   and the children that you've given those mums,
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.680]   and Father, I just pray, Father,
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.360]   this will be a special blessing.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.120]   As we said, that little flower gift that we have,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.440]   if we pray over that as we give it to our mums,
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.880]   that it will make such an amazing blessing on them
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.920]   through your Holy Spirit in them.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.560]   And you know what?
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.800]   We only have to ask for your love.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.320]   And Father, I ask for your love to fill us now.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.840]   I pray that it will be so overwhelming
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.240]   that it will come into our hearts in an amazing way
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.520]   that we cannot explain it in the humanist.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.440]   But you'll come into our hearts in a way
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.400]   that we know that you're real and that you're here with us.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:24.080]   So Father, I pray that you just pour your spirit
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.160]   into every son and daughter in this room.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.960]   And those that are watching online
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.560]   and those that are tuning in later,
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.200]   just, I just pray, Father,
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.760]   that you just show yourself in a new way
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.240]   with that unconditional love
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.200]   that you so desperately wanna give to your children.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   To know that you're our mum and our dad
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.560]   and one that will never, ever let us down.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.920]   So Father, I thank you.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.720]   You've been in this peace in this room.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.160]   And I pray, Father, that you will bless and protect
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.360]   everyone in this room as we go from here.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.200]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.280]   (laughs)
