[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]  (字幕製作:貝爾)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.360]  好,今天我們就會說
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.880]  平安
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.880]  Peace
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.520]  如果我們用一個字去describe 2022
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.520]  你會用什麼字呢?
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.720]  Describe 2022
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.280]  你會用什麼字呢?
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.680]  Everybody shout out their word, okay?
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.080]  Shout out with their word
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.080]  你會用什麼字呢?
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.080]  Stuck
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.080]  Stuck, okay,還有呢?
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.080]  What word would you use?
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.080]  VAR
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.080]  Okay
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.080]  世界盃VAR, okay
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.080]  (笑)
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.080]  我會用一個字
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.080]  就是Uncertainty
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.080]  Uncertainty, okay
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.080]  為什麼呢?因為我們還有
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.080]  一個Virus
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.080]  Coronavirus, 是不是?
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.080]  上年Omicron
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.080]  was the height of Omicron
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.080]  我那時就在
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.080]  在多倫多
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.080]  在Omicron那時,多倫多
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.080]  Okay, and then
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.080]  We had all these lockdowns, right?
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.080]  We had all these lockdowns
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.080]  有沒有人lockdown過的?
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.080]  在香港,有沒有人?
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.080]  Do you remember?
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.080]  你不知道喔,可能你的building
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080]  有幾個case,他就lockdown
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.080]  你的building
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.080]  然後又要test,又要
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.080]  isolate幾天, okay
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.080]  So it was a tough time
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.080]  of isolation
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.080]  of Coronavirus, it was not
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.080]  fun, it was not fun
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.080]  還有什麼發生?
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.080]  2月那時有什麼發生?
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.080]  有什麼發生,記不記得?
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.080]  有什麼發生?
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.080]  Big event
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.080]  in February, 有什麼發生?
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.080]  記不記得?
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.080]  Why? Chinese New Year?
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.080]  不是日語,不是這樣
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.080]  Chinese
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.080]  Okay, another big event that happened was
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.080]  Ukraine being attacked
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.080]  by
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.080]  Ukraine being attacked
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.080]  I can pretend I didn't hear that
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.080]  being attacked by Russia
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.080]  and that changed a lot of things
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.080]  that were happening in the world
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.080]  a lot of things that were happening
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.080]  in the world
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.080]  And we saw thousands of refugees
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080]  being displaced all over Europe
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.080]  And that led to the threat of a nuclear war
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.080]  And that led to the threat of a nuclear war
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.080]  There's like a threat of a nuclear war
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.080]  It's serious, right?
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.080]  Russia, US
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.080]  They have the most nuclear weapons
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.080]  in the world
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.080]  And with that comes the rise of energy prices
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.080]  And with that comes the rise of energy prices
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.080]  Energy prices
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.080]  And the stock markets went crazy
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.080]  The markets went crazy
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.080]  Housing has gone down
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.080]  There's a lot of uncertainty
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.080]  In the world
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080]  And something also very bad happened
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.080]  And something also very bad happened
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.080]  Someone very famous died
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.080]  What was her name?
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.080]  Queen Elizabeth
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.080]  Queen Elizabeth
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.080]  And she was reigning
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080]  For many, many years
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.080]  And it was a shock
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.080]  And it was a shock
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.080]  To have the queen die
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.080]  To have the queen die
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.080]  It was not all sad
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.080]  2022
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080]  It's just a lot of bad events
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.080]  It's just a lot of bad events
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.080]  There were some positive events
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.080]  Travel started to happen
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.080]  People started traveling again
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.080]  Who's traveling soon?
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.080]  Who's traveling soon?
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.080]  Where are you going?
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.080]  Barcelona?
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.080]  Ok, don't get robbed
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.080]  Where are you going?
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.080]  Canada?
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.080]  Where are you going?
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.080]  Japan
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.080]  Who's going to Japan soon?
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.080]  Everyone is going to Japan
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.080]  Or is in Japan right now
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.080]  Ok, what else happened?
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.080]  What VAR event happened?
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.080]  What VAR event happened?
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.080]  World Cup
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.080]  Who thinks it was the best
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.080]  World Cup finals ever?
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.080]  Raise your hand
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.080]  For those who didn't raise their hand
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.080]  Do you know who's the messy fan?
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.080]  Yeah, 8 billion people
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.080]  That's a lot of people
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.080]  A lot of people
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.080]  So what I would say is that
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.080]  2022 was a year of uncertainty
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.080]  There's social and political uncertainty
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.080]  There's still a lot of protests
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.080]  around the world
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.080]  There's a lot of political uncertainty around the world
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.080]  There's economical and financial uncertainty
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.080]  There's a threat of a recession
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.080]  Financial difficulty happening
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.080]  There's the global health uncertainty
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.080]  We still don't know
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.080]  How the virus is gonna end
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.080]  If it will end
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.080]  And there is the uncertainty of the environment
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.080]  Global warming
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.080]  Global warming
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.080]  And also in Jesus' time
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.080]  There was also uncertainty
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.080]  What kind of uncertainty?
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.080]  What was the major power of that time?
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.080]  It was the Roman Empire
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.080]  And so they gave uncertainty to Israel
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.080]  Because they were always a threat
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.080]  And the disciples were thinking
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.080]  Wow, Jesus is the Messiah
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.080]  He's come to save us
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.080]  But then he said he's leaving
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.080]  他去哪了?
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.080]  他說我去那裡
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.080]  你來不了
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.080]  你來不了
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.080]  為什麼來不了?
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.080]  And he says this
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.080]  He promises this to the disciples
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.080]  in the midst of uncertainty
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.080]  He says this
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.080]  Peace I leave with you
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.080]  My peace I give to you
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.080]  Not as the world gives
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.080]  Do I give to you
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.080]  Let not your hearts be troubled
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.080]  Neither let them be afraid
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.080]  And so Jesus promises peace
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.080]  平安
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.080]  你覺得平安的定義是什麼?
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.080]  What is your definition of peace?
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.080]  和你旁邊那個
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.080]  談談你覺得平安的定義是什麼?
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.080]  說一下
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.080]  Ok, what is your definition of peace?
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.080]  Ok, 我們先問這些女生

[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.080]  平衡, ok, very good
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.080]  Pierre 你們這些男生有沒有定義?

[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.080]  It looks like it
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.080]  What is peace on Google, right?
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.080]  是嗎?

[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:12.080]  我們看一下這些女生
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.080]  讓她們說定義
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.080]  哈哈哈
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.080]  What is peace?
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.080]  平安是什麼?
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.080]  Quietness
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.080]  哈哈哈
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.080]  Ok
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.080]  Ok, what about the boys?
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.080]  Lucas 你們呢?
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.080]  What is the definition of peace?
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.080]  The absence of bullying?
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.080]  哈哈哈
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.080]  Ok
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.080]  很多人呢
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.080]  覺得平安是什麼?
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.080]  是沒有conflict
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.080]  是沒有trouble的
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.080]  是嗎? The absence of conflict
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.080]  The absence of trouble
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.080]  是什麼? Relax
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.080]  好像在這個沙灘
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.080]  Relax, calm
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.080]  沒有東西煩你,是舒服的
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.080]  That is what we strive for
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.080]  in terms of this world
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.080]  and peace
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.080]  But Jesus
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.080]  He's not just saying peace
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.080]  In the Old Testament
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.080]  they would use shalom
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.080]  Ok, shalom means peace
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.080]  and they would usually greet each other
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.080]  是嗎?
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.080]  你跟人家say hello
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.080]  Hello, bye bye
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.080]  在猶太人呢
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.080]  就會說shalom, peace
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.080]  Peace be with you
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.080]  你走的時候也是shalom, peace be with you
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.080]  但耶穌呢
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.080]  不只是說bye bye
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.080]  不是只是say hello
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.080]  or bye bye
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.080]  他是說peace I leave with you
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.080]  Peace I give to you
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.080]  耶穌的平安是什麼?
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.080]  It is from him
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.080]  He's saying I give you peace
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.080]  Jesus will give you peace
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.080]  My peace I give to you
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.080]  還有呢
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.080]  這個平安不是世界的平安
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.080]  This is peace that the world cannot give
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.080]  世界的平安和耶穌的平安是不同的
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.080]  It's different
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.080]  It is different
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.080]  We learn here that Jesus provides peace
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.080]  It's personal
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.080]  and it is prized
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.080]  I have this saying here
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.080]  Peace does not come from your situation
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.080]  but from your foundation
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.080]  Peace doesn't come from your situation
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.080]  It comes from your foundation
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.080]  What does that mean?
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.080]  What does that mean?
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.080]  We're going to look at four things today
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.080]  The four things are
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.080]  The cause of peace
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.080]  The call to make peace
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.080]  The challenge of seeking peace
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.080]  in tough times
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.080]  and the consequence of peace
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.080]  What is the cause of peace?
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.080]  The cause of peace comes from the Lord
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.080]  一個神的名字是
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.080]  The Lord of Peace
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.080]  In Judges 6:24
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.080]  Gideon calls him the Lord of Peace
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.080]  耶穌的一個名字是
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.080]  The Prince of Peace
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.080]  For to us a child is born
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.080]  To us a son is given
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.080]  His name is Wonderful Counselor
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.080]  Mighty God, Everlasting Father
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.080]  The Prince of Peace
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.080]  耶穌的名字是
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.080]  The Prince of Peace
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.080]  平安在哪裏來的?
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.080]  真正的平安在天府
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.080]  在耶穌那裏
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.080]  耶穌說
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.080]  保羅說
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:44.080]  The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, and peace
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.080]  Peace comes from the Holy Spirit
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.080]  It is a product of relying on the Holy Spirit
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.080]  Peace comes from the Lord
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.080]  and is given by the Lord
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.080]  He is the cause for peace
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.080]  He is the cause for peace
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.080]  我記得我有一次
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.080]  去菲律賓
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.080]  誰去過菲律賓?
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.080]  誰去過菲律賓?
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.080]  Anybody been to the Philippines?
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.080]  Nobody? Just one person?
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.080]  Two people?
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.080]  So we were on a mission trip
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.080]  This was our mission trip
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.080]  As you see in the next slide
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.080]  We were on a mission trip
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.080]  And we went as a group
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.080]  And we had to transit
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.080]  In Manila
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.080]  Who's been to Manila?
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.080]  Who's been to Manila?
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.080]  You guys don't like the Philippines?
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.080]  Central?
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.080]  Central?
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.080]  Ok
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.080]  Ok
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.080]  So we had to transport
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.080]  a transit in the Philippines
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.080]  And what happened was
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.080]  You had to go through customs once again
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.080]  You had to go through customs once again
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.080]  We lined up
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.080]  We lined up
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.080]  to customs
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.080]  We were in a group
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.080]  We had 7 people in our team
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.080]  We were in a group
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.080]  And a guy said
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.080]  Oh no
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.080]  What do you think happened?
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.080]  Oh no
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.080]  He left his passport
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.080]  On the plane
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.080]  Has anyone left their passport on the plane?
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.080]  Has anyone left their passport on the plane?
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.080]  Rita?
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.080]  Wow
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.080]  Wow
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.080]  Passport
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.080]  Wow
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.080]  Where did you leave it?
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.080]  Where did you leave it?
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.080]  Vancouver
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.080]  Wow
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.080]  So where did this guy
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.080]  So where did this guy
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.080]  Leave his passport?
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.080]  In the front seat
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.080]  Rita, you too?
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.080]  Wow
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.080]  He left his passport
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.080]  He left his passport
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.080]  Next time
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.080]  When you fly
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.080]  Put your passport in your wallet
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.080]  Or in your bag
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.080]  Don't put it in the front
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.080]  Big mistake
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.080]  Oh no
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.080]  We have one hour left
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.080]  We have to fly
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.080]  What should we do?
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.080]  We were thinking
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.080]  Our whole team
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.080]  We were thinking
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.080]  We were thinking
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.080]  We were waiting for our passports
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.080]  We were sitting in the
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.080]  Lost and found office
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.080]  Rita, did you sit in the lost and found office?
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.080]  No?
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.080]  Oh wow
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.080]  We were sitting in the
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.080]  Lost and found office
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.080]  We were thinking
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.080]  We have a flight, it's in an hour
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.080]  Can you help us get our passports
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.080]  In the front seat
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.080]  In the front seat
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.080]  We were waiting
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.080]  20 minutes
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.080]  Till our next flight
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.080]  And then half an hour to our next flight
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.080]  And then 20 minutes
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.080]  Oh no, he comes
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.080]  We immediately got our passports
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.080]  And went to customs
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.080]  Pass through customs
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.080]  We ran to our flight
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.080]  And we made it back in time
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.080]  In that time
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.080]  We could blame this guy
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.080]  We could be very annoyed
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.080]  We could blame this guy
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.080]  We could be very annoyed
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.080]  But in that moment
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.080]  I trusted that God was in control
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.080]  It's okay
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.080]  That he left his passport
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.080]  We can just stay
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.080]  Another couple days in Manila
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.080]  We can just wait for it
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.080]  At customs
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.080]  Or we can wait for our next flight
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.080]  It's okay
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.080]  Because we know that the cause of peace
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.080]  Peace comes from God
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.080]  True peace comes from
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.080]  Knowing God is control
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.080]  It requires faith
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.080]  Not only is Jesus the cause for faith
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.080]  He calls us to make peace
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.080]  Not only is Jesus the cause for peace
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.080]  He calls us to make peace
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.080]  He says, "Blessed are the peacemakers
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.080]  For they will be called the children of God"
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.080]  Blessed are the peacemakers
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.080]  For they will be called the children of God
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.080]  Paul also says
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.080]  Finally, brothers, aim for peace
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.080]  Comfort one another
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.080]  Agree with one another
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.080]  Live in peace
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.080]  And the love and peace of God
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.080]  Will be with you
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.080]  How do we make peace?
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.080]  How do we make peace?
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.080]  Jesus is the ultimate example of making peace
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.080]  How did he make peace?
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.080]  Let's read in Ephesians chapter 2
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.080]  How Jesus made peace
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.080]  我們一起讀
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.080]  一起讀
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.080]  Ready?
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.080]  One, two, three
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:59.080]  For he, Christ himself, is our peace
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.080]  Who has made us both Jews and Gentiles one
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.080]  And has broken down in his flesh
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.080]  The dividing wall of hostility
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.080]  By abolishing the law of commandments
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.080]  Expressed in ordinances
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.080]  That he might create in himself
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.080]  One new man in place of two
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.080]  So making peace
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.080]  Jesus first made peace
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:29.080]  是什麼關係沒有平安?
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.080]  是我們和誰?
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.080]  和神的關係沒有平安
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.080]  為什麼?因為我們有
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.080]  有罪
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.080]  Because of sin
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.080]  罪的緣故
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.080]  我們和神沒有平安
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.080]  所以神就要怎樣?
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.080]  差遣耶穌去做平安
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.080]  所以神就做了平安
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.080]  透過傳送耶穌
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.080]  平安是購買的
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.080]  是個人的
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.080]  是購買在了耶穌的身上
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.080]  神和我們建立了關係
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.080]  所以首先
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.080]  神和我們建立了平安
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.080]  不僅是神和我們建立了平安
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.080]  他也和我們建立了平安
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.080]  他和我們建立了平安
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.080]  因為耶穌死了
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.080]  我們不再是猶太人和猶太人
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.080]  我們是耶穌的一體
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.080]  之前猶太人覺得他們是保證人
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.080]  他們有法律
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.080]  他們有神的祝福
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.080]  而猶太人沒有
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.080]  我們是保證人
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.080]  但是耶穌為我們死的時候
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.080]  他連接了我們
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.080]  猶太人和猶太人
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.080]  現在我們是耶穌的一體
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.080]  透過信仰
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:59.080]  耶穌也叫我們和別人做平安
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.080]  誰去過台灣?
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.080]  台灣
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.080]  你會看到在下一個圖片
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.080]  有一次我們去台灣的行程
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.080]  我們在說行程的主題
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.080]  Mavis去日本
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.080]  我剛才說了菲律賓
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.080]  現在我們說台灣
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.080]  去台灣
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.080]  我們有三個群體
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.080]  第一個群體是很活力的
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.080]  去做事
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.080]  去傳福音
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.080]  去幫人
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.080]  去和人聊天
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.080]  約新人
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.080]  有些是很正常的
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.080]  很輕鬆
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.080]  但還有一個群體是怎樣的?
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.080]  覺得很累
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.080]  經常遲到
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.080]  我有一點點病
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.080]  我晚上沒有睡覺
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.080]  我五點好像填胸圈才睡
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.080]  是嗎?
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.080]  所以怎樣?
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.080]  我們做短訊
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.080]  一個群體
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.080]  就會有什麼?
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.080]  有衝突
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.080]  是嗎?
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.080]  一個群體經常準備好
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.080]  一個群體經常遲到
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.080]  一個群體就說很累
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.080]  可不可以休息一下?
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:16.080]  可不可以去玩?
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.080]  是嗎?
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.080]  所以我們要怎樣?
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.080]  做和平
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.080]  去解決這些衝突
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.080]  去成為一個群體
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.080]  是,做和平
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.080]  神想我們和祂和其他人和平
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.080]  最後會說什麼關係?
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.080]  是和我們自己
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:47.080]  神會教導那些祂愛的人
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.080]  當祂教導我們
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.080]  就不愉快
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.080]  是嗎?
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.080]  誰喜歡被父母罵?
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.080]  誰喜歡被父母罵?
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.080]  是嗎?
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.080]  說真的嗎?
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.080]  誰喜歡被父母罵?
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.080]  為什麼他們罵我們?
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.080]  你哥哥喜歡
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.080]  我知道你哥哥喜歡
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.080]  罵多一點好一點
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.080]  誰喜歡被父母罵?
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.080]  不喜歡的
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.080]  為什麼他們罵我們?
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.080]  因為他們為我們什麼?
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.080]  為我們好
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.080]  可能那一刻我們不相信是好的
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.080]  是嗎?
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.080]  但最後我們看到
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.080]  OK,應該是好的
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.080]  應該早點睡
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.080]  應該是收拾我們的房間
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.080]  應該是不要吃那麼多糖
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.080]  是嗎?
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.080]  但在這個過程中
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.080]  被教導
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.080]  是很難的
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.080]  它說
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.080]  因此,如果有任何人在耶穌身上
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.080]  祂就是新的創造
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.080]  老的已經過世
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.080]  新的已經出現
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.080]  當耶穌讓我們新
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.080]  需要執行
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.080]  需要這個過程
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.080]  這個過程
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.080]  我們要接受自己的弱點
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.080]  軟弱
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.080]  接受我們自己有不同的試探
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.080]  挑釁
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.080]  我們需要和自己和平
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.080]  特別是在艱難的時刻
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.080]  我們要找到和平
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.080]  我們一起讀
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.080]  John 16
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.080]  我們一起讀
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.080]  一起讀
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080]  1,2,3
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.080]  我對你們說了這些話
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.080]  在我身上你們可能有和平
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.080]  在世界上你們可能有懲罰
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.080]  但請記住
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.080]  我已經克服了世界
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.080]  耶穌說什麼?
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.080]  我們這個世界會有什麼?
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.080]  懲罰
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.080]  會有困難
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.080]  會有不同的
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.080]  可能是身體上的挑戰
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.080]  可能我們有病
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.080]  受傷了
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.080]  可能我們有心理上的挑戰
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080]  可能是抑鬱
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.080]  可能是心理上的挑戰
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:15.080]  可能我們和人的關係有挑戰
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.080]  可能是世界有不同的挑戰
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.080]  但耶穌說
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.080]  祂給我們和平
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.080]  祂給我們和平
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.080]  因為祂已經克服了世界
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:35.080]  我記得有一次
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.080]  在夏天的時候
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.080]  我撐著艇
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.080]  在香港有誰曾經開過海盜艇?
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.080]  有,很棒
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.080]  你們可以看到
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.080]  海盜艇和海灘的這張圖片
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.080]  我開海盜艇的時候
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.080]  在一個營裡
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.080]  我和小朋友一起開海盜艇的時候
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.080]  他就有一個想法
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.080]  這個想法是什麼呢?
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.080]  我們反船
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.080]  Pastor Johnny的船
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.080]  反船
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.080]  最後他們六七個
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.080]  就反船了
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:16.080]  我的電話是一個水證件
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.080]  但這個水證件
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.080]  吊在我的頸上
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.080]  我就把它脫掉
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.080]  因為海盜艇的時候
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.080]  這個風就會很大
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.080]  很煩
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.080]  我就把它脫掉
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.080]  他反船的時候
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.080]  我的電話就
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.080]  升了下去
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.080]  我們在梅窩
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.080]  有沒有人去過梅窩?
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.080]  水清不清?
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.080]  是最不清的
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.080]  最不清的
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.080]  OK?
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.080]  是最濕的水
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.080]  不知道有什麼水池
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.080]  一反船
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.080]  你掌握著空氣
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.080]  你的海盜艇就被翻轉了
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.080]  你只是想拿空氣
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.080]  然後
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.080]  我的電話不是在浮動
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.080]  是在滲水
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.080]  我就說糟糕了
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.080]  電話沒了
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.080]  然後波浪又很大
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.080]  我們就開始浮來浮去
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.080]  潛下去就看不到東西
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.080]  又不知道潛到
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.080]  電話的最初位置
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.080]  不知道在哪裡
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.080]  在這個情況下
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.080]  可以怪責小朋友
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.080]  為什麼小朋友翻我的海盜艇
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.080]  可以怪責我自己
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.080]  為什麼不馬上拿著我的電話
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.080]  可以怪責神
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.080]  神啊
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.080]  為什麼我在這裡的營裡去侍奉
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.080]  但是有這個情況發生
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.080]  為什麼
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.080]  我可以做很多事情
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.080]  但我接受了這個情況
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.080]  我接受了神有更好的計劃
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.080]  祂不想我那週末
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.080]  拿著電話
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.080]  我把我的安慰
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.080]  我的信任
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.080]  交給了神
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.080]  祂會照顧我
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.080]  我每次的約會
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.080]  祂會照顧我
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.080]  我每次的擔憂
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.080]  我會有安慰
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:19.080]  後來有人付了我新的電話
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.080]  哇
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.080]  有人付了我新的電話
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.080]  所以神給了我
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.080]  神給了我
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.080]  我不是說如果你丟掉電話
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.080]  神會給你新的電話
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.080]  然後有人會付錢給你
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.080]  我不知道阿姨Winnie
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.080]  或者阿姨Rita會不會付錢給你
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.080]  她可能不會
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.080]  但是我說
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.080]  如果你相信神
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.080]  總有一天
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.080]  事情會變好
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.080]  你會有安慰
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.080]  讓我們來評論
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.080]  神想我們和祂有安慰
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.080]  這是一個上升的關係
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.080]  神想我們和其他人有安慰
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.080]  這是一個上升的關係
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.080]  神想我們和自己有安慰
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.080]  特別是在艱難的時刻
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.080]  但是如果你和神的關係沒有安慰
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.080]  這會影響你所有的關係
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.080]  如果你和神的關係沒有真正的平安
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:28.080]  你所有的關係都會受到影響
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.080]  和平不是來自你的情況
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.080]  而是來自你的基礎
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.080]  你的基礎必須是神
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.080]  我們如何能夠有安慰
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.080]  在艱難的時刻
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:47.080]  我們必須確保我們的基礎堅強
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.080]  耶穌說
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.080]  不要在沙上建造你的房子
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.080]  建造在石頭上
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.080]  因為如果建造在沙上
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.080]  如果你看到最後一張照片
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.080]  那是一個石頭上的房子
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.080]  如果這個房子在沙上
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.080]  會發生什麼事
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.080]  會發生什麼事
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.080]  會發生什麼事
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.080]  如果這個房子在沙上
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.080]  在最後一刻會發生什麼事
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:21.080]  這個房子會進入海洋
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.080]  會進入海洋
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:28.080]  耶穌告訴我們要建造我們的房子在石頭上
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.080]  我們要找到我們的平安
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.080]  在一個堅強的基礎上
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.080]  我會邀請樂隊上台
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.080]  我們要閉上眼睛
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.080]  我們要想想
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.080]  基礎是什麼
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.080]  我們閉上眼睛
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.080]  現在是你和神之間
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.080]  基礎是什麼
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.080]  你的平安基礎是什麼
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:02.080]  是你的等級嗎
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.080]  因為如果你的等級高了
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.080]  你會有平安
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080]  如果你的等級低了
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.080]  你不會有平安
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.080]  你會有多少人喜歡你
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.080]  或者追蹤你
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.080]  在Instagram上
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.080]  因為人們會來
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.080]  人們會走
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.080]  如果我們建立我們的基礎
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.080]  我們的平安
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:30.080]  在不堪一擊的事情上
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.080]  我們永遠都會上下走
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:39.080]  如果我們把平安放在永恆上
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.080]  神永不變
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.080]  祂愛我們
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:49.080]  祂稱呼我們為和平的建築
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.080]  祂就是我們的平安
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.080]  我們就真的會有平安
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.080]  我不知道你們在過什麼
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.080]  我們在2022年結束後
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.080]  開始新的一年
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.080]  你們可能會有很多擔憂
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.080]  可能會有考試
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.080]  可能會有家庭關係
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.080]  可能會有朋友關係
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.080]  可能會有個人的苦難
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.080]  可能會在找平安的時候
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.080]  在找到平安的時候
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.080]  我今天要挑戰你們
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.080]  在找到平安的時候
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.080]  在找到平安的時候
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.080]  因為祂在乎你們
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.080]  祂愛你們
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.080]  祂愛你們這麼多
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.080]  祂在你們身上死了
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.080]  祂愛你們
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.080]  祂想讓你們有平安
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.080]  祂想讓你們有平安
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.080]  祂不想讓你們依賴自己或別人
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.080]  祂想讓你們依賴祂
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.080]  祂想讓你們有平安
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:52.080]  你們會相信祂嗎?
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.080]  將你的信念放在祂身上
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:59.080]  讓祂成為你們的平安
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:04.080]  是世界無法給予的平安
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.080]  讓我們祈禱
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.080]  神父
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.080]  我們感謝禰
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.080]  禰是我們的平安
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.080]  我們感謝禰
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.080]  禰是平安的源頭
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.080]  平安的起源
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.080]  禰叫我們和禰和其他人和自己
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.080]  一起做平安
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.080]  在我們的弱點
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.080]  在我們面對困難的時刻
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.080]  幫助我們,主
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.080]  和我們一起
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.080]  我們在名字的神父的名下祈禱
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.080]  阿們
