1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 That was good scripture reading.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,280
 I mean, the reason that we get someone to read the scripture is because the words are

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,360
 so hard, right?

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,120
 So let's get someone else to do it so we don't have to do it.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,240
 No, no, no, no.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,120
 But it's good to always read the scripture in which we are about to look at together

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,120
 in full.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,760
 Now, today we won't have time to actually go through every single verse in detail, but

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,720
 we will get to see at least verse one to eight in detail.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,760
 So previous weeks we've been looking at 2 Timothy and do you remember what we've been

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,920
 going through?

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,080
 It was to guard, to work, to continue.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,040
 So these are the three weeks leading up to what we're speaking on today.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,880
 And today, as you've just seen, we're going to talk about to preach.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,680
 Now how many of you have had the chance where you're responsible for something?

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,040
 And so when you had to leave that job or that particular responsibility, you had to pass

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,760
 it on to someone else.

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
 How many of us have done that?

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,200
 I mean, maybe when you've left a job or maybe when you're in a student committee and you're

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,680
 in a club, right?

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,120
 You had to do that.

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,840
 And so this is what's happening here.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,600
 Now I remember my last job when I had to leave, I was responsible for a particular program.

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,200
 And what I did was I cherished that because it was kind of like my baby.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,920
 I started that program.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,800
 So what I did was I wrote a manual making sure that everything was detaily written down.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,960
 And I don't know about you, but I always save files on my desktop.

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,840
 So I have about 200 of them just randomly saved, right?

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,680
 Am I the only one who does that?

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,000
 Pretty sure I'm not.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,360
 So I went to just rename everything and put everything back.

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,720
 And so we kind of see that's what Paul's kind of doing with Timothy.

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,280
 He's telling him all these things because he knows that he's about to be persecuted.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,760
 And so he needs to make sure that, "Hey, Timothy, get this, do this, to do this."

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,880
 And now we're at the very last part where he's telling us to preach.

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,640
 So today that's what we're going to be looking at.

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,280
 So what we see is he wastes no time.

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,840
 And let's look at the verse together.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,920
 In verse one and two it says, "In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge

40
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,160
 the living and the dead, and in view of His appearing and His kingdom, I give you this

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
 charge.

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,560
 Preach the word, be prepared in season and out of season, correct rebuke and encourage,

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
 with great patience and careful instructions."

44
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,600
 Now when I see that he wastes no time is because right in verse one he says, "In the presence

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,000
 of God and Christ Jesus."

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,880
 Now how often do you tell someone something and say, "Hey, you know what I'm about to

47
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,160
 tell you?

48
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,680
 God is right here testifying."

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,220
 We don't hear that a lot.

50
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,280
 So we know that whatever it is he's about to say is so important that he is calling

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,320
 out for God and Jesus' witness for them to be there.

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,960
 So we should have our ears up and ready to hear what he wants to say.

53
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,800
 And what's more is he's highlighting the fact that he is the judge who is to judge the living

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
 and the dead.

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,680
 I mean, think about it, Paul had like many other descriptions that he could have described

56
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,880
 God at this moment.

57
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,040
 He could have called him the Holy One or the everlasting Father, but he doesn't.

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,440
 He calls him the judge of the living and the dead.

59
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,840
 So that kind of gives us a clue that whatever he's about to say has some sort of eternal

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
 effect.

61
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,920
 It's not just about any random things, but it has a very heavy eternal effect.

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,760
 So with that, that's the kind of intensity we should be having as we read this.

63
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,480
 And now of course he says, "Preach the word, be prepared in season and out of season, correct

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,800
 rebuke and encourage."

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,320
 Now what do most of us, when we hear the word preach, what's your first respond?

66
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
 Huh?

67
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
 Pastor.

68
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,640
 You're like, "All right, it's time for me to snooze and close my ears because this has

69
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,600
 nothing to do with me.

70
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,920
 It's for the one who stands on the pulpit or the teacher in front of class, or maybe

71
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,280
 you know my clan leader, they do a bit of teaching as well.

72
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,320
 But what does it have to do with me?

73
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
 I'm not preaching anything."

74
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,800
 That's what we usually think.

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,560
 But the word preach was never just associated with the pastors or the teachers.

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:35,360
 In fact, the word preach just meant to declare something, to declare out, to speak out.

77
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,160
 And right now Paul's asking not only Timothy, but for all of us to speak out the word of

78
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,360
 the truth, which is what's in the Bible and also who Jesus is.

79
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,840
 So don't tune out because it's for all of us.

80
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:57,520
 And it's so crucial that Paul at the very beginning is saying, "I'm saying this, literally

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,680
 on behalf of God and Christ Jesus, preach the word."

82
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,360
 Now this is not the only verb because actually all of these five highlighted verbs are actually

83
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
 imperatives.

84
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,240
 So which means in Greek, it's really a command and all five of these are together, except

85
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,280
 we don't want to make a title that says to preach, to prepare, to correct and rebuke

86
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,040
 and to encourage.

87
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,520
 That's a really long title.

88
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,360
 But what it's really saying is that we need to do all of these things.

89
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,160
 And so the first point that I want to bring out is that we need to preach with your words

90
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,680
 in speech.

91
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,600
 This is a crucial part that Paul is asking us as well as Timothy to do, is that we need

92
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,000
 to speak out.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,800
 Remember in the last verse, it says it's to correct, to rebuke.

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,160
 So you're not just speaking at any opportunity, but one that when people are misaligned with

95
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,680
 the truth, we need to correct them.

96
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,160
 Now when does that happen?

97
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,240
 You kind of see it sometimes maybe with your coworkers, they might start to have some marital

98
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,880
 affairs that you're aware of, right?

99
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,040
 And so you want to speak up at that time.

100
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,800
 Or you might see someone, your friends might be depressed to a point where they think that

101
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,720
 they're worthless.

102
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,960
 And in that moment, you want to speak the truth to them and say, "No, Jesus loves you.

103
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,200
 God loves you.

104
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,640
 And there's hope."

105
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,680
 And these are the time when we need to correct and rebuke them.

106
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,400
 Because as we see these people around us, you and I have actually very different audiences.

107
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,840
 Your friends and family may be people that I or Christina or like Philemon will never

108
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,040
 get to, and only you would.

109
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,240
 And so we need to be on our guard.

110
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:54,720
 And it says here that in season, out of season, which means that it's any time, any time,

111
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,040
 we need to be ready for it.

112
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,280
 And we need to correct and rebuke.

113
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,280
 And yet it has something at the end, which is to encourage with patience.

114
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,800
 So we need to preach with our words, with our speech.

115
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,000
 And so let's read on.

116
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,880
 I mean, what's the reason for preaching or correcting the people that are around us?

117
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,680
 And it says here in verse three, "For the time will come when people will not put up

118
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,400
 with sound doctrine.

119
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,720
 Instead to suit their own desires, they would gather around them a great number of teachers

120
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,760
 to say what their itching ears want to hear.

121
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,680
 They would turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths."

122
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,640
 Now, so Paul tells us that the very reason that we need to speak out the truth is because

123
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,160
 people don't want to hear.

124
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,360
 I mean, how many people want to hear, I mean, for me, it's my mother who always says the

125
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,640
 right thing, which is like, "Eat your vegetables, sleep early."

126
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,360
 I mean, I know Mel's a mom now, and she's probably starting to do that as well, right?

127
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,040
 So I mean, how many of us want to be surrounded by people who keep telling us what to do the

128
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
 right things?

129
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,200
 Okay, there's like one hand.

130
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,000
 I mean, no, we don't.

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,320
 We don't want to be surrounded by like, "Don't tell me.

132
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,400
 Yes, I know.

133
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
 Don't tell me."

134
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,320
 And however, this is a time when Paul says, "No, don't stop.

135
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,960
 They will turn away from the truth.

136
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,760
 They don't want to hear it, but keep preaching and speaking about it."

137
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,000
 And so as we read on in verse five, he says, "But you," speaking to Timothy, "keep your

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,080
 head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of the evangelist, discharge all

139
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,520
 the duties of your ministry."

140
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:52,600
 So when we hear the word, "But you," we know that he's separating Timothy and hopefully

141
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,280
 all of us away from those false teacher, which we've been looking at for the last few chapters

142
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,400
 of how they just want to say things that people want to hear.

143
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,600
 But he's saying here, "But you, Timothy, and all of us, don't do that.

144
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
 Keep your heads up."

145
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
 What does it mean?

146
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,880
 I mean, it's not like, "Don't speak like this."

147
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,400
 I'm pretty sure that's not what he meant.

148
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:21,080
 When it means keep your heads up, it means spiritually and mentally be aware.

149
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,840
 That's the very first step.

150
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,480
 Because you need to first be aware that the people around you, what their needs are, and

151
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,320
 what kind of ways they're going astray before you can tell them.

152
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,040
 And when you tell them what happens, the reason we're seeing endure hardship is because when

153
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,920
 you approach someone and you want to correct or rebuke them, well, I want to say, "Maybe

154
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,600
 nothing nice will happen."

155
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
 Well, maybe not nothing, but sometimes nice things don't happen.

156
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,400
 They might repel you and they might reject you.

157
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,680
 And so in here it says, "Endure and continue to evangelize.

158
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,000
 Discharge all duties."

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,800
 So what we see here really is just Paul asking us and Timothy, "Go out, preach the word,"

160
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,480
 because people don't want to hear it.

161
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,400
 They're swayed from the truth, and yet they need to be corrected, rebuked, but with a

162
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,960
 kind of gentleness and patience.

163
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,040
 So now as we read on, we realize that Timothy turns away from this instruction.

164
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,440
 And instead, he begins to have this self-disposure.

165
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,600
 He's exposing himself and he says, "For I am already being poured out like a drink offering,

166
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,720
 and the time for my departure is near.

167
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,160
 I have fought the good fight.

168
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,680
 I've finished the race.

169
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,920
 I've kept the faith."

170
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:48,480
 Now all of a sudden, Paul pauses and says, "Hey, Timothy, look at me.

171
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,640
 Look at what I've been doing.

172
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,280
 I am being poured out like a drink offering."

173
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,560
 Now what is a drink offering?

174
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,560
 A drink offering was a kind of worship that was combined with usually a burnt sacrifice.

175
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,800
 And it's a way for them to worship deities in the Old Testament.

176
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,920
 And so in a way, Paul is saying, "Look at me.

177
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,520
 I am pouring out my life.

178
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:24,720
 I am not keeping any bits to myself to a point where I'm about to die for what I believe

179
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,800
 in."

180
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,160
 And so what kind of preaching is that?

181
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:36,160
 And this brings us to our second point, which is that we need to preach with our actions.

182
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,580
 Now we all know the saying, "Action speaks louder than words," right?

183
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,920
 And it's not very credible when you say one thing and do something else.

184
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,200
 And I'm sure those with kids, you're going to hear them probably say, "Mommy and Daddy,

185
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,960
 why are you doing it?"

186
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,160
 Whatever it is that you have said, they will ask you, "Why are you doing it?"

187
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,240
 And that's when we have to be very-- I mean, I'm not a parent yet, but that's when the

188
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,000
 parents have to be very creative to think of ways, "Why am I doing it?"

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,040
 And so in a very similar way, if we're going to preach the gospel and who God is, and if

190
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,600
 we say that God is someone who will provide, and yet we're always the anxious one.

191
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,200
 We're always the one that is fidgeting, "Oh, I can't sleep well because this is happening

192
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,560
 to me."

193
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,440
 That's not going to be a very credible or a convincing message, right?

194
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,800
 Or if you have fought your way into church, you know how-- not me, I mean, not the people

195
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,400
 here, but I'm sure some people would fight their way to church.

196
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,760
 "Hey, I told you to put it there."

197
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,840
 "No, I didn't say."

198
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,400
 And the moment that you see someone, it's like, "Oh, hello.

199
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,560
 Good evening," as if nothing's happening.

200
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,800
 But then the people around us, the closest ones, will see the hypocrisy of that, right?

201
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,960
 So we need to preach without action as well.

202
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,720
 So now as we read on to verse 8, it says, "Now there is in store for me the crown of

203
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,760
 righteousness which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not

204
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:13,320
 only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing."

205
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,880
 Now you see, in this verse, we really see what is it that Paul is focusing on.

206
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,760
 He's not-- I mean, maybe I think for me, if I'm about to die, I'm just going to think

207
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,400
 about, "Oh my goodness, is that going to be very painful?

208
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,840
 How are they going to kill me?

209
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,320
 What's it going to be like?"

210
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,920
 But for him, it was none of that.

211
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,440
 His eyes was just fixated on one thing and one thing only.

212
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,680
 And what was that?

213
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:48,800
 He's going to see God with his very own eyes very soon, any moment.

214
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,920
 And that there's this crown of righteousness that's waiting for him.

215
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,280
 And so his eyes is on that goal of meeting Christ.

216
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:06,280
 And so this brings us to our third point, which is that we need to preach and tell people,

217
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:13,080
 but with one goal, and that is to please the Lord that we will see one day.

218
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,920
 Now, you know what's the difference between preaching with this goal and preaching with

219
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
 other goals?

220
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,760
 I mean, it's kind of like if we were to do something, let's say we even want to evangelize

221
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:32,320
 to someone, and we focus on rather or not that person believed in God, if that was our

222
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:41,760
 goal to try to bring people to Christ, what happens after maybe 50 people does not?

223
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,960
 We get discouraged.

224
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:50,680
 Or maybe if we are worshiping God with our voice or other talents, and yet we don't get

225
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,560
 that appreciation from other people.

226
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:04,560
 If our eyes were not fixed on just pleasing God, but on other things, then it's very easy

227
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
 to be discouraged.

228
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:15,200
 And so here we need to preach with this goal, which is to see our God one day.

229
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,040
 And if we have that goal fixated in our hearts, then regardless of what hardship, what disappointment

230
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,280
 we have, we can and will be able to continue.

231
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,080
 And so now, I don't know if you remember verse 17, I don't have it here.

232
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:38,120
 17 and 18 actually tells us that Paul's reason for being able to press on other than the

233
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,960
 goal is the fact that he is strengthened by the Lord all the time.

234
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,680
 And that's why he also has that confidence saying that he has fought the fight.

235
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,220
 And so we need to be encouraged just the way that Paul is.

236
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,840
 If we fixate our eyes on Jesus, then we can press on.

237
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:05,480
 And when we see him, we can tell God that we've done our very best to give our very

238
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,600
 every ounce that we have.

239
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:16,400
 And so today I want to share a story with you about a man named Brad Cohen.

240
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:26,960
 He is an extraordinary man and his life story has actually been put into a movie.

241
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:34,120
 And what we see here is that his life wasn't an ordinary one.

242
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,360
 It's called Front of the Class, that's the movie it's been made into.

243
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,780
 And what happened was even when he was young, he would have these tics where he has these

244
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,280
 movements where he would repeatedly do it and he would make this sound kind of like

245
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,240
 animals sound like quack, quack, quack, you know.

246
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,600
 And it would constantly be very disturbing for those in class.

247
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,720
 And it was so disturbing that the teachers would ask him to come to the front of the

248
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,400
 class and apologize to everyone and say that he would never do it again.

249
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,440
 And so of course he said he won't do it again, but he can't control it.

250
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,700
 So he would continue to do it and be disciplined in many ways.

251
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,040
 And so the students kind of follow suit.

252
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,500
 If the teachers are cruel, the students will also be.

253
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,020
 And so he was bullied all the time at school and he had no friends.

254
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,180
 But he had a loving mother who went to the library and she searched up what is going

255
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,160
 on with this son.

256
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,800
 And they came to realize that it's called a Tourette syndrome.

257
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:43,600
 And this syndrome is actually where it's like a neural malfunction, maldevelopment in which

258
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,360
 that's the way he is and he can't control it.

259
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,960
 And there is no cure for it.

260
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,520
 And so what we see is that over the time that he was at school, he was constantly being

261
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,260
 bullied and he was disturbing class and even when he was in high school.

262
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,680
 And he was disturbing everyone to a point where he was sent to the principal.

263
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:12,800
 And then the principal asked, "Why don't you come to join the school concert?"

264
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,080
 And he was like, "Oh, no, no, no.

265
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,760
 I can't go to the school concert.

266
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,120
 I'm going to make all these sounds."

267
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,520
 And he was like, "No, no, it's okay.

268
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,280
 Why don't you just come?"

269
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,440
 Being encouraged by the principal, he said, "Okay, okay, I'll go."

270
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,760
 I mean, he really wanted to go, but he just wasn't sure if he could.

271
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,320
 So when he was there at the concert, of course he made these quacking noises in which it

272
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
 was disturbing.

273
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,200
 So at the very end, the principal did something very strange.

274
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,160
 He went up on stage and he asked everyone, "Did you guys hear some noise during the concert?"

275
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,000
 And of course, everyone nodded and said, "Yeah, we heard it."

276
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,800
 And he said, "Would the person who made that noise please come up to the stage?"

277
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,680
 And so he was walking up on the stage and he thought, "Oh my goodness, either I would

278
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,700
 be humiliated even more or I would have to apologize to the entire school.

279
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,800
 But whatever it is, he was ready for it."

280
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,000
 And so the principal asked him, he was like, "Were you the one making the noise?"

281
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,480
 He said, "Yes, I was the one."

282
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,000
 He said, "Why are you making that noise?"

283
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,920
 So he started explaining what this Tourette's syndrome was all about and how involuntary

284
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,800
 it was for him.

285
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,920
 And so the principal asked, "So you didn't really want to make these sounds, did you?"

286
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,400
 And then he said, "No."

287
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,080
 "And it's not curable, is it?"

288
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,280
 And he said, "No."

289
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:40,760
 So being kind of even more ashamed now of who he was and what he was doing, he was slowly

290
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,960
 walking down and thinking, "What is going to happen of me now?"

291
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,640
 And to his surprise, every single person started clapping and applauding him.

292
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,000
 And everybody stood up and was just encouraging him.

293
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,800
 And for the very first time, he said that he felt accepted for just who he was.

294
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,120
 And it was in that moment that he said, "I am going to become a teacher."

295
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,560
 The teacher that he never had.

296
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,920
 And so he continued schooled and throughout his university, he got wonderful grades, like

297
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,320
 outstanding ones, and even got recommendations.

298
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,960
 So then he began to look for a job as a teacher.

299
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,120
 Sometimes after interviews, he did not get a job.

300
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,640
 And every time he would explain to them what this syndrome was, trying to tell them that

301
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,760
 it was okay, I could control myself, but none of the schools would give him a chance.

302
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,920
 And 24 interviews he went through, he did not get a job.

303
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:53,600
 And so out of frustration and anger, he just didn't know what to do.

304
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,760
 But he pressed on.

305
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,800
 In his 25th interview, there was an assistant principal who, after the interview, said,

306
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,600
 "You know, you're like the best guy.

307
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,460
 You're exactly what we need."

308
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,960
 And so she went to the principal and told him, "Hey, I've got this guy."

309
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,480
 The principal though was extremely hesitant.

310
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,720
 And he said, "I'm not sure if we can convince the parents that he's a good fit."

311
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,480
 And you know what, the assistant principal said something.

312
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,160
 She said, "We can't just talk the talk.

313
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,880
 We need to walk the talk.

314
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,840
 And we need to show the students and the parents that it's okay to hire someone, even with

315
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,400
 disability."

316
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,720
 And with that, they hired him.

317
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,680
 And that year, actually, the state of Georgia awarded him the award, which is the Teacher

318
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,280
 of the First Year award.

319
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,180
 And not only that, but he slowly became a motivational speaker.

320
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:01,440
 He also became an author, and he added his own family with two kids.

321
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,680
 And now he's even the school administrator.

322
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,000
 And during once an Oprah show, he was being interviewed.

323
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,880
 And Oprah asked him, "Was there ever a moment when you wanted to give up?

324
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,440
 What do you think the answer is, yes or no?"

325
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
 Yes.

326
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
 And all of you nodding your head.

327
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,720
 And you know what his answer was?

328
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
 "Never."

329
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,080
 He said, "Never."

330
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:40,720
 Because he knew that he had to be that teacher, which would walk with the students that were

331
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,080
 different.

332
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,920
 And his eyes were fixated on that so much.

333
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:53,200
 And never for a moment, even after the 24 interviews, did he want to give up.

334
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,680
 Now why do I share this story with you, Brad Cohen, this wonderful man?

335
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,920
 Is because I really think that we ought to preach like all the people that were in his

336
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,520
 stories.

337
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,120
 And it was actually a real life story.

338
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:16,920
 I mean, imagine for a moment that the first principal, if he did not correct the student

339
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:23,800
 body, if he did not preach through a kind of gentleness, encouraging him to tell the

340
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:32,520
 student body what was happening to him, where would Brad be if there weren't that principal?

341
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:39,600
 Or if there weren't the other, the assistant principal, where she went and told the principal,

342
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,680
 we need to give this guy a chance.

343
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,080
 We can't just say, you know, school is equal, there's no racism, and there's no discrimination.

344
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,000
 We can't just say that and not do it.

345
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,280
 If she didn't do that, where would Brad be?

346
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,000
 In the same way, if Brad did not persist, if he did not have his eyes fixated on the

347
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,280
 fact that he needed to be that teacher.

348
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,520
 I mean, all of us, including myself, I would have nodded my head.

349
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,600
 I would have given up at some point.

350
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,280
 But he didn't, because he fixated on something.

351
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,400
 And that's what I wanted to share with us today, that when we preach, when we say that

352
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,320
 we're preaching, it's actually any time, like that principal, it can happen in any way.

353
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,000
 Maybe someone's being bullied.

354
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,120
 We need to go out and find out what's happening.

355
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
 You know, why is he being bullied?

356
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,480
 Or if someone's sad around us, we need to go and find out, hey, what's happening?

357
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,080
 Is there something we can do?

358
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:43,840
 We need to be preaching the word, both correcting it if it's wrong with our speech, and also

359
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,440
 with the action that we are showing the people around them.

360
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:57,720
 And last of all, I mean, Brad Cohen was fixated on the fact that he needed to be that teacher,

361
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
 right?

362
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,680
 So all of us can actually come up with some sort of vow or some sort of-- how should I

363
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,880
 say it?

364
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,720
 Some sort of thing that we would hang on to.

365
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:21,000
 But it's very different than hanging on to God, because God is an eternal God.

366
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,960
 And He's able, and He will give us this eternal reward, which is very different from all the

367
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,080
 other vows that we could ever have.

368
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:40,880
 I'm just showing you this to say that if Brad Cohen can hold on to something like a vow,

369
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,640
 shouldn't we all the more hold on to what the Bible told us, which is that one day we

370
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,760
 will see God face to face?

371
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,880
 And one day we will need to be accountable.

372
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:58,320
 When he asked, where were all the talents that I gave you when you had the chance to

373
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,540
 preach to the people around you of the truth?

374
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,300
 Maybe they don't know about Jesus yet.

375
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,180
 Maybe they do know, and yet they've turned away.

376
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:13,920
 Maybe they haven't experienced the kind of God that you have experienced.

377
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,520
 Will we go to them?

378
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,800
 And with our actions, will we live up to it?

379
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:27,440
 I mean, it is hard to live up to it, because even if we hear some injustice today in the

380
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,240
 world-- I think Philemon and I today were earlier hearing the news about some injustice

381
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,880
 that were happening.

382
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,540
 And then I think he was challenging me and saying, hey, would you go and do something

383
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,600
 about that?

384
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,240
 And honestly, I had to say, well, I'm not sure.

385
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,680
 I'm not sure, because sometimes I'm afraid.

386
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,360
 If I do something about it, I might get boycotted.

387
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,080
 I might get into trouble.

388
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,800
 I might have people that will dislike me all the more.

389
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:03,560
 And yet I think it's those times that we ought to think, wait a minute.

390
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,560
 Am I only living for the temporal?

391
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,880
 Or am I living for the eternal?

392
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,280
 And if it is, then let them boycott, and so be it.

393
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:24,600
 And if it is really for eternity, then the temporal things should not matter.

394
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,040
 And I charge you, and I challenge you and myself.

395
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,520
 I think fear is usually the thing that come into place.

396
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,080
 Rather or not, we'll take that extra step.

397
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:44,880
 And I pray that we'll be like Paul, who in prison, in his last moments, still continues

398
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,440
 his work.

399
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,640
 And he continues to a way where he's going to give up his life just to continue and say

400
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:05,920
 that he believes everything that Jesus said he did, that he did rise from the dead.

401
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:12,720
 And he will give us this eternal righteous crown.

402
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,920
 So I really urge all of us to preach the word in the workplace that you're in, in the school

403
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:26,280
 that you're in, in your family, to live it out, to preach it.

404
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:32,960
 And with one goal in mind, that we will see God one day.

405
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:41,600
 And I really hope that all of us will be like Paul, being able to say that I poured out

406
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:49,120
 my life as a drink offering, and that I have fought the good fight of faith.

407
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,600
 I have kept the faith.

408
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,600
 I have finished the race.

409
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:03,600
 And I pray that this is something that we can say, because only you will know if you

410
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,200
 have done that.

411
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,640
 So let us pray together.

412
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:20,160
 Dear Heavenly Father, we pray that you continue to stir in us with your spirit, your truth

413
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,400
 and your word.

414
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,920
 And Father, many a times we do get scared.

415
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:32,800
 We do get scared and we can't live up to what we say we believe in.

416
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:39,760
 And yet, Father, we pray that we will be bold like Apostle Paul, that with your spirit and

417
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:48,760
 with you giving us strength and knowing that you will rescue us into your heavenly realm.

418
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,680
 With that assurance, Father, may we live a very different life.

419
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,760
 May we speak up when you ask us to.

420
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:04,640
 May we live up with every moment of our action.

421
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,720
 And may we never lose sight of eternity and what you have promised to us.

422
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,660
 We pray, Father, that you would help us, strengthen us every day.

423
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,600
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

424
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,040
 Amen.
