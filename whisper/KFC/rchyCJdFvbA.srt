1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
 - Well, thanks so much, Pastor John.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:14,820
 I was so impressed when I heard that you were doing a sermon series on serving and really

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:22,320
 thinking intentionally for almost two months about how you can serve the community.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,120
 And I was especially grateful to John for giving me the invitation because serving the

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:35,360
 community is truly at the heart of Mother's Choice.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,400
 And that's because when I think about that more than 30 years ago, when my parents and

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,600
 their friends from our church, the same church where Pastor John prayed for me all those

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,280
 decades ago, they started Mother's Choice and it's really, they were just volunteers,

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,760
 just regular people in the community.

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,520
 Nobody really had a professional background, but they were just people in our church family

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,000
 who wanted to respond to the deep need in our city of babies and children who don't

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,360
 have families and pregnant teenagers.

13
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:23,680
 And now 36 years after the start of Mother's Choice, we have an average of 900 volunteers

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,160
 a month, and they're mostly people from our church community, including people who are

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,200
 in this room tonight.

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,640
 I'm so touched to see you here.

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,960
 So I just want to say, I think that there's a movement.

18
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,760
 There's something happening here in our city where people want to care about the lonely

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,340
 and the vulnerable.

20
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:53,120
 And I have seen firsthand the power of serving the community.

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,000
 And I think for us as Christians, it's more than just something powerful.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,920
 It's actually our calling.

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:08,120
 I'm so blown away to hear those young people speak out the words from Jesus himself, that

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,640
 this is what our calling is.

25
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,640
 This is our purpose.

26
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,760
 This is why we're here on the planet.

27
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,560
 But I think it takes something for us to pause, and that's really what you've been doing through

28
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:27,760
 this series, to ask ourselves the question, how do we actually serve our community?

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,880
 And if you remember one thing that I tell you tonight, I want you to remember this.

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,000
 Serving our community looks like family.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
 So I'm not going to speak too long tonight.

32
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,680
 I'm mostly just going to tell you some stories.

33
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
 But I want to break that simple sentence down.

34
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,600
 And I'm going to start with the word serving first.

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,640
 What does it actually mean to serve?

36
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,720
 If you look it up in the dictionary, of course, it says it means to work for, to do good for,

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,200
 to help.

38
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,800
 And the Bible tells us, and you can see this verse from the Gospel of Mark, but the Bible

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,440
 tells us that we are called to serve one another.

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,640
 To work for, to do good for, to help others, not just ourselves.

41
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:28,040
 Now, I'm talking about serving the family, and you can see behind me here in a moment,

42
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,080
 this is my family.

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,480
 Yeah.

44
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
 That's right.

45
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,120
 It's a little bit unusual in Hong Kong, but believe it or not, I was born and raised right

46
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,720
 here in Hong Kong in a family of seven children.

47
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,640
 And now I have seven children.

48
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,240
 But I have six boys and one baby girl.

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:57,280
 And speaking of serving and family, I was just really touched.

50
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,320
 I think God has a sense of humor that the Cambodia youth mission trip, we're here sharing

51
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,560
 their testimony today.

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,220
 Because just a few weeks ago, I agreed to go on my own church's youth and family service

53
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,400
 trip to the Philippines with my oldest son, Paxton.

54
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:24,200
 Now he's 12 and a half, and he really, really wanted me to go with him.

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:34,160
 The challenge was, and I'm being really open with you here, I really didn't want to go.

56
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,000
 I did not want to go on the youth mission trip to serve others.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,640
 I'll be honest with you.

58
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,760
 Things have been hard for me.

59
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,720
 And I have a feeling they've probably been hard for some of you in this room too.

60
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,600
 Now especially for me where I work, I work at Mother's Choice.

61
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,720
 And the reality is the last couple of years, it's been three years since the last time

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,400
 I preached here at KFCI.

63
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,160
 But the last three years have been really hard years.

64
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,640
 And the reality is that Hong Kong, even though the COVID restrictions have been lifted, Hong

65
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,720
 Kong is actually facing a child protection crisis.

66
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,360
 And our work serving children and pregnant teenagers has never been more difficult.

67
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,480
 And if I'm being really open with you, I've been feeling really tired and maybe even a

68
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,440
 little burned out and discouraged.

69
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,240
 And feeling like does our work, does our service even make a difference?

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,960
 But I knew, my son who's about to become a teenager, I knew that this was really important

71
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
 to him.

72
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,520
 It's a pivotal time in his life.

73
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,680
 And I knew that I needed to say yes.

74
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,760
 So I said yes, but another true confession here, I didn't read the bulletin that said

75
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,600
 where we were going or what we were doing.

76
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,000
 I just, my son kept telling me to send the money in.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,720
 So I wrote the check.

78
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,280
 I signed the permission slip.

79
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,360
 I sent photocopies of our passport.

80
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,640
 And I didn't actually know where really we were going in the Philippines or what we were

81
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,680
 going to be doing there.

82
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,960
 So we got there late at night, the week of Easter, and it was too late to get any details.

83
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,800
 And we woke up first thing in the morning.

84
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,200
 And we had a big team meeting.

85
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,640
 There were 38 people from our church.

86
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:32,240
 And they talked about the ministry, where we were serving, and all the different projects

87
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,360
 that we could get involved with serving alongside the local community.

88
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
 So they described it.

89
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,320
 They said they had a home for pregnant teenagers and women who had been abused and who'd fallen

90
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,680
 pregnant.

91
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,220
 They had a children's home for babies and children who don't have families.

92
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,200
 They had a school and a feeding program for underprivileged children.

93
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,960
 And they had a maternal and child health clinic.

94
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,160
 My heart sunk.

95
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:11,320
 I had just taken a precious week of annual leave to go to the Philippines and volunteer

96
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:17,880
 at an organization that does almost the exact same thing that I do every day here in Hong

97
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
 Kong.

98
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,540
 I was like, "Oh, do I really have to do this, Lord?

99
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,740
 I love this work, but I need a break.

100
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,740
 I need a vacation.

101
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,700
 And here I am doing the exact same thing."

102
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:36,100
 Then they went on to describe the projects where we could be volunteering.

103
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,360
 And they said you could cement stucco.

104
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,780
 They were trying to build more rooms in the school.

105
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,280
 You could do cement stucco.

106
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,620
 You could lay sod in the garden outside the children's home.

107
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,560
 You could paint the nursery.

108
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,220
 They even had an opportunity to volunteer in the clinic, helping to deliver babies and

109
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,500
 look after the newborns who came in for their well baby checks.

110
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,580
 And I tell you, I'm so happy seeing your beautiful baby there in the back because, I mean, obviously

111
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,100
 with seven kids and working at Mother's Choice, I love babies.

112
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:15,420
 But the reality is I was there with my 12-year-old son who had no interest in going to the clinic.

113
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:23,980
 And so I found myself doing basically manual labor in the heat of the Philippine sun.

114
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,380
 And I didn't say anything out loud.

115
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,620
 Of course, I was there with the youth group and a parent volunteer.

116
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,980
 So I kept a smile on my face.

117
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,180
 But inside, I was pretty grumpy.

118
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,780
 I had a bad attitude.

119
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,180
 I was like, "Why am I doing this on my vacation?"

120
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,620
 And every evening, we would gather together with other teams from our church and they

121
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,100
 would talk about what they did.

122
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,180
 And the ladies who had come with their daughters had all been in the clinic and they were delivering

123
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,300
 three to four babies a day.

124
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,980
 And can you imagine, a teenager in Hong Kong doesn't get the chance to deliver a baby in

125
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
 the hospital.

126
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,620
 So they were all so impressed.

127
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,780
 They thought it was amazing.

128
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:10,420
 And they kept saying, "Aliya, you really need to meet the head midwife.

129
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,420
 She's incredible.

130
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,740
 She's like an army general.

131
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,700
 She tells everybody what to do and where to go.

132
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,580
 She creates like a gentle birthing environment for the women who've been through a lot of

133
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,580
 trauma.

134
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,580
 She's amazing.

135
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,660
 She's going to really be impressed meeting you because you've delivered seven kids."

136
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,260
 So I said, "Yeah, yeah, I'd love to meet her."

137
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,740
 And with the second to the last night, I am getting ready for dinner.

138
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,220
 And one of the other moms sees me and says, "I see her.

139
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,420
 She's down in the dining room.

140
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,300
 You got to come and meet her.

141
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,260
 Her name's Rona."

142
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:50,340
 So I come along and I see Rona and I say, "Hello."

143
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,100
 And the lady from my church says, "Rona, please meet Aliya.

144
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,460
 She's one of the volunteer moms from the Hong Kong mission trip.

145
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,540
 And actually, she runs a very similar organization in Hong Kong called Mother's Choice.

146
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,760
 You're going to love meeting her because she has..."

147
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,540
 And she doesn't even get the word seven kids out of her mouth because the woman suddenly

148
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,100
 bursts into tears.

149
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,060
 I mean, really crying.

150
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,700
 She's hyperventilating.

151
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
 She's mumbling.

152
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,780
 She's almost screaming.

153
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,180
 I couldn't really...

154
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,140
 I thought she was having a heart attack.

155
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,780
 So I'm like looking around to see if they have a defibrillator.

156
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,540
 Eventually she calms down enough and I hear the words that she's saying.

157
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,740
 She's like, "2005, 2005, was it you?

158
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,740
 Was it you?

159
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,260
 I've been trying to recard all these years.

160
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
 Was it you?"

161
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,660
 And finally I said, "What?

162
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,300
 I don't think I've ever met you before.

163
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,860
 Are you trying to say that you visited Mother's Choice in 2005?

164
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,860
 Definitely wasn't me.

165
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,940
 Maybe Gretchen, maybe Kit Ying, maybe somebody else from our team.

166
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,080
 Why?"

167
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,940
 And she proceeded to tell me the story.

168
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,100
 She said, "I was a domestic worker in Hong Kong."

169
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,740
 And she didn't tell me what happened, but it was pretty clear from how she said it.

170
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,100
 She said, "I experienced extreme trauma.

171
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,220
 And as a result, I was pregnant."

172
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,740
 She said, "I didn't know what to do.

173
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,380
 I was so upset.

174
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,860
 And she's a medical professional.

175
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,860
 She's a nurse.

176
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,860
 She's a nurse and midwife."

177
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:32,900
 So she said, "She tried to terminate the pregnancy herself five times and it didn't work."

178
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,760
 She said she was so depressed she would go on the street and see cigarettes and put them

179
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,020
 out on her arms.

180
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,540
 She eventually went to the top of her building where she decided that she was going to jump

181
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,540
 off.

182
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,560
 But she said she felt someone, something stop her.

183
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,460
 Eventually it came time for her to deliver her baby and she went to the hospital and

184
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,940
 she said, "I still remember the name of the doctor.

185
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,940
 Dr. Ma.

186
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,860
 Hope one day I get to meet him."

187
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:06,580
 And he gave her a scan and he said, "Miss, you're going to have this baby.

188
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,580
 But I need to tell you that this baby has some very serious medical conditions."

189
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,360
 I don't know if it was a result of what had happened, but he said, "This baby needs serious

190
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,360
 medical intervention."

191
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,340
 And she said she just started weeping because she thought, "I can't stay here in Hong Kong

192
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,700
 where this thing has happened to me, but how can I go back to my home country with this

193
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,820
 baby who's going to need medical care?

194
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,260
 I don't have the support for that."

195
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:40,340
 And the doctor looked at her and he said, "I know a place here in Hong Kong that takes

196
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:46,060
 really good care of babies and they find families for those babies.

197
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,500
 I'll take you there."

198
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,860
 Now she said, "That was 2005.

199
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,980
 I brought the baby to Mother's Choice and you guys took the baby, but you know you can't

200
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,980
 sign off on adoption right away in Hong Kong.

201
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,180
 It takes quite a long time period."

202
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,580
 So she went back and about two weeks had gone by and she said she just cried every day and

203
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,260
 every night and she couldn't leave the little boy, who she called Joseph, behind.

204
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,020
 So she came back to Mother's Choice after two weeks and said she wanted her baby back.

205
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,020
 And of course, they gave the baby back to her.

206
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,900
 And she said, "I went back to the Philippines."

207
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:28,380
 She said, "But that was the same year that the ministry where I was volunteering was

208
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,460
 started."

209
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:35,180
 And she said, "Because of what you did for me in my moment of extreme need," she said,

210
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:41,900
 "I decided to become their head midwife and now I have delivered 4,000 babies from pregnant

211
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,420
 teenagers and women who've been through trauma like me."

212
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,100
 And I started to cry because I thought, "God, I had such a bad attitude.

213
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,100
 I didn't want to come here to serve.

214
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:01,420
 I felt like what we were doing, this manual labor, is worthless and I feel discouraged

215
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,940
 back in my work at home in Hong Kong."

216
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,480
 I thought I was going to the Philippines for my son, but I think God had me choose to go

217
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,100
 on that service trip with my church for me.

218
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,780
 It was a divine appointment because I'll tell you, Mother's Choice looked after that baby

219
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,780
 for two weeks.

220
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,740
 It wouldn't have even been in our impact report.

221
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,460
 We wouldn't have even counted it in our numbers.

222
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,100
 We would have felt like we didn't really do anything.

223
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:35,380
 But because whoever were the volunteers at that time said yes to serving, to volunteering,

224
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:42,180
 and that doctor, that woman has gone to another country and saved 4,000 children.

225
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:50,860
 And I thought, "God, you're reminding me that we are called, we are called to serve others."

226
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,900
 And when we serve others like Dr. Ma and those volunteers at Mother's Choice 18 years ago,

227
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,820
 God multiplies our impact.

228
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,620
 And when we choose to serve others like I very reluctantly chose to do with Paxton,

229
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:14,460
 we can receive too because I received an encouragement that God knew that I needed.

230
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:21,880
 So we know that serving is really important, but why do we serve our community?

231
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:28,980
 So next I just want to unpack the importance of relationship and community.

232
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:35,220
 Now the Bible says, and this is one of my favorite verses, "Two really are better than

233
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,900
 one."

234
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,620
 We are built to be in relationship.

235
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:45,140
 Nobody, not one of you, not me, and not any single one of you in this room, you cannot

236
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,900
 go through life alone.

237
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,380
 We need each other.

238
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:58,620
 And when we serve, as I said, we're called to serve, we need to serve relationally.

239
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:06,020
 We need to become community for the lonely now more than ever in Hong Kong.

240
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:11,860
 Because I actually believe that this is a pivotal moment in Hong Kong history.

241
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,860
 We're at an inflection point and it's not just in Hong Kong, I believe it's around the

242
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,860
 world.

243
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,260
 I believe that people will look back on this time and say everything changed.

244
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:28,060
 And over the last few years, what we've seen happening in Hong Kong, and even since the

245
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:35,300
 last time I came here to preach, we've seen a huge rise in social isolation.

246
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,620
 That was exacerbated by the social unrest and by COVID restrictions.

247
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,660
 But even now that we're all online, we have church online, we have online school, we can

248
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:53,620
 do everything online, we've actually become much less connected as a community.

249
00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:00,940
 And without community support, without people having deeper relationships with friends,

250
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:08,300
 with family, even with their faith community, we have seen more marriages break down.

251
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,180
 We have seen more mental health problems.

252
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,940
 I'm really blown away that you guys were doing Restore, it's so needed right now.

253
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:21,360
 We are seeing, as people are experiencing more financial stress, we've also seen a huge

254
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,580
 increase in Hong Kong in substance abuse.

255
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:31,180
 Now all of this isolation and people going through all these problems without having

256
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:37,180
 people who can speak into their lives to support them, all of that has made families a lot

257
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,020
 more vulnerable.

258
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:44,160
 And that has led to this child protection crisis that I was telling you, we have never

259
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,540
 seen anything like it in Hong Kong's history before.

260
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:53,440
 We have more child abuse, more child neglect, more child abandonment.

261
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,520
 And the reality is there's actually tens of thousands of families right now that are very

262
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,360
 socially isolated where their children are at very high risk, and 4,000 children living

263
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,800
 in full-time residential care.

264
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,300
 I mean, we're really at a breaking point.

265
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,160
 And I think you just need to pick up the newspaper any day of the week here in Hong Kong to recognize

266
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,780
 what's happening.

267
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,120
 Now the challenge for me, and this is what we see at Mother's Choice, of the children

268
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,720
 who enter into residential care in Hong Kong, most of them never leave.

269
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,280
 They spend most of their childhoods without a family.

270
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,280
 And I love, is it Elizabeth, the missionary from Cambodia?

271
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,440
 Babies without somebody to look after them die.

272
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,760
 You children need family.

273
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,440
 And so the longer children stay without that permanent legal family who love them, who

274
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,880
 look after them, even if they have food, even if they have a roof over their head, even

275
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,000
 if they have school, they're more likely to have physical and mental health problems.

276
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 They're more likely to do drugs.

277
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,280
 They're more likely to drop out of school.

278
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,060
 They're more likely to go to prison.

279
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,040
 And of course, if they're a girl, they're the most likely to get pregnant between the

280
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,320
 ages of 12 and 25.

281
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,280
 And then of course, if you're a pregnant teenager without a family, your child is very likely

282
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,760
 to end up in the residential care system.

283
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,120
 And the cycle begins again.

284
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,720
 So it's a vicious cycle.

285
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,760
 But I'm standing here today with great hope.

286
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,000
 I'm not depressed, even though I was crying in the last song.

287
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,520
 Because I want to tell you that there's actually something that is so much more powerful than

288
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,080
 this vicious cycle.

289
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,400
 There's something that breaks it.

290
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,680
 And that is family.

291
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:47,640
 But the reality is no family, not my family, not your family, no family can do it on their

292
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,160
 own.

293
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:54,200
 Families need to be supported by their community.

294
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,480
 Families in this church need to be supported by their community.

295
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,600
 And that's why since I was last here, even with all the uncertainty and challenge of

296
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,680
 COVID, we actually started safe families.

297
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:15,120
 And that's because we were seeing so many young single mothers who wanted to parent

298
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,600
 their children.

299
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,440
 And actually, there are programs and there are things to support those women in Hong

300
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
 Kong.

301
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,120
 But they were struggling to even access or go to those programs or to receive those supports.

302
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,280
 And that's because they didn't have relationship.

303
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,800
 They didn't have anybody who could watch their child when they needed a break or need to

304
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
 go shopping.

305
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,720
 They didn't have anybody to talk through their problems or nobody to be their mentor or to

306
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
 be their role model.

307
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,360
 They didn't have any community.

308
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,440
 So that's why we started safe families.

309
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,400
 And it's not something, it's not the same as becoming a foster parent or becoming an

310
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,760
 adoptive parent.

311
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,320
 Safe families is saying, I want to be community to a young single mom and her child and want

312
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,880
 to become an extended family.

313
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,000
 And actually, I was so blown away to see one of our safe, amazing stars, single mom, safe

314
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,720
 family volunteers here in the front row.

315
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,120
 But I just want to tell you, what does it really mean to be community?

316
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,720
 I want to share two stories with you, two real stories that happened since I was last

317
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,400
 here and we started safe families.

318
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,360
 There was one girl, I was really moved by her story because she called her safe family

319
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,320
 volunteer crying, saying that she wanted to place her child into the orphanage and foster

320
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,760
 care system in Hong Kong.

321
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,960
 And her safe families volunteer was really upset.

322
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,520
 She drove over and went to her apartment and said, "Why do you want to place your child

323
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
 in the system?

324
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,840
 I thought you really wanted to take care of your baby.

325
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
 What's wrong?"

326
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,280
 And she said, she was weeping, "I'm a terrible mother.

327
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,760
 I can't take care of this baby.

328
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,480
 I'm a terrible mother."

329
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,360
 And she said, "Why do you, you're an amazing mom.

330
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,520
 Why do you think you're a terrible mother?"

331
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,320
 She said, "Look at my baby."

332
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,680
 And the baby had scratches on his face.

333
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:10,160
 And she said, "Oh," she said, "the baby keeps scratching his face and now the baby's face

334
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,740
 is bleeding."

335
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:17,920
 And her safe family friend, you know, who's an experienced mom said, "Oh, sweetheart,

336
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
 that's normal.

337
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,480
 You know, babies can't control their hands for the first few months.

338
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,720
 Their nails grow real sharp.

339
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,960
 You have to cut their nails.

340
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,920
 But you know, that's normal.

341
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,760
 You just put, you can put the mittens on the baby's hands.

342
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
 It's not a big deal."

343
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,160
 And she was crying, "I don't have any mittens."

344
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,120
 And she said, "Do you have socks for the baby?"

345
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,440
 She said, "Yes, we'll put the socks on the baby's hands.

346
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
 It's okay."

347
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,480
 You know, but I'm just telling you that, you know, even though she had housing, even though

348
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,000
 she didn't have the strength to mother without community.

349
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,120
 And sometimes being community, it doesn't matter if you're single, if you're young or

350
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,040
 if you're older, if you're married or you're, it doesn't matter.

351
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,720
 You all have something to offer.

352
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,080
 Another young girl's story who really impacted me and showed me the power of community is

353
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,040
 it was somebody from our wider church network here who agreed to be a friend.

354
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,420
 She said, "Look, I don't want to take care of your baby.

355
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,760
 But what I will do is I want to be the one, I'm going to drive you."

356
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,320
 Her baby was born a little bit sick and had to go to the MCHC, to the clinic, you know,

357
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
 every couple of weeks.

358
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,580
 She said, "I will bring you.

359
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,140
 I have a driver.

360
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,760
 I'll go with, in my car, I'll bring my car, I'll pick you up.

361
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,320
 I'm going to take you to the clinic because even if you have an appointment, you know,

362
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,960
 you got to wait there like two, three hours, right?"

363
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,800
 And so she came to visit us after the baby hit, I think, two months old.

364
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,560
 She came back to Mother's Choice to visit us.

365
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,820
 And our housemother said, "How are you doing?"

366
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,020
 And she was crying again.

367
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,380
 She said, "Why are you crying?"

368
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,100
 And she said, "I'm just so touched."

369
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,160
 She said, "Even my mother, my boyfriend, not one of them has ever taken me to the hospital

370
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,460
 or came to visit me in the hospital."

371
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,740
 And this lady from the church who didn't feel like she could do anything, but she had a

372
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,940
 driver and could take her to her appointments, you know, she felt so loved.

373
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,540
 She experienced the power of community.

374
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,100
 And so I want to tell you this about community.

375
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,180
 Community isn't about being a superhero, okay?

376
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,620
 You don't have to be a professional social worker or something like that.

377
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,580
 You just need to be someone's friend.

378
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,200
 You just need to be in relationship.

379
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,600
 That's what it means to be community.

380
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,820
 The God that we serve is a really good Father.

381
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,860
 And He's actually the author and designer of family.

382
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,580
 And family is really important to Him.

383
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:50,900
 In fact, the Bible tells us that He is the Father to the fatherless.

384
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,460
 He's the defender of widows.

385
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,420
 And He is the one who sets the lonely in families.

386
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:04,940
 And I believe that part of our mission and our calling to serving the community as a

387
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:11,020
 church is not only to be community for families that are vulnerable and struggling, but we

388
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:17,220
 are actually called to be family for those who don't have a family at all.

389
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,620
 And the truth is, family is not just blood, right?

390
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,100
 It's not just the people who we have a DNA connection with.

391
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,340
 And I really believe that it's important for us in the church in Hong Kong to redefine

392
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,620
 what family means.

393
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:38,180
 I love this quote from Mother Teresa, because she said that the problem with the world is

394
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,260
 that we draw the circle of our family.

395
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,300
 That means we define who our family is far too small.

396
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:50,300
 Because I think the reality is that family isn't DNA.

397
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,500
 Family is love and commitment, right?

398
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,140
 Because so what I tell my kids when I'm trying to tell them what does it mean to be in our

399
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,380
 family, I say, "Family sticks together."

400
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,380
 Okay?

401
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,340
 Family forgives each other.

402
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:13,100
 Family we see the best in each other, and we walk through the worst with each other.

403
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,900
 Family tells you that you're never going to be alone.

404
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:27,940
 There are so many who are alone right here in Hong Kong.

405
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,580
 I want to tell you the story of a little boy.

406
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,980
 It was actually a man on a bicycle who found him.

407
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:41,820
 He was a newborn baby, and he was left by the footbridge off the highway in Tai Po.

408
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,780
 The man on the bicycle saw the package moving, realized it was a baby, and he called the

409
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,600
 police.

410
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,860
 The police actually got there pretty quickly, and it was immediately obvious to them that

411
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,980
 the baby had very serious medical needs.

412
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,580
 And so they called an ambulance, and he was sent to the hospital.

413
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:08,140
 His condition was so severe that he actually spent 17 months in two different hospitals

414
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,860
 here in Hong Kong.

415
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:16,540
 And it was after 17 months that we got the call, and that was almost exactly 10 years

416
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,420
 ago, 2013.

417
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:26,380
 I was just one year into my new role as CEO of Mother's Choice.

418
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,060
 I tell you, I got that phone call, and I was terrified.

419
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,060
 I was really scared.

420
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,780
 And actually, all of us were.

421
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,180
 Could we care for a baby with this severe medical needs?

422
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,500
 Would we ever be able to find him a family?

423
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,700
 Because we don't want to keep kids with us permanently.

424
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,340
 We're trying to aim to get them to be adopted or to go back to their birth families.

425
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,660
 And the truth is, with his medical diagnosis, we even wondered, would he even live long

426
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,220
 enough to be able to find a family?

427
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,700
 But even though we were scared, we said yes.

428
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,500
 And I'm so glad that we did.

429
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,900
 In 2015, we actually found an adoptive family for Nolan.

430
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,540
 That's what they called him in the United States.

431
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,100
 And they totally fell in love with him.

432
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,900
 And they were so blown away by his capacity for love.

433
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:25,300
 And I think that's really something that he learned from our local volunteers here in

434
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,700
 our child care home, who loved him and cared for him so tenderly.

435
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:38,140
 And so they actually determined that they wanted to adopt another little boy who had

436
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,580
 been Nolan's best friend in our child care home.

437
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:48,840
 Now Francis was blind and had some other medical needs and was eight years old by the time

438
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,900
 Nolan legally became his brother.

439
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:57,800
 But he got to experience what it meant to be loved and to join a family.

440
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:04,600
 And then just last year, at the height of our COVID restrictions and all the challenges

441
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:11,820
 we were having here in Hong Kong, that same family was inspired to adopt their third child

442
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,060
 from Mother's Choice.

443
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,740
 Now little Oakland was quadriplegic, just like Nolan.

444
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:26,460
 And honestly, if we had not had the courage to say yes to Nolan and then see him find

445
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,600
 a family, we wouldn't have had courage to say yes to her either.

446
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,220
 And so I want to show you their story because God designed for them to be in family.

447
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:52,220
 So let's go.

461
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:59,220
 When we began our journey with Nolan, it was heavy on my heart that his story is more than

462
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
 just coming into our family.

463
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,220
 We would always say, if nothing else, his story will encourage others to take that first

464
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,220
 step towards adoption.

465
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,220
 And it did.

466
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,220
 Our story is not about us.

467
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:18,220
 It really is about Nolan and that connection between him, Francis, and Oakland.

468
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:24,220
 Nolan also created a passion and avenue for me to help and encourage others to just go

469
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:30,220
 for it and for me to advocate for these kids in need.

470
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,220
 There are days when choosing joy is very hard.

471
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:38,220
 Even on the hard days, though, I am the lucky one.

472
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:45,220
 Adoption is creating a family from broken places that all of us have and then putting it

473
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:52,220
 back together to make a picture more beautiful than we could have ever created on our own.

474
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,220
 It's not about us or anything that we do special.

475
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:03,220
 It's simply that their stories do not have to end in an institution.

476
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:14,220
 Our vision at Mother's Choice is every child, every child in the city of Hong Kong in a

477
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,220
 loving family.

478
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:22,220
 And we know that that's the heart of our father God for this city, too.

479
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:30,220
 And we believe that it's possible for our vision to become a reality in Hong Kong, in

480
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:37,220
 our nation of China, in our world, that every child can grow up knowing that they're safe,

481
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,220
 that they're loved, that they have a mother and a father.

482
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,220
 I'll tell you something.

483
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:49,220
 I believe that it's possible for Hong Kong to be the best place in the world to raise

484
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,220
 children.

485
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,220
 I believe that people will no longer leave this city because they want to give their

486
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,220
 children a better life, but people will move to Hong Kong because this is the best place

487
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:04,220
 for their children to be raised.

488
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:13,220
 I know that this is a radical vision and sounds crazy when you read the newspapers, but I

489
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,220
 believe that it's possible.

490
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,220
 I want to tell you something.

491
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,220
 It's going to take you.

492
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,220
 It's going to take us.

493
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,220
 It's going to take us, this is the church here in Hong Kong.

494
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,220
 It's going to take us to saying yes.

495
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:34,220
 We're going to start saying yes to serving, saying yes to being community for those who

496
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:40,220
 are lonely and isolated, and it's going to take us saying yes to being family.

497
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:49,220
 The children like Nolan and Francis and Oakland could be adopted right here in Hong Kong.

498
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:56,220
 Serving the community looks like family, and I want to tell you this as you go out to dinner

499
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:01,220
 tonight, as you go home, as you meet up with your friends, I want you to think about how

500
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:06,220
 you can serve, whether you sign up to give your time and your expertise to serve others,

501
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:12,220
 to go on the next mission trip to Cambodia, whether you volunteer at Mother's Choice

502
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:19,220
 Safe Families, become a foster parent, or you just show kindness to the lonely and the

503
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,220
 hurting who are right here in this room tonight.

504
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,220
 You know, you greet the person who you don't know.

505
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,220
 You offer to take somebody out for coffee or for lunch.

506
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
 You visit somebody in the hospital.

507
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,220
 You invite, you see a single mom and you see if you can bring her kid to Sunday school

508
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,220
 or help her out.

509
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:44,220
 Whether you decide to open your own home and heart as an adoptive family, and I believe

510
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:49,220
 that there are people right here in this congregation who maybe not now, but maybe later, you could

511
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,220
 open your heart to adoption later.

512
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:59,220
 I believe that when we decide at Gong Fook Church, the wider church here in Hong Kong,

513
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:05,220
 when we decide that we want to serve our community as family, that we are going to see our city,

514
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,220
 Hong Kong, transformed.

515
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,220
 So, thank you so much.

516
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
 Thanks so much for listening to me today.

517
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,220
 God bless you.

518
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,220
