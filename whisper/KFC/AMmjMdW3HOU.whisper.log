[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.400]  早安
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.400]  大家好
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.320]  今天我們會說耶穌進入耶路撒冷
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.680]  Triumph of entry into Jerusalem
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.200]  你有看過奧斯卡嗎?
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.960]  有沒有人喜歡看奧斯卡?
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.000]  奧斯卡,沒人看
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.640]  只有Vincent和Santa
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.320]  奧斯卡是怎樣的?
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.160]  它有紅色的帆布
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.320]  紅色帆布是用來做甚麼?
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.800]  明星是怎樣的?
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.800]  是拍照的
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.320]  穿甚麼?
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.840]  穿睡衣?
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.160]  穿最漂亮的衣服
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.040]  最新的時裝
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.880]  有些是很帥氣的
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.680]  有些可能是很醜的
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.040]  但穿起來是給人看的
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.280]  表演,他們多厲害
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.280]  他們多有贊助
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.960]  之前羅馬歷史也有Triumph of entry
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.480]  我們看下一個
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.960]  羅馬的Triumph of entry
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.920]  有沒有看過Gladiator?
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.440]  有看過Gladiator嗎?
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.680]  只有老人家看Gladiator
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.000]  CY和Lok看到
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]  OK
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.320]  Gladiator是怎樣的?
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560]  有一個Triumph of entry
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.840]  into Rome
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.640]  他們為甚麼有一個Triumph of entry into Rome?
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640]  因為他們打贏了哪個人?
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.160]  那些German
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.480]  他們在德國擴展了更多的地區
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.440]  平時有一個Triumph of entry
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.200]  因為這個General
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.000]  打了5000個敵人
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.560]  5000個敵人的士兵
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.120]  然後他會怎樣?
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.200]  他會有Trophies of War
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.400]  可能收到很多金
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.160]  很多不同的Treasures
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160]  他就會表演出來
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.640]  之後Prisoners of War
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.960]  可能捕捉了一個皇帝
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.000]  一個Prince
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.960]  一個Queen
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.040]  他會一起這樣
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.360]  Parade出來
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.320]  他會有Intense Praise
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.000]  and Worship
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.040]  他會哭
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.800]  Caesar
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.040]  他贏了一個Battle
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.040]  Caesar
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.760]  今天我們看耶穌的Triumph of entry
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.080]  Jesus' Triumph of entry
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.880]  What it was like
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.240]  我們一起讀
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.000]  Mark 11
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.480]  Let's read together Mark 11
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.480]  我們一起讀
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.480]  Ready? 1, 2, 3
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.880]  As they approached Jerusalem
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.880]  and came to Bethesda
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.520]  and Bethany in the Mount of Olives
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.920]  Jesus sent two of his disciples
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.280]  saying to them
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.840]  Go to the village ahead of you
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.760]  just as you enter it
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.160]  and you will find a colt there
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.400]  which no one has ever ridden
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.640]  Untie it and bring it here
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.400]  If anyone asks you
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.840]  why are you doing this
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.920]  say the Lord needs it
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.560]  and will send it back here shortly
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.840]  繼續讀
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.120]  1, 2, 3
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.040]  They went and found a colt
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.800]  outside in the street
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.480]  tied at the doorway
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.840]  As they untied it
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.000]  some people standing there asked
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.200]  What are you doing
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.880]  untying that colt
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.920]  They answered
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.000]  as Jesus had told them to
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.080]  and the people let them go
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.240]  When they brought the colt to Jesus
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.240]  and threw their cloaks over it
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.680]  he sat on it
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.760]  Many people spread their cloaks
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.720]  on the road
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.880]  while others spread branches
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.600]  they cut in the fields
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.080]  耶穌知道
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.800]  他是最後一次
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.240]  enter Jerusalem
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.440]  最後一次
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.920]  他就準備他自己
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.600]  他怎麼準備
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.520]  他就叫門徒拿些什麼
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.480]  這些小孩
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.920]  Owen
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.880]  耶穌叫門徒準備些什麼
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.880]  是不是蛋糕
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.680]  是不是蛋糕
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.640]  生日蛋糕
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.080]  是一隻小狗
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.800]  OK
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.520]  It's a donkey
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.640]  I'm not joking
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.520]  OK
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.760]  我們
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.840]  So why a donkey
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.120]  Why a donkey
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.000]  在舊約
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.080]  是預言
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.000]  那個 Messiah 會來
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]  我們看幾節
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.680]  在 Daniel 第七章
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.040]  我們一起看
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.560]  Daniel 第七章
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.480]  下一頁
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.760]  下一頁
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.360]  下一頁
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.720]  對,這一頁
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.680]  在我的視覺中
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.800]  我看到一個像男人的兒子
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.040]  He was coming with the clouds of heaven
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.520]  所以以色列就以為
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.480]  什麼 Messiah 會來
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.800]  What kind of Messiah would come
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.880]  One that would come with the clouds
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.840]  Mighty
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.600]  Strong
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.480]  平時
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.200]  那些皇帝是用什麼去入
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.840]  entry
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.000]  What would they ride
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.240]  What would they ride
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.680]  They would ride a horse
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.880]  The horse symbolize 什麼
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.320]  Victory
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.040]  Would symbolize war
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.000]  Power
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.640]  是嗎
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.280]  但耶穌是用什麼入去 Jerusalem
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.880]  一個 Colt
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.320]  A donkey
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.080]  我們看下一個 前一部
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.520]  我們一起讀
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.560]  1,2,3
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.760]  Behold, your king is coming to you
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.320]  He is just and having salvation
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.720]  Lowly and riding on a donkey
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.760]  A colt
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.480]  The fall of a donkey
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.000]  都有 Prophecy
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.520]  是說耶穌會 enter Jerusalem
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.760]  On a donkey
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.680]  On a donkey
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.960]  And so
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.080]  The Israelites as we see in the next slide
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.240]  They were expecting a mighty prophesied mighty king
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.400]  但有什麼來了
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.920]  一個 very lowly king
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.440]  他是騎什麼
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.880]  騎一個 donkey
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.280]  以色列覺得有一個很厲害的皇帝會來
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.680]  King of war
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.600]  但有什麼來
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.840]  It's a king of peace
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.520]  A colt symbolizes peace
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.800]  為什麼以色列想有一個 mighty messiah
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.800]  為什麼
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.360]  為什麼以色列想要一個 mighty
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.800]  mighty king
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.800]  你知不知道 有沒有人知道
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.600]  Why do they want a mighty king
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.480]  Why do they want a mighty king
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.280]  因為
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.200]  As we see in the next slide
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.240]  There is a history of oppression in Israel
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.320]  OK
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.720]  What was the first country
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.160]  To enslave Israel
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.760]  Egypt 埃及
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.320]  是不是
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.840]  知不知道多少年
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.480]  How many years
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.240]  400 years
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.400]  你們幾多歲
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.560]  十幾歲
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.200]  Times how much
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.000]  Times how much is 400 years
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.400]  Imagine
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.160]  Imagine
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.320]  Your life times 20 times
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.200]  是什麼
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.520]  每天這麼熱
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.880]  要做pyramid
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.680]  喜不喜歡做
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.200]  有沒有人喜歡做pyramid
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.880]  天天做pyramid
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.520]  有沒有人喜歡
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.600]  有沒有人試過
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.640]  沒有
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.560]  OK
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.600]  OK imagine 你們自己
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.200]  每天400 years
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.640]  要被人做hard labor
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.840]  你的心理會怎麼樣
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.400]  Gabe would go crazy
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.120]  Maybe he is a bit crazy already
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.160]  你們覺得你的心理會怎麼樣
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.600]  Lucas how would you feel
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.520]  If you had to do hard labor
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.000]  For 400 years
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.840]  你的心理會怎麼樣
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.960]  是不是很強

[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.760]  你覺得you are worthless
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.760]  You are so lowly
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.760]  是不是
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.760]  然後
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.760]  神free了他
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.760]  Through Moses through the opening of the Red Sea
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.760]  They escaped
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.760]  然後去回Israel
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.760]  但是他們做什麼
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.760]  他們犯罪
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.760]  他們犯罪 神就怎麼樣

[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.760]  舉手有沒有punish過你
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.760]  Uncle Paul
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.760]  他都記得
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.760]  他犯罪
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.760]  神就怎麼樣
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.760]  Punish他們
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.760]  他send什麼人過來
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.760]  What people
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.760]  Was it
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.760]  Was it the Americans
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.760]  是不是
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.760]  是不是美國人去punish以色列
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.760]  誰覺得是美國人

[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.760]  太
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.760]  That's a lot later
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.760]  The Assyrians
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.760]  Now a day it's Iraq or Iran
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.760]  The Assyrians came
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.760]  and destroyed them
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.760]  And then what did they do
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.760]  They enslave them
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.760]  and intermarried with them
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.760]  然後是The Babylonians
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.760]  你知道他們的方法去punish是怎麼樣
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.760]  他們的方法punish
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.760]  記不記得Daniel
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.760]  What happened with Daniel
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.760]  Lion King
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.760]  Lion Den
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.760]  不是Lion King
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.760]  Babylonians過來就怎麼樣
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.760]  如果Babylonians過來
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.760]  他們會怎麼樣
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.760]  他們會怎樣enslave我們
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.760]  They will take the best of us
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.760]  Who is the best of us
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.760]  They will take the best of us
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.760]  Who is the best
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.760]  OK
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.760]  就會拿走Owen和這個小孩
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.760]  打機的小孩就會拿走
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.760]  The best gamers
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.760]  They will take away the best gamers
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.760]  Away
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.760]  他們之前
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.760]  為什麼拿Daniel
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.760]  He was unblemished
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.760]  Perfect, talented
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.760]  帥哥
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.760]  是嗎
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.760]  帥哥
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.760]  OK,又是他們,Gamers
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.760]  OK
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.760]  所以以色列的人
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.760]  是很oppress
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.760]  他們這麼多年
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.760]  都是multiple enemies
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.760]  attacking them
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.760]  所以他們很害怕
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.760]  Think they are lowly
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.760]  但是神就
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.760]  為什麼跟他們說他們是什麼人
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.760]  他們是什麼人
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.760]  They are
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.760]  God's chosen people
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.760]  所以很conflicting
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.760]  是不是
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.760]  為什麼這麼多國家
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.760]  come and humiliate us
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.760]  enslave us
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.760]  但是神為什麼跟我們說
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.760]  我們是God's chosen people
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.760]  Do you see the conflict
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.760]  明白嗎
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.760]  再說一次,不明白就
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.760]  Do you understand
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.760]  Nod your head, yes
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.760]  OK
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.760]  所以耶穌來的時候
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.760]  他們就很有希望
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.760]  他們的希望是什麼
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.760]  They would be free
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.760]  They would be free
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.760]  They would restore Israel
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.760]  to the prominence
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.760]  Israel
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.760]  最prominent是什麼
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.760]  什麼king
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.760]  是不是Lion King
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.760]  是King David
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.760]  King Solomon
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.760]  The prominence of Israel
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.760]  Restore Israel
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.760]  但是耶穌來的時候
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.760]  是What happened
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.760]  為什麼這個皇帝
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.760]  不是Horse
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.760]  是什麼
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.760]  Donkey
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.760]  為什麼他來不是
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.760]  Defeat Romans
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.760]  他帶什麼
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.760]  平安
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.760]  They were so confused
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.760]  They were so confused
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.760]  They were so confused
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.760]  They were expecting a mighty king
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.760]  As you see in the next slide
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.760]  Next slide
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.760]  They were expecting a mighty king
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.760]  A king of war
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.760]  A conquering king
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.760]  To defeat the Romans
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.760]  但是耶穌不是這樣的皇帝
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.760]  他是什麼皇帝
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.760]  他是一個Lowly king
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.760]  On a donkey
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.760]  這個Donkey symbolize peace
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.760]  還有他來
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.760]  不是Conquer
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.760]  Conquer
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.760]  他來是侍奉
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.760]  He came to seek
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.760]  and serve those who were lost
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.760]  How did
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.760]  How did Jesus serve
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.760]  He touched
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.760]  the lepers
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.760]  He healed the blind people
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.760]  He ate with prostitutes
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.760]  and sinners and tax collectors
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.760]  Jesus was a servant
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.760]  King
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.760]  He washed the disciples feet
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.760]  He washed the disciples feet
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.760]  我們繼續讀
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.760]  Mark chapter 11
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.760]  Let's read the next verse
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.760]  第九節
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.760]  OK
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.760]  Let's read together
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.760]  1,2,3
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.760]  Those who went ahead
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.760]  and those who followed
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.760]  shouted Hosanna
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.760]  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.760]  Blessed is the coming king
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.760]  of our father David
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.760]  Hosanna in the highest heaven
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.760]  Jesus entered Jerusalem
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.760]  and went to the temple courts
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.760]  He looked around
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.760]  at everything
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.760]  but since it was already late
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.760]  He walked out in Bethany
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.760]  with the twelve
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.760]  耶穌進來的時候
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.760]  那些人怎樣
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.760]  那些人的反應是怎樣
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.760]  那些人的反應是怎樣
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.760]  What was their response?
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.760]  Happy or sad?
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.760]  Happy
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.760]  Happy

[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.760]  是不是
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.760]  如果有皇帝來
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.760]  你會不會擺你的衣服
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.760]  你擺什麼衣服

[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.760]  是不是
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.760]  之前的衣服貴不貴
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.760]  值不值錢
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.760]  是否很貴
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.760]  是否很貴

[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.760]  不便宜的
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.760]  是不是
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.760]  他們擺他們的衣服
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.760]  是一種尊敬
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.760]  是一種尊敬
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.760]  是一種尊敬
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.760]  他們希望
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.760]  這是皇帝的禮物
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.760]  他們有Palm olive tree

[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.760]  What does Hosanna mean
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.760]  Hosanna means save us
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.760]  Please

[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.760]  Yasha
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.760]  Yasha
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.760]  Which means to save
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.760]  or deliver
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.760]  Ana, which means please

[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.760]  什麼時候才會說
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.760]  什麼時候才會說
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.760]  你叫救命才會說
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.760]  是不是

[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.760]  OK
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.760]  記不記得我以前

[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.760]  And then what happened
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.760]  The weather changed
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.760]  Everything is T1
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.760]  The wave started going bigger
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.760]  然後What happened
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.760]  我們不是

[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.760]  入了水
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.760]  然後我們就翻了
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.760]  那我就求神
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.760]  OK
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.760]  不是
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.760]  很多小朋友翻我的船
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.760]  不是T1
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.760]  OK
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.760]  翻了然後怎樣

[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.760]  OK
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.760]  And I was crying out to god
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.760]  God save us
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.760]  I actually
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.760]  You know the story
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.760]  Jesus calming the storm
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.760]  I actually prayed
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.760]  你知道那kayak有多重
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.760]  入了水的時候
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.760]  你知道嗎
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.760]  是不是一噸
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.760]  你知道多重嗎
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.760]  水重不重
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.760]  It's very heavy
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.760]  OK
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.760]  So I was like god save us
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.760]  I really asked Jesus calm the storm
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.760]  OK
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.760]  Did Jesus calm the storm
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.760]  He did not
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.760]  He did not
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.760]  OK
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.760]  他們說你們在那裡
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.760]  我們在釣魚
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.760]  我們在看位置去釣魚
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.760]  然後我說你可不可以幫我們
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.760]  flip翻船
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.760]  弄些鎚出來
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.760]  然後托我們回岸邊
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.760]  可以入去
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.760]  Hopefully we get to safety
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.760]  Lord save us
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.760]  叫救命才是
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.760]  Come save us
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.760]  以色列人
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.760]  400年來
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.760]  以色列人來
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.760]  巴布林人把他們帶走
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.760]  從他們的保證之地
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.760]  現在羅馬人
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.760]  把他們放在他們的控制之下
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.760]  救救我們
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.760]  拜託
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.760]  他們是很勇敢的人
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.760]  以色列人
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.760]  叫救命
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.760]  叫救命
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.760]  他們在求誰
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.760]  他們在求
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.760]  他們在求
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.760]  物質的救
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.760]  從羅馬人
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.760]  但耶穌
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.760]  沒有來求物質的救
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.760]  為什麼
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.760]  祂來
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.760]  祂來求
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.760]  靈性的救
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.760]  以色列只是看到
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.760]  他們自己的需要
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.760]  但主耶穌過來
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.760]  就是看什麼需要
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.760]  整個世界的需要
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.760]  這個世界需要什麼
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.760]  需要救
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.760]  真正的靈性的救
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.760]  真正的靈性的救
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.760]  真正的靈性的救
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.760]  所以以色列人
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.760]  在求一個偉大的王
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.760]  在求一個偉大的王
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.760]  但他們得到了一個寂寞的王
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.760]  他們在求
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.760]  一位戰爭的王
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.760]  一位戰勝的王
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.760]  一位和平的王
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.760]  一位和平的王
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.760]  他們在求
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.760]  物質的自由
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.760]  物質的救
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.760]  但耶穌來
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.760]  是給真正的
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.760]  平安
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.760]  真正的救恩
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.760]  真正的救恩
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.760]  靈性的救
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.760]  耶穌
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.760]  是寂寞的王
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.760]  是寂寞的王
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.760]  和平的王
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.760]  侍奉的王
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.760]  而他也是
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.760]  救恩的王
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.760]  靈性的救恩的王
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.760]  靈性的救恩的王
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.760]  我們
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.760]  上個星期
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.760]  差不多上個星期
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.760]  去了哪裡
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.760]  去了柬埔寨
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.760]  我們看下一個圖
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.760]  我們在柬埔寨
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.760]  我們為什麼要去柬埔寨
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.760]  我們去柬埔寨
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.760]  因為柬埔寨的人
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.760]  不認識主耶穌
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.760]  是王
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.760]  他們不認識
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.760]  耶穌給他們
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.760]  的平安
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.760]  真正的平安
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.760]  這就是我們為什麼要去柬埔寨
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.760]  去祈禱
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.760]  耶穌是王
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.760]  耶穌是王
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.760]  我們現在看個影片
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.760]  我們看個影片
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.760]  我們做了什麼

[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:33.760]  (音樂)
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.760]  (歡呼聲)
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.760]  (歡呼聲)
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.760]  (歡呼聲)
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.760]  (歡呼聲)
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.760]  OK
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.760]  我們現在會分享下
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.760]  我們柬埔寨
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.760]  做什麼
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.760]  我們怎麼祈禱耶穌是王
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.760]  我們第一天

[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.760]  Christina
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.760]  和她的教會
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.760]  我們就和他們的小朋友
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.760]  一起分享
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.760]  主耶穌
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.760]  敬拜
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.760]  後幾天我們就去一個村
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.760]  Christina也開了一個教會
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.760]  在一個遠距離的村
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.760]  我們去身邊的
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.760]  不同的學校
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.760]  去和他們說
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.760]  主耶穌的故事
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.760]  和他們玩遊戲
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.760]  教他們耶穌愛我
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.760]  我們現在就分享
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.760]  我們請Isaac

[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.760]  (歡呼聲)
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.760]  (歡呼聲)
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.760]  Hello

[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.760]  我今天想分享一下
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.760]  我在Cambodia的一些經驗
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.760]  和體驗
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.760]  我們第一天就去看
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.760]  他們以前的一個歷史事件
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.760]  就是關於他們柬埔寨的
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.760]  屠殺事件
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.760]  一個很大型的屠殺
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.760]  那時候就去了
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.760]  那個叫萬人屠刑場的地方
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.760]  就看到很多
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.760]  很不人道的方法
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.760]  去殺了柬埔寨人
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.760]  因為那時候他們想去
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.760]  統治柬埔寨
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.760]  就用一些很殘忍的方式
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.760]  去殺害那些柬埔寨人
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.760]  逼柬埔寨人去殺柬埔寨人
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.760]  那時候看到
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.760]  我也覺得很傷心
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.760]  和很不開心
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.760]  我也覺得很傷心
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.760]  和有一點點情緒
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.760]  但我也有問過神
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.760]  為什麼神要我看到
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.760]  這樣的光景
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.760]  其實我想一想
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.760]  有可能祂想我知道
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.760]  人類的慾望
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.760]  有多恐怖
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.760]  還有如果我們真的
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.760]  不去跟隨神的道
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.760]  有可能會發生什麼事
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.760]  會墮落到什麼情況
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.760]  另一件事我想分享
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.760]  就是我們去不同的學校
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.760]  去做一些探訪
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.760]  本來我們是想去
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.760]  教歌
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.760]  教遊戲
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.760]  和講故事
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.760]  但是很不幸地
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.760]  一開始我們去
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.760]  試玩遊戲的時候
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.760]  才發覺
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.760]  原來那裡的環境
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.760]  不容許我們這樣做
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.760]  之後就令我覺得
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.760]  我沒有做過事
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.760]  就有點害怕
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.760]  不知道該怎麼做
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.760]  我就想
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.760]  我不應該靠自己
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.760]  其實我應該靠神幫助我
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.760]  之後我就去
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.760]  有禱告
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.760]  有尋求祂的
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.760]  道路和指引
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.760]  之後我也很成功
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.760]  在之後的幾天
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.760]  也順利一點
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.760]  還有做出一個不錯的表演
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.760]  也跟我們的團隊
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.760]  可以好好地商量
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.760]  一個更好的計劃
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.760]  也能令很多小朋友和學生
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.760]  聽到神的話語
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.760]  也接受神進入他們的生命之中
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.760]  我看到那一面的時候
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.760]  也覺得很感動和很欣慰
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.760]  我的分享就這樣
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.760]  謝謝
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:15.760]  我們很開心Issac來到這個短訓
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.760]  你知不知道Issac什麼時候信主的?
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.760]  他幾個月前信主的
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.760]  他以前回來這個教會
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.760]  但之後
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.760]  學校忙
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.760]  或者不同的情況下
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.760]  他就沒有回教會
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.760]  但他大學的時候
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.760]  有些不同的挑戰
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.760]  他的爸爸就邀請他
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.760]  六個月前回來
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.760]  我們的Barnabas團契
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.760]  Barnabas團契在不在?
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.760]  你好
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.760]  在不在?
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.760]  在不在?
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.760]  他就回到團契
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.760]  然後幾個月前
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.760]  我們幾個一起訓練
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.760]  之後我們就邀請Issac
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.760]  去信主耶穌
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.760]  作為他的主人和救贖
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.760]  很驚人
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.760]  他信了主之後
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.760]  他就投靠自己
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.760]  去服務主人
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.760]  宣佈耶穌是主人
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.760]  非常好
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.760]  我們給主人掌聲
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.760]  我們接著就請Vian去分享
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.760]  你給Vian掌聲
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:25.760]  我講的東西就有點不同
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.760]  其實都差不多
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.760]  都是講我怎樣信靠神
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.760]  去之前
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.760]  大家都問我你怕不怕
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.760]  其實我都跟他們說我不怕
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.760]  I am not scared
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.760]  因為我真的
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.760]  誰問我我都說我不怕
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.760]  其實我是怕的
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.760]  因為我媽媽已經在家
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.760]  所以如果她怕
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.760]  我怕就大家一起怕
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.760]  那就不怕
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.760]  所以我就會跟他們說我怕
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.760]  為什麼我怕呢
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.760]  因為首先
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.760]  減號債的名氣
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.760]  都不是太好
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.760]  相信大家都同意
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.760]  還有
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.760]  除了Christina
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.760]  我這團是甚麼
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.760]  男人男人男人
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.760]  女生
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.760]  所以很害怕
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.760]  這些
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.760]  所以
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.760]  他之前
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.760]  我沒有跟別人說
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.760]  但我是怕的
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.760]  接著去到
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.760]  第二天
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.760]  我們就去到學校
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.760]  第一就開始
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.760]  跟他們玩遊戲
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.760]  唱歌
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.760]  有些踢
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.760]  踢的時候
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.760]  我又怕
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.760]  第二天
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.760]  不是不開心
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.760]  但有些氣餒
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.760]  有些想
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.760]  有想過想回家
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.760]  或者
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.760]  跟自己說這會是長五天
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.760]  但
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.760]  在那天晚上
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.760]  我們就有
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.760]  在那個
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.760]  Devotion
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.760]  我讀了一個經
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.760]  我們就看了一個聖經
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.760]  Exodus四章
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.760]  總之就是說
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.760]  摩西那時候是神
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.760]  摩西說自己說話不厲害
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.760]  但因為神給我力量
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.760]  所以我就可以做
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.760]  那就是
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.760]  很舒服的提醒
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.760]  我都好像摩西
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.760]  我不需要相信我自己
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.760]  我只要相信神
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.760]  所以第三天
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.760]  第四天都很開心
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.760]  很順利
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.760]  我們就有300
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.760]  Kids
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.760]  我們就問他們有靈訊祈禱
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.760]  我們帶他們有
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.760]  接受耶穌
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.760]  的祈禱
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.760]  It was beautiful, amazing
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.760]  接著
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.760]  第五天我們就回到金邊
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.760]  就跟當地的教會的人
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.760]  剛才我們有跟他們唱歌
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.760]  玩Camping Toy 踢球
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.760]  我們都跟他們玩得很開心
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.760]  我記得第一天
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.760]  第二天我就說我想回家
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.760]  去到第五天的時候
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.760]  我已經不想回家
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.760]  我不想回家
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.760]  回到香港我每天都在說
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.760]  我想回去柬埔寨
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.760]  我很討厭香港
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.760]  我很喜歡香港
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.760]  但我更加想回去柬埔寨
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.760]  如果沒有Johnny
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.760]  Johnny會逼我來
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.760]  如果他沒有逼我來
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.760]  也沒有神推動他逼我來
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.760]  或者神也沒有鼓勵我
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.760]  我相信我在柬埔寨的經驗會很不同
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.760]  我不會在柬埔寨
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.760]  經歷到神
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.760]  經歷到He is King
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.760]  和他如何能夠在我的生活中
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.760]  能夠讓我感到有力
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.760]  所以
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.760]  大家去柬埔寨吧
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.760]  明年一起去
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.760]  Thank you
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.760]  (掌聲)
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.760]  現在我們給掌聲
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.760]  Nathan
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.760]  (掌聲)
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.760]  Hi 我是Nathan
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.760]  我講一下
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.760]  為什麼
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.760]  耶穌
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.760]  如何開了我的心
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.760]  讓我多點服務
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.760]  話說我幾個月前
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.760]  考了一個試叫DSE
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.760]  (笑聲)
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.760]  我為了準備DSE
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.760]  我其實沒有怎麼上教會
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.760]  沒有怎麼服務
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.760]  我覺得和耶穌有點遠離了
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.760]  但是
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.760]  在旅程中
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.760]  我不是很準備
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.760]  但一到第一天
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.760]  我看到
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.760]  那些
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.760]  學生在教堂
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.760]  煮了東西給我們
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.760]  我們就這樣站在那裡
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.760]  很尷尬
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.760]  為什麼學生會服務我們
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.760]  我們不是應該去柬埔寨服務別人
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.760]  那一刻我覺得
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.760]  之後的幾天
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.760]  我就要多點服務
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.760]  去那些學校
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.760]  給心情去服務
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.760]  之後
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.760]  在學校
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.760]  我看到很多人信主
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.760]  三百多個
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.760]  我也很感動
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.760]  令我有
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.760]  重新燃起熱誠
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.760]  我想分享
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.760]  基督徒的
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.760]  很棒的任務
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.760]  是做所有的國的徒弟
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.760]  之類
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.760]  我想
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.760]  呼籲大家也可以
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.760]  找你自己的任務去服務神
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.760]  (掌聲)
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:45.760]  我對我們的團隊很自豪
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.760]  他們踏上了
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.760]  踏上了信仰的步驟
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.760]  去柬埔寨是熱的
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.760]  去一個新的環境
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.760]  不容易的
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.760]  很多小朋友
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.760]  期望你教他們的東西是不容易的
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.760]  但他們用信心
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.760]  去侍奉神
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.760]  我看到他們成長了很多
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.760]  讓我們給這些學生們掌聲
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.760]  我想邀請Christina
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.760]  Christina是我們一起合作的
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.760]  宣教士
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.760]  她真的踏上了信仰的步驟
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.760]  給她掌聲
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.760]  我們2019年
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.760]  和Rosalind
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.760]  你不知道
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.760]  Jeffery
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.760]  Ken一起去柬埔寨
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.760]  2019年
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.760]  三四年前
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.760]  我們聽到Christina
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.760]  很有信心
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.760]  很有心去帶柬埔寨人
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.760]  去信著耶穌
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.760]  她自己
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.760]  她自己
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.760]  給自己的錢
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.760]  去幫助建立學校
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.760]  幫助建立教會
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.760]  讓柬埔寨人認識耶穌
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.760]  我們來聽聽她的說話
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.760]  給她掌聲
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.760]  大家好
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.760]  我的時間不是很多
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.760]  我想請所有小朋友
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.760]  放下你的手機
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.760]  因為你要聽我說話
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.760]  你放下你的手機
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.760]  2001年
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.760]  我第一次去柬埔寨
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.760]  2014年
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.760]  開始這個時工
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.760]  2013年上帝和我說話
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.760]  我想問問大家
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.760]  上帝有沒有和你說話
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.760]  有沒有聽到神和你說話
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.760]  神真的和我說話
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.760]  神和我說去柬埔寨
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.760]  為小朋友提供教育
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.760]  我問神
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.760]  天父你是不是真的叫我去做這件事
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.760]  我說如果你叫我去做這件事
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.760]  你要給我有
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.760]  憑據
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.760]  confirmation
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.760]  上帝真的回應了我
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.760]  讓我收到
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.760]  祂的憑據
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.760]  所以我在鼓勵大家
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.760]  年輕人我來到這裡
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.760]  我看到你們我很開心
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.760]  因為我都曾經年輕過
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.760]  我來到這裡
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.760]  我的年歲馬上年輕了
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.760]  時間很有限
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.760]  不過我想告訴大家
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.760]  他們會再去
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.760]  我會在這裡邀請你們去
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.760]  我看到你們這麼多小朋友
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.760]  我就很想你們帶小朋友去玩
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.760]  我們有幾百個小朋友
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.760]  一條村裡面有兩千個小朋友
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.760]  他們還沒有信耶穌
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.760]  你可以帶他們
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.760]  認識耶穌基督
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.760]  你願不願意一人一身
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.760]  一年宣教
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.760]  放下一年去侍奉上帝
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.760]  因為上帝要祝福你
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.760]  Thank you
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.760]  (掌聲)
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:43.760]  在旅程中
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.760]  我們看到三百個學生
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.760]  第一天來認識耶穌
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.760]  三百個學生
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.760]  然後第二天
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.760]  後一天在教會
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.760]  我們邀請村裡的小朋友
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.760]  進來教會
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.760]  我們和他們分享玩
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.760]  那天
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.760]  有七十個小朋友
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.760]  去祈禱
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.760]  我們一起

[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.760]  這些信了的小朋友
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.760]  去祈禱
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.760]  我們請Irene教主
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.760]  為這些柬埔寨的
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.760]  缺志的小朋友去祈禱
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.760]  Let's pray for them
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.760]  我們一起有個祈禱
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.760]  七十天父上帝
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.760]  我們真的透過
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.760]  這次柬埔寨的宣教
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.760]  讓我們看到
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.760]  讓我們跨出
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.760]  這個安書區
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.760]  憑著祢給我們的信心
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.760]  帶領這麼多的小朋友
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.760]  歸向祢
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.760]  求主祢都堅定
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.760]  這三百多個小朋友的信心
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.760]  讓他們走在祢的道路當中
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.760]  真的道路都不偏離
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.760]  讓他們靠著祢的能力
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.760]  靠著對祢的信心
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.760]  去繼續學習
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.760]  繼續生活
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.760]  求主同樣都給這份信心
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.760]  在座每一個探索者
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.760]  讓他們真的走在
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.760]  這個信心的路上
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.760]  在他們的一生
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.760]  一無懼怕
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.760]  願主你親自與我們同在
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.760]  我們同心禱告
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.760]  奉主明求
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.760]  好 最後
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.760]  我想給你們三個字
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.760]  The first word
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.760]  is surrender
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.760]  Is Jesus king of your life?
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.760]  Who is king of your life?
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.760]  Who is king of your life?
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.760]  是不是打遊戲機
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.760]  是不是Instagram
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.760]  What is the king of your life?
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.760]  Have you surrendered to Jesus
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.760]  as the king of your life?
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.760]  Is your studies your king?
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.760]  Is tennis your king?
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.760]  可以打tennis
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.760]  可以讀書
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.760]  但如果耶穌不是第一位
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.760]  在你的生命
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.760]  That is an idol
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.760]  over Jesus
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.760]  Who is king of your life?
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.760]  Have you surrendered to the king?
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.760]  That ye imitate
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.760]  If you surrender to the king
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.760]  Are you willing to imitate the king
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.760]  To serve
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.760]  To serve
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.760]  To bring peace
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.760]  第三
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.760]  Proclaim
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.760]  Are you willing to proclaim
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.760]  That Jesus is king
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.760]  King over this world
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.760]  King over your life
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.760]  Alright
