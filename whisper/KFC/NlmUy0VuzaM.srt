1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 Good evening.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,560
 Well thank you Pastor John for that lovely skit.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,560
 Who enjoyed it?

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
 Raise your hands.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
 Yeah?

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,560
 You enjoyed it?

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,560
 Yeah?

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
 Very good.

9
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,560
 All right, my hat just dropped.

10
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,560
 It's okay.

11
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,560
 All good.

12
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,960
 We are doing a character study.

13
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,480
 We're doing a character study.

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,880
 And last week we talked about this girl named Mary.

15
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,200
 There's something about Mary.

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,720
 And Pastor John reminded us last week that the story of Christmas is about somebody who

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,000
 became nobody so that somebodies can be somebodies.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:55,240
 And Jesus came so that Mary could be a symbol, a symbol and a servant for the Lord.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,000
 And Pastor John last week talked about the calling of Mary.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,280
 This innocent girl, teenage girl in her innocence, yet God chose her and she stood in faith to

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,400
 receive this calling from the Lord.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,680
 Today we are going to talk about Joseph.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,920
 Joseph, the father of Jesus.

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,440
 And what do we know about Joseph?

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,880
 What was his occupation?

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,880
 What did he do?

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,280
 Was he the CEO of IBM?

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
 Google?

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,280
 No?

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,240
 Was he like a football coach?

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
 No.

32
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,000
 He was a carpenter.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,480
 Who does carpentry here?

34
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
 Anybody do company?

35
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,840
 Oh, what do you make?

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,160
 Uncle Vincent.

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
 Anything?

38
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
 Wow.

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,040
 Can you make a house?

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,880
 Can you make a manger?

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
 Okay.

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,560
 All right.

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,600
 Very good.

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,840
 And so what we know about Joseph is that he was a carpenter.

45
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:04,240
 And what we know is that he likely died early because he wasn't there as Jesus begun his

46
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,840
 ministry.

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
 He wasn't there.

48
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:14,680
 He was only Mary at the resurrection, at the death and the resurrection was only Mary,

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,200
 the mother of Mary.

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,840
 And so Bonnie did an amazing job reading for us about the birth of Jesus.

51
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,200
 Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found

52
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,880
 to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.

53
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:40,320
 Now imagine, right, you're going to marry somebody for those who've been married and

54
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:48,520
 you find out that this girl is pregnant and it must have been shocking for Joseph, right?

55
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,560
 Imagine you're a fiance, you're about to get married and she's pregnant and you haven't

56
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,200
 done anything with her, right?

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,520
 It must have been shocking.

58
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,600
 How do you think Joseph would have felt?

59
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
 How do you think?

60
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
 Shocked?

61
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
 Betrayed?

62
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
 Maybe angry?

63
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
 Mad?

64
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
 How could this happen?

65
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
 I would feel so betrayed.

66
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 And so this was Mary's situation, that she was pregnant before she was married.

67
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:23,600
 And so there would have been all sorts of social dilemmas, social circumstances happening

68
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
 because of this, right?

69
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
 What would have the parents would have thought, right?

70
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
 What would have Joseph's parents would have thought?

71
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
 What would have the parents of Mary thought?

72
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
 What would have Joseph's parents would have thought?

73
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
 What would have her friends and family would have thought?

74
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
 Like, how could this happen?

75
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
 Mary, we thought you were a good girl, right?

76
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
 What happened, Mary?

77
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
 What were you thinking, Mary?

78
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
 Right?

79
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
 And so this was Mary's situation.

80
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
 And so Joseph's dilemma would have been this.

81
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,600
 How could I marry a girl that's already pregnant?

82
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
 How would it make him look?

83
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,600
 Like he did something with her before they got married, that they would be unclean, right?

84
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
 Joseph's laughing.

85
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,600
 He assumed that the child was somebody else's, right?

86
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
 Like, Mary, who you been?

87
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
 Who are you with?

88
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,600
 You know, the last couple of days or the last couple of weeks or the last couple of months, right?

89
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
 He would have been questioning these things.

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
 And so this would have been happening in Joseph's mind.

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:40,600
 And so the first thing we see about Joseph, that it says in the Bible that he chose, he was going to divorce her privately.

92
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
 Okay?

93
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,600
 So that meant maybe not get married with her or get married and quickly divorce her.

94
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 Joseph could have brought shame to Mary, right?

95
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:02,600
 Women who are unclean or have, or are pregnant before married, getting married, you know,

96
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,600
 there's certain connotations associated with these women.

97
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,600
 But Joseph chose not to bring public disgrace to her.

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
 He wanted this to go quietly.

99
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:25,600
 And so it shows that Joseph had some sort of kindness, sensitivity, consideration towards Mary.

100
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
 He hadn't done anything wrong, right?

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
 He knew that, right?

102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
 He knew he was innocent.

103
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
 Mary, he wasn't sure about.

104
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
 And he could have assumed different things.

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,600
 But he chose to divorce her quietly.

106
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,600
 His thinking was to divorce her quietly.

107
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
 Next, we read about Joseph's dream.

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
 Who had a dream last night?

109
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
 Anybody have a dream last night?

110
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
 Yeah?

111
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
 Did you dream about Joseph?

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
 (laughing)

113
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
 I had a dream, but I don't remember.

114
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
 Do you guys remember your dream?

115
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
 Anybody remember your dream?

116
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
 It's really hard to remember your dream, right?

117
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,600
 Unless you think about it right away, and you start like thinking about it,

118
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
 then you might remember it.

119
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
 I feel like that's how you remember it.

120
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,600
 But anyways, Joseph remembered his dream.

121
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
 And what did he dream about?

122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
 Well, an angel spoke to him, right?

123
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
 Let's read it once together.

124
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
 One, two, three.

125
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,600
 "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife,

126
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,600
 because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,600
 She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,

128
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,600
 because he will save his people from their sins."

129
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,600
 Joseph did remember this dream, and he remembered it clearly.

130
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,600
 So clearly that Matthew, the writer, wrote it down.

131
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,600
 And you see in this next picture, it's a painting of Joseph sleeping,

132
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,600
 and the angel in his dream, as you see in the next photo.

133
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
 You see it yet? No? Okay. Next photo. Yeah. There you go. That's the dream.

134
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,600
 And so what do you think Joseph's options are at this point after the dream?

135
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,600
 Well, the first option would be to listen to the angel, right?

136
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,600
 Okay, I just woke up. I had this dream.

137
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,600
 It must be true. I feel like it must be true.

138
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,600
 An angel spoke directly about this issue.

139
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,600
 Who's had a problem in their life, and they've dreamt about it?

140
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,600
 Have they dreamt and then dreamt solutions about this?

141
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,600
 Who's had an issue, and this issue was so stuck in their mind

142
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
 that they started to dream about it?

143
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,600
 Hanani did. Anybody else? Yeah? You've dreamt about it, right?

144
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,600
 Sometimes you keep thinking about things before bed,

145
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,600
 and you dream about it afterwards. It happens.

146
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,600
 So maybe Joseph could have questioned his dream.

147
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
 Did I really dream, or was I dreaming about a problem

148
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,600
 that I was thinking about before I slept?

149
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,600
 So he could have continued with the divorce,

150
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,600
 be like, "You know, this dream is probably not something I should believe in."

151
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,600
 But he chose to believe in this dream,

152
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,600
 and he chose to believe in the angel.

153
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:34,600
 And so it shows that Joseph is a God-fearing man,

154
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
 a God-fearing father.

155
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 He chose to follow the angel's instructions.

156
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,600
 Now, it would have been easier to divorce her quietly, right?

157
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,600
 Like, "This woman was pregnant before I got married."

158
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,600
 There's all sort of social connotations that come with that.

159
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,600
 And to divorce her quietly, I did nothing wrong.

160
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,600
 It would have been the easier way out.

161
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,600
 But to marry some, to marry Mary,

162
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,600
 and to have her pregnant already, he would have had to do some explaining,

163
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:15,600
 just like Pastor John had to explain to his mother, right, on the cell phone.

164
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,600
 And so there, it would have been harder, actually, I believe.

165
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,600
 It would have been harder to have to explain to your friends,

166
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,600
 to your family what has happened,

167
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,600
 and to convince them that, "No, I've not been drinking.

168
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
 I have not been smoking," whatever.

169
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
 Pastor John said he was smoking.

170
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 But that he was actually chosen.

171
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,600
 He and Mary were chosen by the Lord to parent the Messiah,

172
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
 to be the father of Jesus.

173
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,600
 So we see that Joseph is kind-hearted, considerate.

174
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,600
 We see that Joseph is God-fearing.

175
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 The last thing we see about Joseph is that he was a father,

176
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
 a protecting father.

177
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
 Let's read together one more time.

178
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
 One, two, three.

179
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,600
 "After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream

180
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
 to Joseph in Egypt and said,

181
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,600
 'Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel,

182
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
 for those who are trying to take the child's life are dead.'"

183
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
 Who was trying to take the child's life?

184
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
 Herod.

185
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,600
 And Herod was the king at that time that the Romans had put forth.

186
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
 Now, King Herod, he was shaking in his boots, right,

187
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
 because there were prophecies that a king was born.

188
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
 And what did he have his soldiers do?

189
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,600
 He had all the soldiers go and kill the children in Bethlehem.

190
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
 That's unheard of.

191
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
 That's genocide.

192
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
 And this is a painting, right, of a mother.

193
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,600
 Imagine being a mother and you have a child under the age of two or three,

194
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
 and you're trying to hide that child,

195
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
 because soldiers are coming for that child,

196
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,600
 to kill that child on the order of Herod,

197
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
 who is so afraid of this coming king,

198
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,600
 because he wants to keep his authority.

199
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,600
 Joseph is a protecting father.

200
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,600
 He chose to take Jesus to Egypt to hide the child.

201
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,600
 And so we see three things from Joseph.

202
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,600
 The first thing is that he is kind, considerate.

203
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
 Of the situation he was in,

204
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
 with Mary being pregnant before they were going to get married.

205
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
 He is God-fearing.

206
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,600
 He chose to listen to the angel.

207
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
 He is a protecting father.

208
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
 A protecting father.

209
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,600
 And Joseph is a symbol of a great father.

210
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,600
 And when I think of fathers, I think of Pastor John.

211
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
 You know, he's a great spiritual father to some of us.

212
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
 Who thinks he's a spiritual father to you? Raise your hand.

213
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
 Yeah, he's a spiritual father.

214
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
 Yeah, he's a spiritual father to me.

215
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
 Hi, Pastor John.

216
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,600
 And I've seen him many times go out of his way to help somebody.

217
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
 Right? Somebody in need, he would go out of his way

218
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
 just to care for that person, just to call that person,

219
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
 to give to that person,

220
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 to be a father's heart, to give a father's heart,

221
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
 a hug to that person.

222
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,600
 Pastor John is a great example of a spiritual father to us.

223
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,600
 Some people, you know, can be (speaks in foreign language)

224
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
 Right? He says that.

225
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
 Some people can be (speaks in foreign language)

226
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,600
 But he goes out of his way to help them, pray for them,

227
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,600
 be considerate, kind towards them.

228
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,600
 And when I think about a God-fearing father,

229
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
 I actually think of my own father.

230
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
 You see the next picture, my own father.

231
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,600
 And I shared this story.

232
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
 You've seen this picture before, no?

233
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,600
 Okay, all right.

234
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,600
 I think of my father as a God-fearing father.

235
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 I've shared this story before.

236
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
 He studied in a Christian school, middle school or high school

237
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
 in Hong Kong.

238
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,600
 And his idol was, do you guys remember who his idol was?

239
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,600
 A Kung Fu master named Bruce Lee, right?

240
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
 Wah!

241
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
 Right? Yellow suit.

242
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:53,600
 And he learned that Bruce Lee had, suddenly had cancer.

243
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
 Right? He had cancer, yeah?

244
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
 No, he didn't have cancer.

245
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
 Sorry, what happened to him?

246
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
 He died, sorry.

247
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
 He didn't have cancer.

248
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
 I was testing you.

249
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,600
 I was testing you.

250
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,600
 You see?

251
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
 He didn't have cancer.

252
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
 He just died suddenly, okay?

253
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,600
 Maybe too many raw eggs or something, or something, I don't know.

254
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
 Too much pressure from Hollywood.

255
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
 I don't know.

256
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
 It's a conspiracy.

257
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
 Uncle Vincent's on that conspiracy.

258
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 You can talk to him about it afterwards.

259
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,600
 And at the same time, he learned Bruce Lee died.

260
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,600
 He had some sort of tumor on his wrist.

261
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,600
 And so he was so afraid of death, right?

262
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,600
 And so at that time, he was studying Christian studies,

263
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,600
 and he was getting top marks, and Christians in that class were telling him

264
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
 to believe in God.

265
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 And he's like, "No, I don't need to believe in God.

266
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,600
 I have higher Christian marks than you in religious class."

267
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,600
 But that incident of Bruce Lee dying and him possibly having cancer

268
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,600
 shocked him to his core, and he chose to put his faith in Jesus.

269
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,600
 And he received a calling from Jesus to go into seminary.

270
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,600
 And you know how Asian parents are, right?

271
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,600
 My grandmother, what should he study?

272
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 He should be a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer, right?

273
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:23,600
 But he told his parents, my grandparents, that he was going to go to seminary.

274
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,600
 And how do you think my grandparents reacted?

275
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
 Not happy, right?

276
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 My grandmother was crying, like, "What are you doing?

277
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
 Don't go."

278
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
 My dad was threatening to kick him out of the house,

279
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,600
 but he chose to fear the Lord even more than he chose to fear his parents,

280
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:49,600
 kicking him out of the house, an example of a God-fearing father.

281
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,600
 And I actually chose myself as an example of a protecting father.

282
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,600
 I don't know why, but back in 2016, when I played basketball,

283
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
 there would be a fight a week.

284
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
 It doesn't really happen that much anymore.

285
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
 But back in 2016, when I did my internship here,

286
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
 there would be a fight a week.

287
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,600
 These older basketball players picked on younger players, right?

288
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,600
 And they were so sensitive about fouls or whatnot.

289
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,600
 And many times, I would even go over to another court.

290
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 I was playing basketball in one court, and I saw a fight emerging.

291
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,600
 I would just walk over and just stop them, right?

292
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,600
 I would put out two hands like Iron Man and just, like, stop them, right?

293
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
 Like this, right?

294
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,600
 Like there was a civil war, and I would just stop them, right?

295
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
 And then I would tell the younger kid, usually, just, "Oh, just walk away.

296
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
 They're a little bit, you know, crazy.

297
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
 Just walk away."

298
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
 And that would be that.

299
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,600
 I would actually take the protecting father role.

300
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,600
 And my friends would be like, "Whoa, what were you doing?

301
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
 You just got up and stopped that fight?"

302
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 And I'm like, "Yeah, why didn't you help?"

303
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,600
 They were just, you know, sitting there, drinking water and resting.

304
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,600
 And so there's so many good examples of fathers in our life.

305
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
 It could be Pastor John.

306
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
 It could be my own father.

307
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,600
 It could be me in the basketball court.

308
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:29,600
 But the ultimate example of a heavenly father, an ultimate example of an

309
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,600
 amazing father is our heavenly father.

310
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:41,600
 You know, me, Pastor John, my dad, Joseph, we are just a glimpse of how amazing

311
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
 our heavenly father is.

312
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:50,600
 As kind and considerate as Pastor John is and has as big of a heart as he has to

313
00:17:50,600 --> 00:18:01,600
 love us and to be our spiritual father, our heavenly father is a thousand times more.

314
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,600
 As God-fearing as my dad is, you know, our heavenly father, Jesus, is an example

315
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,600
 a thousand times more.

316
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,600
 As protecting as I am of some of the kids and teens on the basketball court,

317
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:25,600
 Jesus is a hundred--our heavenly father is a thousand times more protecting of you.

318
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:33,600
 And that's what I want us to understand today, that we have an amazing father.

319
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,600
 I don't know how your biological father is and how your relationship with him is

320
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:47,600
 in your life, but I'm here to tell you that you have an amazing heavenly father

321
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,600
 who is perfect in love and in kindness.

322
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
 He knows your heart.

323
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
 He knows the struggles that you're going through.

324
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,600
 He knows the things that are on your mind that are weighing you down.

325
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
 And he is a protecting father.

326
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,600
 He wants to protect you.

327
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:17,600
 If you step into obedience, if you come into his arms, he is there for you.

328
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
 And he wants to bless you.

329
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:27,600
 And the blessing might not come in this life on earth, but the blessing may come

330
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:34,600
 eventually in eternity in heaven where there is going to be a perfect,

331
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,600
 perfect life with him in eternity.

332
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
 There's this song as the band comes up.

333
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
 I want to remind you of the song.

334
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
 It says this.

335
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
 Let's read it together, actually.

336
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
 One, two, three.

337
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
 I run to the father.

338
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
 I fall into grace.

339
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
 I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait.

340
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
 My heart needs a surgeon.

341
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
 My soul needs a friend.

342
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,600
 So I run to the father again and again.

343
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:11,600
 Are you in need of a father's love, a father's heart?

344
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,600
 Are you in need of a father's protection, a father's kindness?

345
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 Would you consider running to the father?

346
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
 Joseph was an amazing father.

347
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
 Pastor John is an amazing father.

348
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,600
 My dad is an amazing father.

349
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,600
 But the best father of all is our heavenly father.

350
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,600
 Would you run to him?

351
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:49,600
 Would you fall into his grace, fall into his arms?

352
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,600
 Would you bring him your struggles?

353
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,600
 Would you bring him your pain?

354
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,600
 Would you soak in his love?

355
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:06,600
 That is the father that is speaking to you tonight,

356
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:13,600
 that loves you, that wants to hold you,

357
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,600
 that understands you.

358
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,600
 Let's take a moment and just embrace our father's arms,

359
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
 heavenly father.

360
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:52,600
 [music]

361
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:59,600
 Heavenly father, we thank you for the story of Joseph

362
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,600
 and how an amazing father he was to Jesus.

363
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 We thank you that it points us towards you,

364
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:19,600
 a kind, loving, protecting father who welcomes us into your arms.

365
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,600
 We thank you for Christmas, that ultimately you sent Jesus

366
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,600
 to protect us from sin, to save us from sin.

367
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,600
 We thank you for Christmas that you sent Jesus

368
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,600
 out of your love and kindness for us.

369
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,600
 We thank you that you call us to obedience, to God-fearing,

370
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,600
 so that we may be blessed by you,

371
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,600
 whether in this life or in eternity.

372
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,600
 In Christ's name we pray.

373
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,600
 And the church said, "Amen."

374
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
 Let us rise and respond in this song.
