[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   And thank you, Hank, for reading that.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.720]   Now I was trying to get a wise man to read the passage, and I think we did get one.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.720]   Now good evening.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.840]   So I'm just really glad to be here as we continue this series.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.080]   And as we've just read, it's about the wise man or the magi, or sometimes if I mistakenly,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.940]   I would say Maggie.
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.980]   So anyways, if you'll hear all those, we're referring to the wise man.
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.440]   But before we start, I do want to ask you a few questions, okay?
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:45.920]   Which is, now, if we were to think of a wise man in the movie Star Wars, okay, which character
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.080]   would it be?
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.000]   Now I want to give you a hint, okay, which is it's not Darth Vader, okay?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.080]   Now who would it be if you were to choose someone, a character?
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.080]   Huh?
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.080]   Yoda.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.080]   Yes, it's Master Yoda.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.680]   Let's get him on, Master Yoda.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.760]   And he is this green-looking, small alien, and yet he possess this power that he's able
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.320]   to train all of the master Jedis.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.240]   But nowhere do we know where he came from, and he's classified as the unknown species.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.000]   All right, another chance if you didn't get the first one.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.120]   So what about in the movie Matrix?
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.040]   If we were to find a character that would resemble the wise man or wise woman, who would
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.040]   it be?
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.360]   Now I also have a clue for you, and that is not Agent Smith, okay?
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.760]   All right, if you're laughing, that means you know what I'm talking about, but does
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.120]   anybody have any idea who the wise person is?
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.380]   Yes.
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.280]   So the Oracle, I heard it.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.280]   Good job.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.000]   This is a collective wisdom here, okay?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.200]   So it is the Oracle, the one on the right.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.800]   And she possessed the power to tell the future, or she knows what's going to happen, of course
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.040]   up to the free will of that person.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.160]   All right, the next question.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.840]   And of course we don't know much about her either, but that she helps the people to fight
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.440]   against this matrix.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.680]   So the last chance if you didn't get the first two.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.440]   Now who would be the wise man in KFC?
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.760]   Okay, all right.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.080]   Okay, don't answer that one, okay?
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.240]   There are too many.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.640]   That's the answer.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.960]   And so when we talk about wise men, we tend to think of someone kind of mysterious.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.520]   We don't know much about...
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.440]   This picture comes to mind, right?
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.520]   But somehow they possess some sort of power or knowledge that's beyond the average population.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.080]   So this is the kind of wise man or the magi that we're also looking at today.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.840]   Now the magi that we were looking at, we saw that they possessed this power and they were
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.240]   able to see what the stars meant.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.000]   They were able to link it together with the birth of the King of Jews.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.400]   And I believe that, and also with many scholars, we're going to show here the prophecy by Balaam,
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.600]   which is in Numbers 24, 17, where it says that, "I see him, but not now.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.840]   I behold him, but not near.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.280]   A star will come out of Jacob.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.800]   A scepter will rise out of Israel."
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.880]   Now we believe that he was able to connect that star with his astronomic knowledge and
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.280]   see that it is the King of Jews.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.560]   And yet he is not a Jew himself, at least not set by the Bible, but he's just someone
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.200]   who came from the East.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.920]   And as far as we know, it's probably about 900 miles away.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.960]   Now what does that mean?
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.480]   How long is 900 miles?
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.720]   Anybody know?
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.040]   How many hours of drive is that, 900 miles?
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.320]   Driving at the speed of 65 kilometers an hour.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.040]   If you're not speeding, you'll get there within 14 hours of drive.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.660]   So it actually took them about several months to get there.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.480]   And so in this story, as it unfolds, we see that they were looking for this infant Jesus,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.720]   and then where would they go?
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.800]   It actually was quite logical for them to go to Jerusalem because that was the city
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.040]   of the royalties.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.880]   That's where even King David was born.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.560]   So it's natural for them, if they're looking for the King, to go there first.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.880]   But instead of finding Jesus, they found King Herod and alert him that there is this King
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.080]   who was born.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.880]   And so as the story unfolds, Herod tells him by asking all the priests and the teachers
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.320]   of law, where would he be?
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.140]   And we know from the prophecies that he's going to be born, or he was born, in Bethlehem.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.540]   And so they head out, and the star reappeared, and eventually landed in the home where Mary
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.240]   was with Jesus.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:19.160]   And they bow down to him, and he served, and they gave homage to him, really just to praise
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.600]   him and to give him these gifts.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.040]   So this is kind of how this story started.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.920]   And eventually, then they've received a dream from the angels telling them, "Don't go there.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.820]   Don't go back to Herod, but instead, go to another route."
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.760]   And Joseph also received a dream from the angels telling him to flee with Mary and Jesus
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.680]   to Egypt.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.500]   And so after King Herod found out, what did he do?
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.400]   He killed all of the infants around the age under two years old in Bethlehem.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.400]   So we kind of have this setting.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.340]   I just wanted to make sure that we're all on the same page about what's happening.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.340]   Now the very first thing that I do want to say is that today we're going to focus on
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:12.300]   how these wise men had worshipped God in a way that maybe you and I haven't, and for
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.980]   us to have a glimpse.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.460]   So when I say the word "worship," I mean, what do you think of?
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.460]   How do we worship?
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.460]   What is worship?
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.460]   Anyone?
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.460]   Throw some answers out.
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.460]   How do you...
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.460]   Huh?
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.460]   - Praying.
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.460]   - Praying.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.940]   Okay, thank you, Jackie, all the way from back there.
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.980]   What about up front on this side?
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.980]   What else?
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.980]   - Praises.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.980]   - Praises, okay, singing songs or going to church.
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.660]   So we'll see the slide where we see that there are different ways and we picture what worship
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.660]   is like.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.780]   However, today we're going to see it quite differently than from what these magi, these
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.300]   wise men are showing us.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:58.860]   And the very first point that we want to go to is that it is important for us to worship
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.180]   God as a priority.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.300]   Now they have done so in a few ways, okay?
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.660]   The first way that they have set God as a priority was as soon as they saw the star,
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.040]   they head out to find this newborn.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   Now think about it.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.820]   If you and I were in their shoes, even with all the expertise that we have, we're looking
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.340]   at a star and I've looked at many stars and they all look pretty much the same, okay?
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.820]   And how do they with certainty know that this is the star of the newborn king?
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.180]   I mean, when we look up, does it have an arrow that says, "This is it," and it's got a title,
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.300]   Star of the King of Jews?
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.300]   Probably not.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.380]   So there might be some doubt, you know, is that really the star?
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.540]   But anyways, let's say for argument's sake, let's say they're 100% sure this is the star.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.400]   So they start heading out.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.420]   But won't you and I, if we were them, start to have doubt?
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.180]   Are we really going to find this infant?
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.900]   I mean, it's miles and miles away and we're not sure if we're going to be robbed along
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.900]   the way or killed.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.480]   And I mean, when we get there, we will really find him?
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:15.140]   So the first thing that I want us to look at is that we need to prioritize God over
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.660]   any doubts that we have.
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.420]   Maybe sometimes there are doubts in your life too.
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.840]   Maybe situations are not exactly how you want them to be.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:32.020]   But will we be able to, like the wise men, just not to fear, but then to take a risk
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:38.780]   with God, knowing that when we prioritize him, even in the midst of doubt, I mean, even
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:46.060]   if they didn't find him, they were willing to go all the way to find Jesus.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:52.620]   Will we, in the midst especially of our trials, have this priority?
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:57.620]   And the second thing is he prioritized his time.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.620]   Now think about it.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.460]   It was a few months worth of travel.
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.820]   I don't know about you, but I think they would have their own family, maybe a job.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.740]   And these are most likely religious leaders or political leaders, and they have their
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.040]   duties to perform.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.740]   And what did they do?
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.380]   They put down everything, their entire timetable.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.100]   And it's also a question for us to think about.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.020]   I mean, do we put down our timetable?
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:32.620]   I mean, do we go through the business of our day, and eventually we get to nighttime and
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.420]   we carve out that two minutes that we pray to God?
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:43.660]   Or do we carve out the best of our timetable, putting everything aside to ensure that we
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.500]   have quality time with him?
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:56.180]   And the third thing that we see is that the wise men prioritize God before anyone.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.500]   Now think about it.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.820]   When they were about to travel back, they would have gone back to Herald.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.700]   But instead, because of what the angel said, they did not go back to Herald and went another
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.700]   way.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.180]   But think about it.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:16.780]   They have actually risked their lives to do that because Herald is a king.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:23.900]   And if he knew that these wise men have played him, he could easily send out troops or soldiers
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.860]   to go after them.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:32.620]   And yet, the wise men were willing to prioritize God first.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.000]   And that's something for us to think about.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.500]   Do we prioritize what God says, or do we care more about what people think of us?
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:48.060]   Do we care more about whether or not we'll get fired at our job or get higher grades
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.200]   or other benefits?
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.820]   And that's something for us to think about.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:11:00.060]   So the first one I really want to share is that we need to prioritize God in our worship.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:05.480]   Whether it's our time, whether it's people that we care about, or rather it's in those
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.820]   moments where we have doubts.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.600]   We still need to prioritize him.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:17.340]   Now as we read on, we see that as the wise men went and they went to Bethlehem, they
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:23.360]   saw this house and there was an infant, a toddler, because Jesus was most likely not
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.980]   in his baby stage, but closer to a year old or a year and a half.
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:35.480]   And what we see is in verse 11 it says, "On coming to the house, they saw the child with
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.640]   his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshipped him.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:45.780]   Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.520]   myrrh."
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.440]   And now at seeing Jesus, they didn't walk in and start sitting down and having a cup
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.560]   of tea and chat with Mary, how are things going?
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.880]   They don't see themselves at the same level, but what they did immediately was they bowed
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.200]   down because this is the king that they have been searching.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.560]   This is the king of Jews.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:14.880]   And so immediately also they brought out the gifts that they have for Jesus.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.760]   Of course my question to you and also to me is, what about us?
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:27.760]   When we go to worship God, do we have this kind of reverence for God?
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.120]   I mean, one thing is, I mean, how on time do we come for worship?
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.160]   Okay, don't answer that, you know it yourself.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.600]   Or how willing are we to give to God?
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:45.660]   Do we give the treasures that we cherish the most?
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.120]   Or instead, do we not even have a gift?
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.880]   Maybe many a times we don't have a gift for this king.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.320]   What do we have for him?
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.720]   Do you know?
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.680]   We have our troubles, our issues, things we can't take care of, our health problems.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.200]   That's what we bring to him.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.760]   We're not bringing him any gift.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.760]   Well, sometimes we do.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.120]   And so that's also for us to think about.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:22.640]   Looking at the wise men, they went all the way, not with their problems, but with gifts.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.360]   And this baby Jesus, he's a toddler.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.560]   He's not going to perform miracles and they're not doing anything.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.920]   But really just to praise him.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:42.000]   And you know, these three kinds of items, these gifts that they have, is fit for someone
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.520]   very special.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.920]   It's fit for a king.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.680]   It's fit for a savior.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.640]   It's fit for God.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.720]   Now let's look at that.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.960]   So the first thing is gold.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.960]   Okay.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:59.440]   Gold as we know is the ultimate, most valuable element in those times.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.280]   And so they're presenting the most precious thing to him.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:09.520]   And really many scholars also say that this might symbolize the identity of who Jesus
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.080]   was and is, which is the king.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.560]   Jesus is the king.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.640]   And so they brought gold for him for this particular identity.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.480]   And the next thing is, is frankincense.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.560]   Now frankincense is a rosin from a particular tree.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.800]   It was actually an imported good.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   Okay.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:34.080]   And what it was used for is that it's burnt incense during the worship.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:40.120]   And so this particular gift was made for God.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:46.080]   So it's really worshiping him as the God of the universe.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.640]   And the last thing is myrrh.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.960]   It is actually used for the embalmment of dead bodies.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:15:00.040]   And many say that it probably represented the suffering and the death and the resurrection
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.420]   of Jesus.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:08.480]   And what that meant was that they were worshiping him as a savior.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   That identity.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.920]   Now, rather or not, these wise men knew what they were presenting.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.600]   We don't really know.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.840]   But what we do see is that these are great gifts.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.400]   And what about us?
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.760]   Today, what do we have prepared for Jesus, for God?
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.280]   What about you?
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:34.240]   And sometimes, you know, I think for myself, you know, when I tithe, I might forget this
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:40.360]   week's tithe and I might write it for next month instead or the month after that.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:46.880]   But how many of us actually prepare our checks, maybe even before our paycheck comes, and
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.480]   they're ready to tithe their first fruits, their best part of it to God?
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.840]   Or when we talk about serving God or volunteering, how many of us are like, "Yeah, the church
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.720]   needs that and I'm going to serve there next week."
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.400]   Yes, the vesters clapping.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   Right?
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.400]   Or we're like, "Oh, you know, think about it.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.200]   Maybe if no one goes, you know."
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.480]   And like we're serving God if it's like out of pity.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.600]   Or maybe because you don't want to see that announcement anymore.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.280]   And then you go and serve, right?
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.440]   But look at these wise men.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.240]   They were not like that.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.520]   They were traveling all the way.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:29.400]   They were prepared to give what they have to God.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.720]   And so let us be reminded of that as well.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:41.320]   And there's a great expression that John Piper eloquently puts together.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.440]   And I want to share that with you.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:50.360]   And it says, "The gifts are intensifiers of desire for Christ himself."
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:56.560]   In much the same way that fasting is, when you give a gift to Christ like this, it's
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:03.240]   a way of saying, "The joy that I pursue is not the hope of getting rich with things from
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.240]   you.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.440]   I have not come to you for your things, but for yourself.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:17.080]   And this desire I now intensify and demonstrate by giving up things in the hope of enjoying
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.400]   you more, not things.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:26.440]   By giving to you what you do not need and what I might enjoy, I am saying more earnestly
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:33.400]   and more authentically, you are my treasure, not these things."
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:38.720]   And we should really look and reflect, what are we giving to God?
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:46.160]   Are we looking at him as if he's our treasure or the leftovers?
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.380]   We need to really think about that.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.840]   And this actually nicely brings us to our third point, which is we need to worship God
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.080]   for just who he is.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.960]   Now up to this point, when we looked at the entire story, there was nothing else, and
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:09.320]   I mean nothing else that these wise men wanted other than one thing, which is to worship
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.320]   God.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:15.680]   They did not go to him with a disease that they have, and they did not go trying to become
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   richer, and they did not go trying to get anything, but only to worship God.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:32.080]   Now I want to share with you about maybe two months ago, I was having lunch actually with
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.780]   Pastor Peter, and he was sharing with me about a testimony.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:42.580]   And it was about a young lady, she's about to graduate from school and she lives in Canada.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.380]   And so she was trying to get a job before she would graduate.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.980]   Many students do that to make sure that they secure a spot.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:55.860]   And so she applied and of course she got a job from the National Bank of Canada, which
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.220]   is a good job.
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:01.700]   And so she signed it, signed the offer and was ready for it.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:07.420]   And as she was still continuing the rest of her study, another offer came in, and it was
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.820]   from Morgan Stanley in the States.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:16.660]   So it was a great opportunity for her to explore and kind of just find out more about how it
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:22.720]   is to work at a more prestigious bank and to have that experience.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.880]   And so as I was listening, I kind of interrupted and I said, "Oh yeah, of course take the Morgan
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.060]   Stanley job because she hasn't started yet, right?
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.220]   This would be like great for a youngster, go for it."
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.100]   Of course, Pastor Peter did not say that.
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:40.140]   He was like, "Oh," and then I told her to stick with her original job.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.220]   I'm like, "Oh, okay."
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:50.280]   But the reason being is because he said as she had signed that offer, it was already
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:58.620]   some sort of agreement and she should try to honour that, try to honour that signature,
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.220]   try to honour it for God.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.940]   And I was, "Yeah, okay."
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:10.820]   And so as the story unfolds, when she first signed it, it was in 2019, okay?
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.460]   And then she was studying until the May of 2020.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.580]   And of course, as we all know, COVID hit.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:22.940]   And so all of her friends that have signed up to work in the States, everything was put
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.860]   to halt and they did not have a job.
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:30.460]   On the other hand, because she had honoured God and listened to Pastor Peter, I'm glad
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:38.420]   she did not ask me, you know, but maybe God would have given me something to give her.
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:43.660]   And so she had her job and everything was fine.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.540]   So listening to that, I was very motivated myself.
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:51.340]   I'm like, "Oh yeah, I got to go out there and then I got to do everything honouring
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.340]   God.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.220]   Oh yeah, I'm so ready for it."
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.820]   And so the next day, I was still ready for it the next day.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.580]   I still am.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:05.100]   And so the next day, I happened to have dinner with, well, I happen to have dinner with Philemon.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.300]   I mean, we have it all the time.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.700]   But we happened to go to Sky 100.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:16.940]   We're going to show this, yeah, which is on top of ICC, okay?
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.820]   So we're just enjoying ourselves and see Cafe 100.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.020]   And you know what we do kind of like tourists now, because we can't get out of Hong Kong,
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.020]   right?
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.500]   So we go to the souvenir store.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.480]   Ha ha, souvenir store.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:33.660]   So I was there and it was around like a Halloween time, okay?
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.860]   And you know, ladies, I'm not sure I can speak for all ladies, but just looking around for
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.860]   some good stuff.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.340]   And so looking at some Legos, you know, I like cute stuff.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:48.740]   And there was one where it was Cinderella with the theme of a Halloween.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.820]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.820]   That's what it looked like.
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.580]   And I was like, "Oh, this is so cute."
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.980]   But remembering the story or the testimony that Pastor Peter said, and I was like, "Okay,
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:04.800]   I should try to, you know, my best, give my very best to God, honor Him as much as I could."
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:11.320]   And so I felt like as a Christian, not to mention a pastor, buying a Halloween, like
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.260]   this, all right, might be a little bit too much.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.360]   So okay, I offer the second best.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.480]   It was something else.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.200]   Don't worry about that one.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   And so I'm like, "Okay, I'll get something."
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.880]   So feeling quite good about myself, you know, came honoring God.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:29.540]   And after we paid, you know, as I was just walking away and about to get to the cafe
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.200]   where we'll eat, you know, I have this thought.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:39.580]   I was like, "Did I worship God because of God alone?
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:46.800]   Or did I worship God because I was hoping for His protection or His blessing, just like
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.740]   that testimony I heard?"
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.340]   And I, you know, I struggled a little bit as I was walking away, and if I have to be
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:23:03.060]   very truthful, I have to say that I was worshiping God, but with the intent that maybe when I
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.560]   do it, something good will happen.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.680]   Maybe I'll be protected.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.280]   And I, you know, as I think, I'm like, "Okay, if the testimony had been different, if she
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:21.000]   gets signed on and calamity happened," and I was like, "Okay, maybe I won't be as motivated
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   to do it."
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.960]   And just that thought about the purity in our worship makes us or made me have another
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.440]   thought.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:41.340]   When I say I worship God, is there somewhere down deep inside of my heart somewhere that's
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:49.280]   actually wanting more from Him, some sort of blessing, some sort of protection?
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:54.520]   But look at these wise men.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:24:02.560]   They wanted nothing but Jesus to be in His presence to worship Him because He's the King,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:09.200]   He's the God, and He is our Savior who gave us Jesus and that He would die for us and
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.700]   wipe out our sins.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:16.840]   Is that not enough for us to worship Him, but to have other agendas?
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.440]   Now I'm not saying that we cannot pray for our needs, okay?
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:24.960]   I don't want us to stop asking God for things because He is our Heavenly Father and He even
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.280]   told us to ask for things.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:34.720]   It's okay to ask, but it's also a question that we need to think about in our heart.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:40.200]   Are we just doing certain things so we can kind of get some benefits?
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.560]   And if we are, we need to be very careful.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:49.640]   That kind of worship might not be as pure as we'd like to think.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:54.000]   And so it's very easy for us to find out, you know, which is like when we read our Bible
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.280]   or when we go to church or when we pray, when we think we're doing things that God likes,
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.120]   following His path, you know, do you have that sense that, okay, you know, I've done
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:10.120]   all these, I've been the good kid, not the Santa Claus, but you know, God will then look
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.880]   after me.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.760]   And you're like, well, how do I know if I do that?
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.320]   Well, just flip it over, okay?
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.600]   Just reverse it.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:22.160]   If something bad happened, do you think, oh, did I miss reading my Bible?
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.760]   Did I not pray?
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.120]   Did I cheat someone and hence this is happening?
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:33.160]   Because if you do, then maybe when you were doing those things, you were hoping to have
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.640]   some other benefits.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:42.600]   But let us be reminded by the wise man that when we worship Him, it's just because He
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:47.960]   is almighty God, because He's the creator, because He loves us, because He's ready to
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:53.080]   give everything that He has for us.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:26:03.800]   And there's no greater reason to worship and to praise Him other than just who He is.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:10.560]   And so I challenge all of you and for myself also, that when we look at the wise man, let
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:16.040]   us worship Him by prioritizing Him above everything.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:25.680]   Rather you have doubts, rather you're a very busy person, and just not worry about what
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.520]   other people think or say.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.640]   Just prioritize Him.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.160]   He is your priority.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.680]   Second thing is be prepared to give Him.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.600]   It's not about taking things from Him if you want to worship Him.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:46.960]   It's about giving with gladness, with thanksgiving, and with your gifts, things that are important
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.120]   to you.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:55.080]   And thirdly, really, let us worship Him for just who He is and nothing else.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:01.720]   Don't mix it in with a little bit of your own agenda, but entirely just for God, because
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.520]   He's worthy.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:12.580]   And so today just allow us to reexamine our heart and let our worship be from our hearts
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.680]   to Him, as pure as it can be.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.520]   Let us pray together.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.640]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for just who you are.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:31.920]   You're the God Almighty, the glorious one, and you're the one who loves us so much that
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   you gave us Jesus.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:42.440]   And Father, help us as we mature in our Christian walk, that Father, maybe before we went to
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:53.440]   you with problems and issues, but let us now go to you in your presence to worship you
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.320]   because of who you are.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.560]   Let us prioritize you.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.360]   And Father, help us in our weakness.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:06.880]   Help us during the times when we have our own desires and wishes.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.680]   Let us be fulfilled by you and you alone.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.120]   Help us have the right heart to worship you.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.560]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
