[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Good evening to everyone at home.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   It's been a strange, strange start to the Chinese New Year.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   I think my wife was just reflecting yesterday.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   It's nearly the middle of February already.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   What's happened to this year?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   What's going on?
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   But you know what?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   I'm still grateful, still grateful that we get to share the word of God.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   And hopefully, well, hopefully, first of all, that you are physically safe and physically healthy at home.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   We know that we've been hit with a whole new wave of cases recently.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   But on top of that, I hope that you feel spiritually fed, spiritually fed in the sense that even this, this isn't ideal.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   This isn't plan A, B or C.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   But hopefully, at least, it's still better than nothing.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   And that actually, even through the Internet, we can be a blessing to you.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   We can minister to you in some way.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And also, emotionally healthy.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   You know, it's, actually the title of today's message, I actually tweaked a little bit, and it's called "I am not".
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And I'll explain a bit more about what "I am not" means later.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   But it, you know, as we were just singing and just preparing, and what John shared, just made me think, you know what?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   It's also okay during a time like this to say, "I am not okay".
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   We're going through unprecedented times.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   This is the most cases we've had in the last two years.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   There's so much uncertainty.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   And I don't know about you, but I think I'll be the first to admit that actually, things have not been great.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Even just sometimes sitting back and just reflecting, "Man, I'm not sure I'm okay".
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And I don't know whether you guys have that or not, but I feel as though, if there's anyone out there, any of us who actually have that sentiment,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   "You know what? These last two years, or last three years for Hong Kong, have just been too much.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And we're not even allowed to get out. I am not okay".
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And I think if there's anything I want you to get out of this message, it's okay to say that, to say, "I am not okay".
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And then to reach out, maybe even now, maybe even as I'm speaking, maybe as I'm introducing this message, reach out to someone,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   go, "Hey, you know what? I know that we probably shouldn't meet face to face right now, but can we just talk on the phone for a little bit?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I just wanted to share. I don't think I'm fully there. I'm not okay".
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And I want that to just be a prompt for any of us who have that, "I am not".
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Because being emotionally healthy is so important.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And I feel as though this message, during this time, we, John, when you assigned this season to be talking about this,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   you had no idea that this was going to be what we were going to be facing.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And yet it's so important.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   We're still praying for, we're still dreaming for an emotionally healthy church.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And yet to get an emotionally healthy church, we must have emotionally healthy individuals.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So then the key is, are we as individuals emotionally healthy?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And as I was reflecting on the passage that I'm going to be preaching on today, the person in the Bible we're going to be looking at,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   the thing that really hit me about being emotionally healthy is that you need to have emotionally healthy expectations.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   You need to have good expectations of what, you know, we're all hoping for different things.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   We're hoping for COVID to go down. We're hoping for schools to open back up.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   We're hoping that we can go out and meet our families and friends.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And we're hoping that we can get to fly out of Hong Kong, at least for a little bit.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Of course, right now, those may not be healthy expectations, given the situation that we have.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   But to have healthy expectations is the beginning to being emotionally healthy.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And in order to have emotionally healthy expectations, we actually need to have a healthy perception of ourselves.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   How many of us can say that we have that? That we have an emotionally healthy perception of ourselves?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   We know who we are. We know our own identity. We know our own purpose.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   More importantly, we know our own limits. We know what we can't control.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   We know the things that actually are completely out of our control that we have to surrender.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   You see, we need to recognise those, because when we recognise those, when we know our identity, our person, our limits,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   then we have healthy expectations. And when we have healthy expectations, that's when we start to become emotionally healthy as individuals.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And then when we become emotionally healthy as individuals, then we as a church body have the chance to be emotionally healthy.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   To have an accurate perception of self is maybe where it starts.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Now that really is called, we know what that word is, it's actually humility.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   The word there is actually humility. Someone has once said that pride is basically taking credit for something that you don't deserve.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Having an over-inflated or even an under-inflated view of yourself is what pride is.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It's not knowing who you are. But knowing, when you know your true worth, then you are humble.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   But the problem is this. Humility is so, so hard to grasp. So hard to get.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   There's another quote that I love is, "Humility is such a rare trait that once you think you grasp it, you've lost it."
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Humility is such a rare trait that once you think you've grasped it, that's the moment that you've lost it.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Of course we've all heard the very popular quote, "Humility is not thinking any less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less."
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And to start to think about how we can become emotionally healthy, I think it actually, the road begins with humility.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   It begins with us looking at ourselves, but also then recognising it's not about ourselves.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   But we're currently surrounded by a society that is, I guess you could even say narcissistic in the way we approach things.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Everything, everything is about us. Everything is about what we can do, how we can thrive, how we can strive for the next level for us.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And yet what we see is we're surrounded by brokenness. We're surrounded by just people just hurting and in pain.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Certainly a couple of days ago we heard about the former Miss USA, who became a lawyer, who took her own life at the age of 30.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And this was an individual who was perceived to have everything, and yet at 30 she felt that there was no more hope, there was no more purpose to live.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And then she gave it all up.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   At the very least that tells you this pursuit of just satisfying your own CV, of building it up, of puffing it up, of focusing on yourself, isn't actually enough.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It doesn't give you the joy that you're looking for.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   You Too has a song, "You've still not found what you're searching for."
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And so where do we get that true joy from? Where do we get that ultimate satisfaction from?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   It's ultimately when we look beyond ourselves.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And as we look beyond ourselves, we're going to look into the Bible, and we're going to look into the book of John.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And there's a character I want to talk to you about who shows immense humility.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And it's not someone that you actually think first would be the person you'd use to talk about humility.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And that is John the Baptist.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   John the Baptist is someone who is actually emotionally healthy and also a true display of humility.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Why, you ask?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Because John the Baptist, from the account we see in Scripture, was a pretty crazy man.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   He spent most of his time in the wilderness.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   He used camel's hair as a jacket.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   He ate locusts and wild honey.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And he went around shouting at people.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And you're like, "Oh, well, he's entitled to do what he wants to, but I wouldn't call him humble."
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And yet, actually, despite all the things that he shouted out, all the things that he said,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   you know what his life's cry is, if I was to sum up, if I dared to even try to sum up what John the Baptist's life was about?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It would be in one sentence, and it's this.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   It's not about me. It's about him.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   He would write on his grave, as I hazard a guess, would be, "It wasn't about me. It's all about him."
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And as I was reflecting on his story, I was like, "Those are the only words that came to my mind.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It's not about us. It's about him."
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And so today, I want to talk about, I want to unpack what he says.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I want to look at how it's humble and how it will help us become emotionally healthy.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And really, the key, the landing point of all of this, the one sentence I want you ringing in your minds as you leave is,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   "It's not about me. It's about him."
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   But before I jump into that, I recognize there's two people who are listening.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   There's two types of people who are listening, whether online or whether here.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And the first type is this.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   You don't truly know your worth in Jesus yet.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Maybe you're not a believer yet.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Maybe you haven't committed your life to him.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Maybe you're not in a relationship with him.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   And to you, I want to say, you are of ultimate worth.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   You are of so much worth.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   You are loved so dearly.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   You are fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   So much worth that Jesus, the Son of God, the Prince of Heaven, deemed you worthy enough to sacrifice himself for you.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And I want you to know that, that you are that valuable.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   You may have spent your life being neglected.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   You may have spent your life not being seen or not being respected or heard.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I want you to know how valuable you are in the eyes of God and how much he loves you.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   You're the first group.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   The second group of people is those of us who actually know God, know Jesus, know that we're Christians.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   And to you, I want to say something else.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   To others, I want to say something else, and that's this.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   It's not about you.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   It's all about God.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   You see, so often, even in our own Christian lives, we've made it about us.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   God, what do you want me to do?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   What's the thing that you want me to carry out for you?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   How am I going to find satisfaction?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   God, you give me peace.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   It's all about me.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   And I want to tell you, beloved brothers and sisters, it's not about you.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   It's about him.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's not about me.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   It's about him.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And in order for us to take on that journey, we have to figure out, to get to that point
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   where we recognise it's not about us, we have to do three things.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   We have to know our own identity, we have to know our own limits, and we have to know our own purpose.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Just like John the Baptist.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And next slide will show, as we look at John the Baptist, why was he humble?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   It was because he knew his own identity.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   He knew his own limits, and he knew his own purpose.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   That's why the title of the sermon is "I Am Not."
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And today we'll just jump straight in and we'll unpack these three points, and I hope the message that carries through is,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   it's not about us.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It's not about our own goals and our own ambitions.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   You can take everything else, just give me the one that truly matters.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Jesus.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And so we jump straight in.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   John the Baptist knows his own identity.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   John chapter 1, verse 19, and it says this.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   "And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him,"
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   three words, "Who are you?"
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   A little bit of context here.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   John the Baptist is growing a bit of a fan base.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   He's getting quite popular.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   He may be crazy, but people are following him.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And they're going out into the wilderness to find him, to be shouted at, and to repent, and to be baptised.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   So he's getting a following.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   So at that point, the Jews, the Pharisees, they're like, "Well, who is this guy?"
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Now, they're used to this because they feel their mission is to basically clump out and exterminate any false messiahs.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   So they send these priests and these Levites to go out to him, and they ask him three words, "Who are you?"
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   And John the Baptist looks at them, knowing what they're really asking.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Because what they're really asking is, "Wait, are you a prophet?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Are you a messiah?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Who are you?"
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Really, they're asking two things.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   "Who are you, and what is your business here?"
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   "Mai masui a?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Nei ma gau ma la?"
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Is what they're asking.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Because they're seeing this following, and they're like, "This is threatening to us."
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And then, he doesn't tell them who he is.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And he says, it's not on the slides, he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   So instead of saying who he is, which he could say, "Hey, I am John, son of Elizabeth, son of Zechariah.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   I am a Baptist by trade.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   I'm a bit of a crazy man.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I prefer camel's hair on my skin."
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   He doesn't say any of those things.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   He goes straight into the heart of why they're asking.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And he says, "I am not the Christ."
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And then they go, "Well, okay, if you're not the Christ, then who are you?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Are you a prophet? Are you Elijah?"
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   He's like, "No, no, no, no, I am not any of those things."
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And then what does he say?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   He says, in verse 23, he said, "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Make straight the way of the Lord," as the prophet Isaiah said.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   So he roots his answer of who he is in Scripture.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   He didn't tell them anything else, but he says, "Who I am can be found in the word of God, and this is who I am.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I am the voice.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I am just the voice of one crying out in the desert.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Make straight the way of the Lord."
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   So his answer is all about rooted identity in Scripture.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   I wonder if someone asked us, "Who are you?"
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Maybe recently someone has asked you, "Oh, who are you?"
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   How would you respond?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   So often in society right now, when we're asked that question, depending on context, we'll be like,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   "Well, I am James, son of Nelson. I'm a pastor. I do this, I do that. I'm Chinese. I like Chinese food."
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   And then you tell them all the things about you.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   But here's the thing. If we don't know our true identity, that's when we'll start to lose our way.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   That's when we'll lose our humility because we'll either become too prideful or too insecure.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   And then when we do that, we're heading towards emotional unhealthiness.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   But the question is, when you are asked, "Who are you?"
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   What is the first thing that you say?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Your social media profile, your Instagram account.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Because you're asked to put your name and then you're asked to give a little bio of yourself.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   What do you write there?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   What is the first thing that you write there?
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   What do you do?
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   In our circles, it's probably my name and what I do.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   But what's your prime identity?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Because identity is so important.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   And John here seems to get it right.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   He knows exactly who he is. He roots his answer in Scripture.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   For us, who are we?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   See, identity is so important.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Even the world outside who don't know God know how important it is.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   So many films, so many heroes in the film.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Of course, films have to kind of go up and down and there's valleys and before the final triumph.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   How do they get to that final triumph?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Often that hero discovers who they truly are.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   You hear Simba hearing the voice booming from the heavens, "Remember who you are."
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   When we know our identity, that is when we are truly humble.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   That's when we'll finally be on the road to becoming emotionally healthy.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   So my question to all of us here, to my question to you at home.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   When you are asked, "Who are you?" What do you say?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   You see, in Hong Kong, HKID cards are very important.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And they're so important that if you found not having, carrying it, then of course you get punished.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   But I think for us, as children of God, we've dropped our identity cards half the time.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   We can't find where they are.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Because I'll tell you who you really are.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   You are a child of God.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   You are a child of God.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Now just pause for a second because you've heard that, you've sang it before.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   And I want you to imagine, if that was the thing on your mind the most when you think about identity,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   how would that, how should that impact the way you live?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Those people that you're slightly intimidated by, those people you're slightly jealous of,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   that person you're particularly angry at,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   how does your identity as a child of God impact the way you think about them now?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   That career move that you really want to make,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   that car that you really want to buy,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   that lifestyle that you really want to live.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   If you truly recognise that you are not so and so, and a doctor, or an engineer, or whatever it may be,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   if you are truly, I am so and so, I am a child of the most high God,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   how does that impact the way you think?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   How does that impact the way you live?
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Because that has so much to do with whether you'll end up being emotionally healthy or being unhealthy.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   So John the Baptist knows his own identity, and then he knows his own limits.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Chapter 1, verse 26 says this.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   So they ask him, "Hey, wait, you're not the Christ, you're not Elijah, you're not the prophet,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   so what are you doing? Why are you baptising people?"
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   That's what they're asking him, and then verse 26 they say this,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   "And John answered them, 'I baptise with water, but among you stands one you do not know.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.'"
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   So not only does he know his own identity, he also knows his own limits.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   He knows his own limits, and it's so important, if we're to be emotionally healthy, to know our own limits.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   He knows who he is not.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   How often do we know who we are not?
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   How often do we know what our own limits are?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Yet society tells us to keep striving, keep chasing, keep going, because there's a better you in there.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And yet we find there's nothing.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   But if we were to know our own limits, John says, "I baptise with water,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   but there's going to be someone who's coming who's going to baptise you with the Spirit."
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Let me tell you about this guy.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   This guy, I'm not even worthy to untie his sandals.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Just let me tell you a little bit about that.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Back then, disciples obviously would care for rabbis.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   They'd give them drinks, they'd look after them, give them food, give them a jacket to wear if they're cold.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   But there's one thing that they wouldn't do, would be to untie their sandals,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   because that job was exclusive to slaves.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   So then someone like John is saying, he's like, "I am not even worthy to be a slave for the next guy."
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   He knows his own limits. He's like, "I'm only dealing with water here.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   The elements I'm dealing with are physical and from this realm,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   but this guy is going to be baptising with the Spirit.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   And with him, I cannot even compare.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   I know my own limits."
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   And that water baptism is simply just a symbol for the baptism that is to come.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   And so he's saying, "Look, you don't even know."
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Here's the problem. These people asking him questions,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   they are still looking for the Messiah, but they're also trying to clamp down all the false messiahs.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Isn't it ironic that in the midst there, in their midst was the actual Messiah,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   yet they couldn't see him. Why?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Because they were prideful. Because they had a religious pride in them.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   They were too busy puffing themselves up. They were blind.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And yet here's John the Baptist saying, "I know my own limits.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Look, I know who I am not. I'm not even pretending to be a big deal.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Because there's a guy who's coming who I'm not even qualified to be his slave.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   I can't even be his slave.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   So don't come at me with this because there's going to be someone who's even bigger."
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   John the Baptist knows his own limits.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   It's interesting here because Jesus himself says, Luke 7, he says,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   "There's none greater than John the Baptist."
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   John the Baptist is the greatest. Jesus himself said that.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   And so if the greatest that Jesus said still knows his own limits,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   still thinks he is nothing compared to Jesus, where does that leave us?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   But do we truly know our own limits? Do we have that kind of pride?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Because if we have that kind of pride, then we have to repent of it.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   We have to let it go. Because we're nothing compared to even John the Baptist,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   let alone Jesus. The road to emotional health starts with humility.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   The road to humility starts with knowing your own identity, knowing your own limits,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   knowing who you are not.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And again, there's two types of people here I need to address this with
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   when it comes to this issue of knowing your own limits.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   There's a group who you can't stop puffing yourselves up.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   You can't stop pretending to be someone that you're not.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   You can't stop saying, "Hey, look, I can do all these things.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Look at me. I can do all these different things."
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   To you, it's let go. Know your own limits.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And if anything, these last few years around the world have reminded us
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   that we are all flawed. We all fall short of the glory of God.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Know your own limits. Know who you are not.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Be comfortable in saying, "I am not good at this.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   I do not know what is going on. I am not okay."
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Stop puffing yourself up.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And to the second group, you're beating yourself up.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   And I want you to tell you to stop beating yourself up.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   You are limited. You are flawed. You are mortal.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   And that's okay.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   But your insecurity is actually a form of pride in itself.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Your insecurity isn't humility.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Because it's showing that you don't know your own identity.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   You don't know your own limits.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   If you were truly aware and knew what your limits are,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   you would recognise that, man, Jesus doesn't care about what you can do.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   There isn't a ladder to climb up to Jesus.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   There's nothing that you can jump for and grasp to get to Jesus.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   The only way you get to Jesus is to know your own limits
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   and to open your hands out.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Know your identity. Know your limits.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   So how does John know his own limits?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   How does he remind himself every day of this?
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Because we've all been there where there'll be days where we're like,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   "You know what? I was too prideful at that moment. I was too insecure."
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I remind myself of it.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   But then it's still tiring to do it every day, right?
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   We always forget and we always end up back in the same place.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   How did John do it?
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   How did John maintain that level of humility?
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   It's in a little bit later, and I don't think it's on the slides here.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Verse 29, it says, "The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   and he said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.'"
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   You see, I think this gives us a clue as to how John the Baptist remained humble.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   His eyes were focused on Jesus.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   When he walked into a place where he saw Jesus,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   instead of saying, "Behold, I, John the Baptist,"
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God."
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   His eyes were constantly focused on Jesus.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   See, the way we battle pride, the way we battle insecurity,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   is genuinely to think of ourselves less.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Whichever way you're coming from,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   is to know your own identity, to know your own limits,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   and to let go and stop saying, "Behold, I, look at me,"
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   or, "Don't look at me."
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   No, let both of those sides go.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Just behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   When we commit, devote to simply keeping our eyes turned to Jesus,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   then we will be free from the pride.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Then we will be free from the insecurity.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Then we will know our own identity.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Then we will know our own limits.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   So whether you are puffing yourself up or beating yourself up,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   the goal is to let go and to behold and look at Jesus.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   So the first thing, know your own identity.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   The second thing, know your own limits.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   The final thing, know your purpose.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   We see in chapter one again, verse 23, he says,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   "make straight the way of the Lord."
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   He roots his answer in scripture.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Verse 31, he says, "I myself did not know him,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   "but for this purpose I came, for this purpose I came,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   "baptising with water that he might be revealed to Israel."
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   See, if we are to become emotionally healthy,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   not only do we need to know who we are,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   but not only do we need to know what our limits are,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   we also need to know why we are here.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   So that question that the Jews asked John,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   "Who are you and what's your business here?"
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   That is the same question that the world is asking us.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Who are you and what are you doing here?
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And so for us, we need to know the answer to that.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   We need to know what we were called for.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And John himself said, "I am the voice of the one crying out in the wilderness,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   "making straight the way of the Lord."
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   You see, back then, ancient royalty, whenever they went to visit a town,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   they would actually send someone ahead of them
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   to make straight the path, to basically get rid of any obstacles.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   If there was a wild ox just blocking the path,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   it was that person's job to get rid of it before the royalty comes.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   And what John is saying here, "Hey, if this is what I'm here to do,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   "Jesus is on his way, the Messiah is on his way.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   "My job is to make sure his road is clear."
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Where's the Messiah heading?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   The Messiah is heading into our hearts.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   It is heading into your heart, my heart.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   What is John's role, as he sees here?
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   John is saying, "In order for the Messiah to head into your heart,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   "I need to tell you about him and so you repent."
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   The preparation for this Messiah is repentance.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   And he's saying, "I'm here just to prepare that
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   "so that Jesus can be the one that walks straight into your heart, not me."
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Jesus, "Not me, because I'm not even allowed to be his slave.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   "I'm not even good enough to be his slave."
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   But it's Jesus.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   And so for us, we also need to know our purpose.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   How do we know our purpose?
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Isn't that the question of the day?
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   What am I here for?
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   I mean, one of the best-selling books, Christian books of all time,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   is "Purpose Driven Life."
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   And so we're looking for that purpose, right?
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   We're looking, "Why, God, did you make me?"
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   But then maybe the question isn't a wrong question,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   but maybe the angle that we're approaching it is wrong.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   When we're looking to God and going, "Why did you make me?"
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   What are we really making it about?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   We're actually still making it about us.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   "Great Almighty God, King of the heavens, why did you make me?"
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   As if it's all about us.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   But in order for us to truly know our purpose,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   maybe we twist it around a little bit.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   In order to find out what we are created for,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   our goal may simply be to find out the Creator.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   If a creation wants to find out what it's created for,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   then know the Creator.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   And there only really is one purpose and one call.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Psalm 27 says this, "There's only one thing I'm after."
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   What's the one thing I'm after?
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   To dwell in God's presence.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   To gaze upon His beauty, to inquire in His temple, to glorify Him.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   That's the main calling.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   It's almost the only calling.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   All the other callings are simply expressions of that one.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   To know Him and be known, to love Him and be loved.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   And we need to stop making it about us.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   We need to stop making it about,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   "My purpose is still for me to find satisfaction."
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Even a righteous one that sounds spiritual and sound holy,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   but it's still about me.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   And I wonder whether there are any of us like that.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   I search my heart as I'm asking God, "What do you want me to do?"
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   So often I realize, God just turning back to me,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   "James, it's cute that you ask that, but it's not really about you.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   It's about me.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   It's about how big I am, not what you can do.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   It's about what I've done, not what you're about to do.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   But it's cute that you ask it."
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   But I wonder, even for those of us who are well-meaning,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   are we committed to knowing the Creator Himself,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   recognizing that He's the end goal, He's the destination,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   rather than going to Him just to find out what we were made for?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Sometimes we feel as though He's sitting on a desk somewhere
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and we're just all queuing up, waiting to see Him,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   just for Him to give us a piece of paper to tell us what we're supposed to do.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   But no, that's not the purpose, that's not the goal.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   The goal is simply to behold Him, to know who He is.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   And in that, we will find our purpose.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   So we need to know our own identity, we need to know our own limits,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   and we need to know our purpose, the ultimate purpose
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   of being loved by Him and to love others.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   That is the key here.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   And that is how, really, an aspect of how we achieve humility.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And I want to finish with this, and again, it's later on in Chapter 3,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   there's another passage that, in these four verses,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   it sums up everything about John in these four verses.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   And I want to finish with that because it hammers home
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   all of the aspects that we've just been looking at.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   In Chapter 3, verse 27, and actually just before that,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   what's happening is John's disciples are having a discussion
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   with other people about a ritual, about purification,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   and they're having a little argument.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   And then they go to John, their rabbi, and say,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   "Rabbi, you know that guy from the other day?"
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Brackets, Jesus, the Messiah, the Lamb of God.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   "He's baptising a whole ton of people, and people are going to him.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Do you recognise that our stall is now getting quieter and quieter?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   The forecast does not look good for our business.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   It's not going the way that we want it to if we're trying to promote ourselves.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   What do you want us to do?"
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   is basically what they're asking, because they still don't get it.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   They've put their lives following John,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   and they're hoping that this reaps success.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Their investment will end up multiplying,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   and they'll gain in at least significance.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   What they're seeing is everyone's going over there, to that guy,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   and he's not even wearing camel's hair.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   And so they turn to him and ask him this question,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   and what does he say?
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Verse 27, he replies, and he says,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   "A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven."
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   And he's saying, "Do you not realise that everything I have,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   everything that we're even doing here, comes from him?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   That he's the main attraction here?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   Do you not realise that?"
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   You see, when we realise that everything that we have comes from him,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   then you know what that does?
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   That stops us from envying.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   That stops us from being jealous, because we're like,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   "Whoa, we had nothing to begin with, and yet God's given us this,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   so we don't need to look anywhere else, let alone to the Saviour of the world."
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   John, again, knew who he was, and knew who he's not,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   and knew what he was here for.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Do you not understand that everything we have is because of him?
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   The fact that you even have life, oxygen, a brain,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   to be able to say these words to me, comes from him.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   So humble yourself, let go.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   It's not about us, it's about him.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   And then he carries on, he says, verse 28, he says,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   "You yourselves bear witness that I said, 'I am not the Christ,'
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   but I've been sent before him."
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   He's like, "You were there when I said the other day
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   that I am not the Christ, so you shouldn't be following me
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   because you think I'm the Christ, or a prophet, or Elijah.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   You know who I am, I'm simply a voice.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   I'm not even allowed to assign myself a body,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   I'm not even that important, I'm just a voice crying out in the wilderness,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   'Make straight the way of the Lord.'"
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Realise who I am, and who I am not.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   No trace of envy, no trace of bitterness.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   He's embraced a descent into being anonymous,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   and he's completely okay with it.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   This courageous, loud, brash guy is ready to be known by no one.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   That is humility.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   And then he carries on, verse 29,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   "The one who has the bride is the bridegroom.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   The friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Therefore, this joy of mine is now complete."
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   He's saying, "Look, if it's a wedding,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   I need you to know that I'm not the groom.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   I am actually simply a friend of the groom.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Maybe best man, I don't know, I don't care.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   But I'm just a friend of the groom,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   and filled with happiness looking at this."
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   A couple of months ago, I was at the honour and excitement
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   of witnessing my own brother's wedding.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   And I remember the joy that I felt from, well,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   actually seeing him get married,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   because I never thought it would happen.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And then, you know what, I remember just standing there,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   the pride I felt, the joy I felt,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   of just looking at him going, "Oh, we've made it.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   He's finally made it."
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   And I remember that joy.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   I think back to my own wedding some 11 and a half years ago.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   I remember him standing there,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   and we had another friend standing there.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   I remember the smile on their faces when I was getting married.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   There's something about when it's not about you,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   where you naturally smile.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Whereas the wedding couple themselves,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   sometimes they're just forced to smile for the whole day,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   because they're supposed to.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   But when it's not about you, you're always free,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   and I'm just like, "Oh, that is so amazing that this is happening,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   when it's not about you."
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And actually, what's even more special about that wedding
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   a couple of months ago, was that it wasn't even about them.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   And that was the joy that came from it,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   was that it was about God.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   The whole wedding was pointing to God.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   It was two people in love, and actually often,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   the name Bridezilla comes from somewhere,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   and I won't say anymore,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   is couples getting married make the wedding all about themselves.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   And then it becomes a very stressful event for all those involved,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   especially the pastors trying to help them.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   And yet when you let go and just realise,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   "Oh my goodness, it's not even about me."
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   This wedding is simply just to reflect
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   the biggest wedding that is to come.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   The details of this banquet are nothing compared
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   to what is going to be coming in the future.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Then suddenly that burden is lifted off your shoulders.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Suddenly, you're able to find that joy.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   That joy that you can't find whilst being a narcissist.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Because, see it's interesting,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   the Kingdom of God is so subtle and so gentle and so gracious,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   it's that it hides these things in plain sight.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   And you're only able to attain them,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   only able to achieve them, when you let go.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   When you realise it's not about you, it's about Him.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And that moment, John the Baptist realises,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   and then he says, "As the friend of the bridegroom,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   "the groom is now here, and I am rejoicing greatly,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   "therefore this joy of mine is now complete."
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Isn't that what we all want?
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   That we get to say, "Our joy is complete."
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Isn't that it?
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Isn't that what we're all searching for?
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   That true satisfaction from within.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   And being able to say, "It is complete."
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Where did that joy start from for John the Baptist?
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   He started that when he was still in the womb.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Remember when Mary goes to visit Elizabeth,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   and then suddenly John jumps in the womb out of joy?
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   So even from before he was born,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   he knew his life, his identity, his limits,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   his purpose was to point to the Messiah,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   and finally the Messiah is now here.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   And because of that, his joy is complete.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   And the final words, "He must increase, I must decrease.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   "He must become greater, I must become less."
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   When you realise who you are, when you realise who you're not,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   you realise you can find true joy,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   and at that moment you no longer have to strive for things
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   the way the people in this world do.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   You can let go, and then you can find that true joy.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   But that's a rare trait to have,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   to genuinely be able to say, "He must increase, I must decrease."
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   If only us pastors, if only bankers, if only doctors,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   if only all of us would commit to saying that together.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   It's not about us, it's about Him.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   There's going to come a day when Jesus returns.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Our job is to make straight the way of the Lord,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   to lead people to Him, to show them how much they are loved,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   to be His hands and feet, recognising the head is coming back.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And in that, we will find joy, and in that, they will find joy.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   That impacts the way you live, if you truly understand that.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Instead of walking into a setting, a gathering,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   which we're doing less and less of these days,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   and saying, "Behold, I, James, have arrived."
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Or instead of thinking, "Do I want to be here even at this?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   "Do I even want to be here at this gathering?
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   "Do I even want to see these people?
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   "Do I even want to do this?"
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   The question then ends up flipping, once we get the right mindset.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   It becomes, not whether I want to be here, is God here?
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Because if God's here, then I want to be here.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Because it's not about me, it's about Him.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   And when we do that, when we find that true humility,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   that is when we're on the road to being emotionally healthy.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   When we do that as a body, together.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Can you imagine all of us doing that?
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Laying aside our own preferences for human beings,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   laying aside our own preferences for friends,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   and for social gatherings, for jobs even,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   for anything that we do in this world.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   If all of us, as a body of Christ, all laid down and saying,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   "It's not about us, it's about Him."
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Wouldn't that change the way of the world?
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Wouldn't that turn the world upside down?
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   And isn't that what we are called to do?
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   How attractive would we be as a body of Christ?
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   How beautiful a bride would we be,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   if we were all able to have that kind of mindset?
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   And that is what we commit to doing.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Saying, being that body that cries out,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   "It's not about us, it's not about me, it's about Him."
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   All of it is about Him.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   From the beginning to the end, it's about Him.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   May that be our heart's cry,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   especially as we navigate these times in this city.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Let's pray.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   So Lord, we thank you again for this reminder
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   that it is all about you.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   That everything that we have and everything that we are
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   all comes from you.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Lord, you are the cornerstone.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   We are simply just the earth's stones lying around,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   but we'll only find out who we are in reference to you.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   So I pray, Lord.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   I pray for the emotional health of our church.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   I pray for the emotional health of each member of this church.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Lord, that we would start on that road to being emotionally healthy
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   through humbling ourselves.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Would you be gracious to us and let us understand what true humility is?
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Would you show us where we dropped our identity cards?
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Would you remind us who we are?
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   And then Lord, would you also remind us of our limits,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   how we fall short?
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   But recognising that's okay,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   because your power is made perfect in our weaknesses.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   And Lord, then as we come face to face with you, our creator,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   can you tell us what you have created us for?
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   But not for our own fulfilment, not for our own satisfaction,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   but for you, Lord.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Everything, everything is about you.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   You must become greater.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   We must become less.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   You must increase.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   We must decrease.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   It's not about us.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   It's all about you.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   We thank you that that is the truth that we can hold on to today.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   In your name we pray.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Amen.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.060]   you
