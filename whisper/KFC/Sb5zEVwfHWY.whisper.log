[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.960]   All right, so for the last few weeks,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.600]   we've gone through 1 Timothy, the first five chapters.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.260]   So if you haven't been with us, it's okay,
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.400]   it's still online, you can go back to it.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.280]   So we've been talking about a few things.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.760]   I don't know if you remember, let's see.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.160]   What have, remember we've been upholding the truth,
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.640]   and then what else?
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.920]   To pray, to serve, to lead,
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.880]   and lastly, we also have to love.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.440]   And this week we have one,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.400]   it's the final charge from Apostle Paul to Timothy,
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.220]   it is to fight.
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.880]   I mean, what are we fighting for?
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.560]   And I love how all the songs today really led us into that.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.480]   It is fighting the good fight of faith.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.040]   Now we probably have heard of it every now and then,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.320]   this saying, fight the good fight of faith.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.840]   But what is it, what does that really look like?
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.560]   So we're gonna go through that today,
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.840]   1 Timothy, chapter six.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.560]   Now speaking of fighting, I mean,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.840]   the most recent movie I saw on fighting was Shang-Chi.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.000]   So we're gonna show that, put that up.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.740]   How many, how many of you have seen that movie?
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.520]   All right, good, good, good, quite a number of you,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.320]   so I won't be spoiling it for everybody,
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.720]   I'll just spoil it for a few.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.080]   And I mean, during, one of the WhatsApps we have seen
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.980]   is that a few of our people commented
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.900]   that one of our pastors
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.920]   looked kind of like the protagonist here.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.680]   And so we got our, oh, there we go.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.800]   I mean, we, yeah, a few of you took a few photos, so.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.080]   We got our IT team together,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.000]   which is like just Bonnie, by the way, to help us do this.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.920]   And we also have a Tony Leung here,
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.480]   which is one of our deacons, you know, Tony.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.840]   But, you know, I thought I wanna keep my job,
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.700]   so we won't put him on.
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.620]   So I mean, when we talk about fighting, right,
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.720]   these are the kind of things we're thinking about fighting.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.920]   Fist, but actually from this story,
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.440]   oh, too early, too early, let's not show that yet.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.940]   So from this, from this story, right,
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.200]   we wanna keep Johnny on for as long as possible.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.280]   So from this story, actually, we see that Tony Leung
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.080]   actually gains these 10 rings,
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.680]   if you know what I'm talking about,
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.160]   and he gains this super power,
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.240]   and he almost becomes immortal 'cause he doesn't die.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.340]   But the more power he got, the more he desired for it.
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.260]   Until a point when he met his wife,
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.420]   that's when he turned into the good guy,
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.220]   'cause he put down his rings, he's like,
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.900]   all right, I'm all for family.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.180]   But then, of course, as the plot goes,
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.540]   his wife is then murdered, and once he's just full of rage,
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.380]   he puts these 10 rings back on,
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.660]   and he's ready for evil for evil, right?
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.980]   And so he has his son, Shang-Chi, now played by Johnny,
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.960]   but he's way too happy for this role.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.440]   But I mean, if he were ever to go
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.060]   for a Hollywood star position, he would do well.
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.060]   So what we find is that he actually trains Shang-Chi,
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.300]   this Tony Leung, trains him to be an assassin.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.980]   And so what we find is Shang-Chi says,
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.920]   no, and I'm gonna flee away from this.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.120]   This kind of evilness is not what I want.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.420]   He flees away from it, and he goes and pursues his life.
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.900]   That's a very different life, his own dreams.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.820]   But eventually, of course, his dad finds him,
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.340]   and they have this big battle,
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.920]   and then he takes hold of what's really important to him.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.220]   Now, what does this have to do with 1 Timothy 6?
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.620]   There is a lot to it, because we realize fighting
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.900]   is not just with our fists, but then there's three points
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.780]   that we can really learn from.
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.740]   And first, we see that it really is
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.060]   to flee away from what's bad.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.460]   Okay, we can go to, yes.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.900]   Flee away from what is bad, and then pursue what is good.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.820]   And we're gonna go through what is bad, what is good.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.620]   And that's to take hold of what is important.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.820]   So let's go to 1 Timothy 6, verse 11 and 12, it says,
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.360]   "But you, man of God," this is Apostle Paul
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.620]   speaking to Timothy, "Flee from all this,"
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.620]   which we'll talk about, "and pursue righteousness,
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.660]   "goodness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.900]   "Fight the good fight of faith.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.580]   "Take hold of eternal life to which you were called."
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.900]   Now, all of these words, we're kind of like,
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.240]   okay, we get it, but so what are we doing?
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.700]   And basically, let's start with flee.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.100]   Okay, flee from what?
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.340]   Now, if we look from the previous verses in a moment,
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.860]   we're gonna see it's talking about flee
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.980]   from the false teaching and love of money.
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.260]   Now, Paul's been going through some sort of false teaching,
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.520]   but every chapter has been slightly different.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.420]   So what kind of false teaching is he talking about here?
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.480]   Now, if we read from verse three, it says,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.200]   "If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.600]   "to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.200]   "and the godly teaching,
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.500]   "they're conceited and understand nothing."
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.980]   So we know, okay, there are these false teachers,
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.280]   they don't really understand, they're against Jesus, okay.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.580]   So the next verse says, "They have an unhealthy interest
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.820]   "in controversies and quarrels about words
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.920]   "that result in envy, strive, malicious talk,
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.800]   "evil suspicions, and constant friction
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.980]   "between people of corrupt mind
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.200]   "who have been robbed of the truth
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   "and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain."
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.240]   So you see, these false teacher we're mentioning here,
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.500]   they're against God's doctrine.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.620]   Again, we're not quite sure what they are,
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.220]   but if we read between the lines,
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.320]   we really see that there are these descriptions, okay.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.320]   So they have unhealthy interests,
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.200]   and then we see five things that are listed here.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.900]   Envy, strive, malicious talk,
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.040]   evil suspicion, and constant friction.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.960]   Now, if you look at this list, okay,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.640]   what is it that this list have in common,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.480]   other than unhealthy interests, which already says,
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.720]   what do they have in common?
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   I mean, why would anybody want these?
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.920]   I mean, who wants these?
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.760]   Why, what do they have in common?
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.200]   Well, you see, all of these things
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.360]   are talking about one thing, which is about me.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.760]   Not me, but about the self.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.580]   Every one of these items is talking about for yourself.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.760]   I mean, envy, I mean, why would you envy someone?
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.280]   Well, because whatever it is that they have,
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.940]   you also want, right?
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.080]   Strive, you wanna like cause rivalry, because why?
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.160]   You wanna say, I'm better than you.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.760]   So I'm gonna prove that I'm right and you're wrong.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.020]   And malicious talk, why do you wanna talk badly of others?
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.640]   Well, you wanna judge them, you wanna say you're better.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.160]   So it's like self lifting, you're lifting yourself up.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.120]   And by saying these evil suspicions,
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.880]   like you're saying they have these evil intentions.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.880]   When all of us, all along, you're the one that has it,
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.720]   not you, but I mean, the people, the false teacher,
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.160]   all the ones that have it.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.480]   And they constantly will fight and argue with other people,
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.300]   just for one thing, which is to lift themselves up,
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.080]   put others down, and everything, if we read it,
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.760]   is actually to a point where they're robbed of the truth
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.760]   and think that godliness is a means to financial gains.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.440]   So sometimes these people have gone so far
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.040]   that they've lost what is most important.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.920]   You see, the difference between sound teaching
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.840]   and false teaching is that it's all about you
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.000]   and your own benefits rather than other people.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.200]   And they're using money in the wrong way.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.080]   Now, one of the examples we probably have heard before
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.440]   is that there might be preachers and leaders
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.680]   who misuse money in a way that is so bad
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.580]   it's for their own interests.
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.440]   Now, one of them, I'm gonna use today an example,
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.680]   which is Kong He, he is the founder
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.520]   of City Harvest Church in Singapore.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.600]   And he was convicted of fraud
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   after spending millions of Thai
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.640]   to fund his wife's music career.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.560]   And this is a classic example of where sometimes
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.560]   our heart can be so torn or so dragged into other desires
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.920]   that we actually lose the focus of what's important.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.640]   And so that's why in verse six to 10, it says,
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.200]   "But godliness with contentment is great.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.360]   For we brought nothing into the world
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.800]   and we can take nothing out of it.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.520]   But if we have food and clothing, we'll be content."
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.700]   You know, there's something about contentment
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.600]   that gives us a great gain.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.560]   Now, we're quite sure that Apostle Paul
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.400]   is probably not talking about monetary gain
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.960]   'cause he's just said that all these
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.320]   are not really that important.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.480]   And so there must be a greater gain.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.840]   And what is that?
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.880]   Contentment gives us a greater gain
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.280]   than what money could buy us.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.120]   But what gain is that?
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.800]   Now, we read to the next verse, it says,
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   "Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.480]   and into many foolish and harmful desires
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.280]   that plunge people into ruins and destructions."
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.560]   So what we see is the flip side.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.680]   If we don't have contentment,
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.680]   we're gonna fall into the temptations,
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.240]   we're gonna fall into these destructions.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.400]   So what is this greater gain that we could have
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.400]   if we have contentment is that we will not fall
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.960]   into these temptations, we will not be destroyed.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.480]   And so why?
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.500]   For the next verse, it says,
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.000]   "For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.360]   Some people eager for money have wandered from their faith
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.440]   and pierced themselves with many griefs."
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.760]   Which was the example that we've just used earlier.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.520]   Because, okay, so money is not the root
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.200]   of all kinds of evil, that's not what the verse says.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.320]   But the love of money is.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.200]   Now, why is because if our heart is already filled
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.740]   with all these desires for more things,
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.240]   we won't have a space to do what's right.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.280]   I mean, maybe you can say,
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.440]   "Well, I'm pretty sure all of us here, we don't love money.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.920]   I mean, we don't hate it definitely,
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.240]   but I mean, who hates it?
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.600]   Let me know 'cause then, yeah, anyways."
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.320]   Anyways, but rather or not you love money or not,
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.160]   it actually is a part of our everyday life, right?
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160]   The moment you wake up, the place that you live in,
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.040]   well, that costs money.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.040]   The breakfast that you have, well, unless you're fasting,
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.140]   you're having breakfast.
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.720]   And then the clothes that you wear,
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.280]   and then the job that you have,
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.640]   whether it's this one or that one
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.840]   is gonna be a big difference depending on the pay, right?
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.040]   And depending on the spouse you choose,
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.040]   you're gonna have a different lifestyle altogether.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.160]   So you see, the reason that it is the root,
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   the reason that the love of money
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.000]   can be the root of all evil
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.480]   is because it's tapped into every single part of our lives.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.840]   And so if we love it so much,
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.840]   then how can we choose between what God wants us to do
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.820]   and our own personal desires?
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.360]   How can we choose that?
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.160]   And so that's why we need to see
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.560]   that the love of money is the root of all evil.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.920]   And so I still remember a time,
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:54.440]   I mean, this is a pastoral letter,
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.780]   which means that it's really meant for leaders.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:57.880]   And you might be saying to yourself,
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.440]   well, I'm not a leader, so all this false teaching,
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.320]   I'm not leading church in that direction,
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.320]   what does that have to do with me?
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.600]   But the thing is, we need to guard ourselves
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.500]   against those teachings,
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.620]   as well as to know that we ourselves need to flee from it.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.440]   And so I remember a time when I went to a meeting
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.200]   in another church, not this one, not Kung Fu, okay?
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.760]   And where the pastor misused a part of the passage
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.920]   of Mark 4:20, and he said, you know,
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.180]   today, he told us that day,
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:36.180]   God is asking you to put all your money in your purse
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.940]   into the offering bag, and he's gonna bless it
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.160]   by 30 folds, 60 folds, 100 folds.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.920]   And in that moment, he also told us his testimony.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.500]   He said, when I gave all of my salary to God,
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:57.500]   actually, the following week, my money came back,
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.060]   and it was doubled as much.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.140]   Now, hearing what he said, both a little bit fearing,
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:07.000]   because he said, God told us, and also because,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.240]   well, it's also nice to double my money, right?
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.220]   So I said, okay, I'll put in all the money
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.820]   that I had in my wallet.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.220]   And I have to say, it's a little bit painful for me,
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.340]   because that day, I think I just came back from Canada,
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.060]   so I had about a few thousand dollars
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.020]   of Canadian dollars there.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.720]   So I was like, all of it, okay, all of it.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.740]   I'm glad I had my octopus card so I can go home.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.200]   And so a few weeks later, you know,
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.340]   it's kind of like, oh, you know, God,
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.340]   no, nothing's coming back, and, you know,
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.980]   I don't know where the doubling went,
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.740]   and I still vividly remember, you know,
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.860]   an impression from God that kind of said,
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.020]   well, I never said your money would double.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.100]   And what I wanted to say is, I mean,
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.020]   we need to be discerning.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.100]   I'm not saying that everybody, you know,
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.420]   sometimes we have hosts who comes up and say,
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.500]   okay, it's time for offer.
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.440]   I'm not saying that that's not good,
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.420]   but if you feel like you're being pushed to give,
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.820]   or you feel like that the preacher or the teacher
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.340]   is telling you that this is a means
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.780]   to gain financial gains, then we gotta be careful.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:20.940]   And so the second way, the first way is to flee
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.220]   from what is false, which is about ourselves,
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.660]   and also for the love of money.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.060]   Now, the second thing that we should do
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.780]   is to pursue these virtues.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.900]   Now, remember in verse 11, it says,
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.780]   we need to pursue righteousness, godliness,
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.620]   faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.620]   And interestingly enough, when we find this list,
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.100]   it's actually the exact opposite of what we heard earlier.
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.260]   I mean, righteousness is actually compared
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.940]   to foolish and harmful desires.
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.940]   And godliness with contentment,
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.260]   remember we talked about contentment.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.140]   Once we're content, we no longer need to go
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.900]   after these financial gains.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.100]   And again, faith, and then we won't be robbed of the truth.
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.300]   We won't be wandering from our faith.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.980]   We need to go after love, endurance, and gentleness.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.100]   So he's asking us, hey, go after these things.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.820]   Flee away from the bad and go after these things.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.500]   But this is one of the harder questions.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.980]   I mean, how can we pursue these things?
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.420]   'Cause it's easy to have a list.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.260]   I mean, how do you go about doing that?
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.900]   Well, it really is about this contentment
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.340]   that we talk about.
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.500]   If we are content with what God has given us,
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.100]   then why would our hearts be dragged away to somewhere else?
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.140]   I mean, imagine, I mean, if you see a nice car zooming by,
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.380]   right, don't start to imagine, well, it would be nice
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.540]   if I'm in that car, start imagining like a pretty girl
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.300]   next to you, right?
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.700]   Like be content.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.020]   Maybe you go on the bus, like wow,
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.980]   what a spacious bus I have, right?
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.700]   Look at your wife, beautiful, all the time.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.780]   And, or if you're like scrolling your Facebook, right,
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.260]   don't be like, oh wow, that's a big house.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.460]   Look at my apartment.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.780]   But be content.
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.140]   We can train ourselves to be content.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.780]   Maybe we'll repaint the walls, put some nice light.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.740]   Just be content.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.060]   And when we are, our hearts will not be pulled
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.300]   here and there, and we can pursue these goodness.
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.940]   And we can do good.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.740]   We can be, we can see the injustice in the world
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.220]   and we can go and we can like look after the widows
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.500]   and the orphans and we can have faith in God.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.300]   And so this nicely leads us into a third point,
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.500]   which is to take hold of the eternal life.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.420]   Now when we hear these, it seems that we know
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.980]   all these words, take hold, we know, okay.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.460]   Eternal life, we know.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.340]   Okay, how do we take hold of the eternal life?
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.340]   That we don't really know.
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.740]   But here it tells us, fight the good five of faith.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.860]   Take hold of eternal life to which you were called
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.420]   when you were made your good confession
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.180]   in presence of many witnesses.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.380]   Now the moment that we've received Christ into our lives,
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.060]   we have been called to a higher living.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.860]   We're no longer living for materials anymore,
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:21.860]   not for the temporal, but we're living for the eternal,
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.460]   something greater.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.140]   And in verse 13 and 14 it says,
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.460]   in sight of God who gives life to everything
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.880]   and of Jesus Christ, who while testifying
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.720]   before pointless Pilate, made the good confession,
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.140]   I charge you to keep this command,
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.640]   which is to make that good confession,
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.740]   without spot or blame until the appearing
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.020]   of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.200]   And Paul's really saying this, and he continues by saying,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.720]   which God would bring about in his own time,
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.400]   God the blessed and the only ruler,
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.320]   the King of kings and Lord of lords,
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.120]   who alone is immortal and who lives
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.200]   To him be honor and might forever, amen.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.880]   I mean, why does he put all those together?
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.160]   He's saying that if we are to take hold
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.920]   of this eternal life, we have to think about who God is.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.560]   I mean, a lot of times we think,
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.680]   oh, God is this loving father, you know,
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.920]   who take care of us wherever we are.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.080]   But look at all these words that he's putting out.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.880]   The blessed one, the only ruler,
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.160]   the King of kings and Lord of lords, we say that,
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.220]   but do we think about that?
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:42.380]   And who alone is immortal, unapproachable light.
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.860]   Wow.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.560]   You know, just like the song we sang earlier,
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.540]   you know, like glory and holy and how great is he.
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.580]   That is what our eyes needs to be fixated on.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.340]   And so, I mean, what does that life really look like?
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.300]   What is a life that's, you know, it's fleeing away,
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.700]   is running away from false teaching and love of money?
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.700]   What does a life look like?
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.100]   Who is pursuing all these goodness
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.020]   and taking hold of this eternal life?
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.660]   What's it like?
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.180]   Well, a few days ago, I saw a post online
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.900]   by my friend who shared about her mother.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.700]   They're both from Korea, but now my friends in Hong Kong.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.380]   And with her permission, I'm gonna share this with you.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.460]   It reads like this.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.300]   It's a Facebook post.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.380]   "Winter is approaching.
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.060]   "Got my mother a white sweater.
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.340]   "She's someone who finds hard to buy anything for herself.
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.540]   "Her whole life was for others.
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.480]   "How can a person be so other-centered?
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.480]   "Her DNA and heart is twinned so differently and beautifully.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:00.060]   "I've tried to educate her to spend some money on herself,
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:04.840]   "but realized her whole life pattern wasn't like that.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.660]   "It's easier for me just to observe what she needs
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.160]   "and gets it for her.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.660]   "That's it.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.360]   "When she left, temporarily, she says,
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.920]   "Africa, after 28 years of pouring her heart,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.040]   "all her belongings were able to be packed
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.860]   "in a small luggage.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:27.820]   "Even inside that, half was filled with her medical stuff,
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.280]   "goodbye cards from orphanage,
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.360]   "and special needs children she had been loving so dear.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.460]   "Her bank account had dollars,
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.280]   "just enough to buy a plane ticket.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.840]   "Nothing was invested.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.940]   "Three of us, my sister, brother, and I, had meetings.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.040]   "How to support her continually.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.040]   "I must say it was a burden, but a very thankful burden.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:59.380]   "I cannot understand how one's life can be so simple
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.300]   "and not attached to this world at all.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.460]   "Someone whose perspective, dreams, and treasures
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.820]   "are always on the things above.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.600]   "She is special.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.760]   "Her name is Sun Hee Lim.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.620]   "The kids of the orphanage call her Sunny."
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:23.120]   And so a few days ago, she just arrived to Hong Kong.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.200]   And now she's actually being quarantined,
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.520]   and I've sent her the link,
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.560]   so she's most likely online with us.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.680]   So she just wanted to say hi, Sunny,
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.840]   and you can all wave to her at the back.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.480]   Hi, Sunny, hi, Ara.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.820]   I mean, what a beautiful life this is.
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.120]   This is an extraordinary woman.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.120]   And she went to Namibia, Africa, for 28 years.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.800]   Now, early in her life, she was trying to find fundings
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.760]   from over 50 churches in Korea.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:59.200]   And each church would give her around $100 to $200,
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.200]   Hong Kong dollars, to support her.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.360]   Now, most of the missionaries would find at least 150%
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.400]   of what they need before they would leave the country.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.960]   But just with 70% of what she had, she already left.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.040]   And before she left, she gave everything that she had away,
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.280]   especially the clothes that needed dry cleaning.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.280]   Apparently, she knows that there's no dry cleaning in Africa.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.760]   And when she was there, she focused on evangelizing,
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:35.480]   Bible study, and supporting her husband's missions work.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.840]   In her later years, she focused on the special needs children.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.620]   But in 2003, she was diagnosed with cancer.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.360]   And in the same year, her husband passed away.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.160]   But that did not stop her from doing her missionary work.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:58.160]   Actually, over the next 10 years, she had over 10 surgeries.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.200]   And each of those surgeries,
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.880]   she had to remove an organ after an organ,
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.020]   because the cancer has spread to different places.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:13.600]   And yet each time, right after she finished her surgery,
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.560]   when she could just barely stand,
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.760]   she would go back to Africa.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:24.080]   Because she remembered the children, like all these photos,
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.440]   she remembered her, she remembered them in her hands,
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.480]   and she said she had to go back.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.520]   I mean, there were moments when she wanted to give up,
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.360]   because it was so painful.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.240]   Imagine going through all those.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.480]   And there was so much difficulties in front of her.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.400]   Do you know what she did in those times?
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.220]   She said she would read the Bible
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.320]   from Genesis to Revelation,
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.340]   day and night until it was finished.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.120]   And she said that kept her going.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:04.120]   It comforted her and gave her the strength to press on.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:09.400]   And so she didn't stop until 2009.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.920]   She came back, she went back to Korea,
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.440]   in which COVID limited her to go back again for now.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.880]   All the finances, all the funds,
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.180]   100%, she said, went to all the people.
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.300]   She did not have any investment of her own.
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.720]   No retirement plans, no NPF.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.440]   And yet she always looked above,
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.560]   trusting daily all that she has in need.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.220]   I'm very moved by her story,
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:43.160]   because I think, what are we doing?
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:48.120]   My question to you, to me also,
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.080]   what are we doing here?
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.280]   I mean, how many luggages of things
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.880]   do you and I have at home?
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.280]   I don't think I can pack all my shoes in one luggage.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.480]   I mean, how much of our resources
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.960]   do we do for the good of others?
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.700]   And how much hardship are we willing to endure for the Lord?
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:18.360]   I mean, are we equal to the glory of the Lord
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.320]   that we just talked about?
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.200]   The Lord of Lords, the King of Kings.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.920]   Are we thinking about ourselves most of the time?
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.560]   When we look at our internet search
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.400]   and see what we've been searching up the last few days,
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.200]   we can look at the bills that we pay
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.060]   and look at where it all went to.
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:41.420]   We'll have a better idea, a fact check.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:46.240]   And maybe to some extent, I think,
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.720]   we're not very different from the false teachers.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.280]   You know, sure, I mean, we don't go around
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.400]   using our Christian stand to try to sell you anything.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.820]   But maybe in our hearts somewhere,
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:03.920]   we actually think that God is for our own benefit
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.600]   to prosper us, to bless us.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.880]   And Paul does say, you know,
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:16.880]   he is there but for greater gain, an eternal one.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.880]   Except, I don't know, how often do we see that?
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:27.560]   How often do we take hold of this eternal life?
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.140]   Or are we still living for the temporal?
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.840]   Now, I'm not saying that Paul's telling us,
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.840]   you know, don't enjoy anything.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.480]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.520]   We should enjoy the toils of our work.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.780]   But what I am saying, and I believe that Paul is saying,
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.080]   is that, and later in the few verses which we won't get to,
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.420]   is to remind those, especially the wealthy ones,
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:58.360]   to do good, to do good, good deeds,
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:02.900]   to serve those, the orphans, the widows, the ones in need.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.480]   And so what may that look like to us?
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.600]   Maybe we'll support a kid if we can't go there.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.720]   And I don't think we should all
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.840]   fly out to Africa tomorrow.
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.740]   But maybe we'll support a kid in the third world country.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.220]   Maybe we have widows around us.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.820]   Maybe we'll visit them.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.360]   Orphans, let's buy them some gifts
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.340]   and share the time together.
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.380]   Maybe we'll volunteer for an organization
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.620]   that we believe is worthwhile.
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.540]   Maybe instead of buying new clothes,
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.380]   next time we pick it up, like, do I really need this?
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.620]   What can I do with this money?
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.100]   What can I do with my time?
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:50.580]   The love of money is the root of all evil.
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.920]   May we be content.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.500]   May we pursue all the goodness.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.780]   I mean, look at these photos.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.480]   I think it says and it tells us
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.620]   what it means to uphold that eternal life.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:09.360]   So I charge you today, and also myself,
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.360]   fight the good fight of faith.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.760]   Flee from those false teaching.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.220]   And the love of money is not about us.
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:23.020]   And for us to pursue what is good,
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.240]   when our heart is wide, when we're content, we can.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   And so always look and take hold of that eternal life
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.460]   which we are called to, because God is good
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:40.460]   and he's worthy of every ounce of our offering.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.100]   May he have all the glory.
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.320]   Let us pray together.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.100]   Dear heavenly Father,
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:52.740]   you are the King of kings and Lord of lords.
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.780]   You are the immortal, the unapproachable light.
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:00.780]   Oh, Father, help us to fix our eyes on you
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.220]   and to know that you've given us a greater gain
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.460]   than the materialistic world that we see.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.140]   Father, help us to live a life
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.720]   that is worthy of the calling that you have for us.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.260]   Father, help us each day to live just the way
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.520]   that you want us to.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:25.140]   May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.040]   May you have all the honor and glory.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.800]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
