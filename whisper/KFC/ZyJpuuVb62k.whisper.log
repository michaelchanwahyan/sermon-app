[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   You
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.160]   Last week I stood here
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.560]   introducing Susanna
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.960]   when I stood here I was
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.960]   69 years of old
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.120]   just
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.760]   Today
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.640]   I'm 70
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.240]   And
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.240]   had six days
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240]   Something
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.480]   Has changed. I
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.680]   am now in my eighth decade a
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:48.200]   Septuagenarian for those who like long words to put this in the context the same as Donald Trump
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.040]   By the way, I loved the dinner and
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.200]   There is nothing better in my humble opinion than a church eating together. Do you agree?
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.960]   and
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.320]   following last week's excellent talk by Susanna I
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.280]   want to talk today about
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.040]   change
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.040]   And I've called this week's sermon
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.040]   serving
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.040]   changes me
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.640]   But before I go further let me put this into perspective
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.400]   Serving will not save you
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.600]   I'm gonna repeat that again
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   Serving will not save you how we are saved is by faith in God's Son Jesus Christ
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.160]   and by accepting the free gift of salvation that could be paid for only by his precious blood
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.320]   No amount of good works
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.880]   No amount of good works
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.400]   no amount of good behavior or
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.520]   No amount of service
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.640]   Can save us from our sins?
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.160]   But read my lips
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:17.120]   We've each been saved in order in order to serve those around us do you get that?
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.880]   Christ called each of his disciples to follow him and he charged them with
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.920]   Doing things that he himself could have done in the blink of an eye
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.480]   and
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.400]   In the same way he will task us you and me
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.040]   With things to fulfill our purpose here on earth
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.600]   Remember our theme for this series
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.000]   saved people serve people
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.400]   And I want to make a very simple point today
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:59.800]   Serving is the quickest way to see change in our lives. I'll say it again
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.960]   Serving is the quickest way to
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.240]   See change in our lives. I want to ask you a rather obvious question
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.600]   Do you want to be more like Jesus?
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.680]   I've put the answer on the screen
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.760]   If you want to be more like Jesus
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.320]   Focus more on serving others than being served
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:37.720]   We'll be looking later at Matthew 20 28, you know it the Son of Man that's Jesus
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.160]   Came not to be served but to serve
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.280]   Philippians 2 7 but Jesus emptied himself
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.240]   by taking the very nature of a servant
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.240]   The best way we can make a difference in our workplaces
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.880]   to improve our marriages those who are married and
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.880]   Discover our spiritual gifts is to serve those around us
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.400]   Serving is the quickest way
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.760]   to see change in our lives and
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.040]   Tonight I'm going to be making four points. Yeah, I know
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.560]   Sermon should be three points, but I'm greedy right four points
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   First one is this
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.080]   serving increases my faith and
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.840]   To make my point I'm gonna do it dwell delve into a well-known
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.840]   Story the account of Jesus's first miracle that we know as turning water into wine
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.160]   Those of you were here on time tonight actually saying it right Jesus tells the story. Let me read it to you
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.400]   on the third day
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.560]   There was a wedding at Cana in Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.560]   Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.960]   When the wine ran out the mother of Jesus said to him they have no wine
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.680]   Jesus said to mom woman
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.720]   What does it have to do with me?
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.800]   My hour has not yet come
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.400]   His mother said to the servants do
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.200]   Whatever he tells you
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.920]   Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish rites of purification
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.000]   each holding 20 to 30 gallons Jesus
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.560]   said to the servants fill the jars with water and
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.920]   they filled them up to the brim and
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.640]   He said to them
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.640]   now draw some out and
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.680]   Take it to the master of the feast
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.160]   So they took it when the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine and did not know where it came from
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.480]   But the servants who had drawn the water knew the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:14.440]   Isn't everyone serves the good wine first and when people have drunk freely then they serve the poor wine
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.080]   but you
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.880]   Have kept the good wine until now
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:26.280]   this the first of his signs Jesus did at Cana in Galilee and
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.360]   manifested his glory and
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.480]   his disciples
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.480]   believed in him I
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.560]   Want to direct your attention to the use of the word?
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.600]   Servants it's in verse 5 and verse 9 and as an aside here G
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.920]   John uses the Greek word the ocanus from which we get our term deacons
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:57.760]   The servants are referred to in several more verses by the words either they them or you
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:05.680]   The point is it is these unnamed servants that I want to focus on
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.360]   Though Jesus could have filled the water pots merely by his word
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.080]   He preferred to use the servants
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.720]   That was such a blessing
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.120]   Because
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.320]   He still does that today
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.240]   and
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.000]   He wants to use you
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.120]   Let's look at it more closely
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:43.000]   Note there was firstly the want expressed verse 3 they have no one
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.560]   That was followed by the way explained fill the jars with water
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.160]   Then came the will exercise they filled them up to the brim and
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.240]   This was followed by the wonder experience
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.360]   The water was made wine
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.040]   What we've just witnessed here here is a miracle
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.160]   with a message I
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.520]   Put a quote on the screen
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:20.280]   Evangelist and prolific author dr. G Campbell Morgan once said this every parable that Jesus spoke
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.240]   was a message was a miracle of instruction and
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   Every miracle
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.680]   Jesus performed
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.480]   Was a parable of instruction. I'll say that again
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:39.440]   every parable Jesus spoke was a miracle of instruction and
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.640]   every miracle Jesus performed
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.920]   Was a parable of instruction
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.480]   Here we have a miracle
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.440]   That is filled
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.000]   with insight into Christian service
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.680]   It started with
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.760]   anxiety
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.760]   Which led to activity?
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.280]   Which leads to adequacy I
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:14.040]   Don't about you I was so moved by much of Susanna's talk last week
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.560]   Those slides man
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.680]   The Hong Kong rich poor gap
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.040]   Those who were living in caged dwellings and I think for me, especially the story of that child
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:31.920]   That was found dead at home after the mother's suicide attempts
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.280]   To be honest it troubled me
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.600]   It made me want to do something
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.680]   To see the deep needs met
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.760]   And what I want to do now is look at those three aspects
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.880]   Firstly the anxieties that troubled these servants
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.880]   Now in Palestine a wedding rather like in Hong Kong was a big thing
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.280]   In fact, the biggest thing going on in those days was a wedding
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:10.160]   The servants were troubled
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.280]   Because the wine has run out
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.680]   Because the wine has run out
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.320]   We find out of wine what
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:28.160]   We found out of wine what there is no more wine
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:36.000]   Nothing could be more devastating at an Eastern wedding than this
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.440]   The servants were troubled about the resources that were inadequate
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.160]   The servants were struggling with what they were to do
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:53.960]   For the F&B to fail was unacceptable as well as inexcusable. I
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.200]   Don't know if more people came than was expected
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.880]   Perhaps they're like Hong Kong people. They don't bother to RSVP. You know what I mean?
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.120]   But the wine ran out
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:13.360]   What were these servants going to do this was a crisis situation for these servants
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.200]   Everyone was looking to the servants to give them the wine
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.800]   But the resources ran out
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:30.320]   The servants were troubled about the reprimand that was inevitable
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   Now a bit of background here in Bible times wedding feasts could last up to a week and
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.160]   It was considered a crime
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.840]   For a host for a host to allow the the feast to run out of food or wine in
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:53.720]   Fact actually one was liable to be sued in a court of law
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.760]   Wow
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:03.960]   It could be costly both financially and socially to run out of food or wine
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.760]   No doubt the servants felt like quitting. I
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.160]   mean
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.360]   How would you feel they'd given all they had?
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.400]   And there was nothing more for them to give
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:26.640]   However, I love this verse 5 Mary speaks out in verse 5 some of the best advice known to man
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.440]   Mary pointed the men to Jesus
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:38.800]   Mary makes an announcement to the servants and it revolved around the authority of God Mary directed the servants
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:45.760]   Consciously to observe his orders without disputing or asking questions. This is what she said
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.360]   Do whatever he tells you
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:58.320]   Do whatever he tells you that could be our motto should be our motto for life, right?
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:06.240]   The second aspect is the activities which tested these servants
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:14.160]   Now draw out some wine and take it to the master of the feast. They were not given an easy task
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:20.680]   They didn't just take the water water pots to the taps because there weren't any
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.520]   There were no taps
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.000]   there must have been a spring or a well somewhere and
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.040]   They had to carry water to fill those water pots
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.680]   The six stone water jars that were used for ritual cleansing
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.720]   The weight of the water alone
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:51.200]   Was between 160 and 240 pounds in each jar
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:14:00.520]   That's well over a thousand pounds in total up to a hundred and sixty
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.080]   gallons of water by the way
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   That was how much wine there was going to be
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.760]   It is worth our attention
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.800]   to note
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   that Jesus
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.720]   employed the use of the servants I
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:22.080]   Mean Jesus could have filled these pots by merely speaking the word
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:30.280]   However, God loves to give us his servants an opportunity to labor with him
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.800]   God chose to use the servants to share in the work
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.280]   He who is a
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.800]   supernatural God
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.800]   chooses to use
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.080]   natural men to accomplish his work I
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.960]   Want you to consider two things?
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:57.640]   Firstly consider the apparent uselessness of Jesus's request
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.360]   They needed wine
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.560]   They needed wine not water
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.320]   These guys were said why do we need water?
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:13.480]   What Jesus had told them to do made no sense
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:21.920]   If Jesus had told them to go to the equivalent of Park and shop to go and buy some wine
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   It would have made perfect sense
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   However
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.960]   That would have been walking by sight
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.560]   and
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.960]   Jesus wanted them to walk by faith
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:41.440]   What they were told to do made no sense at all
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:48.600]   What does filling pots with water have to do with the need of wine
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:54.280]   They yell no gout well, you know, it's what what's going on here
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.480]   They were going to have to trust the Lord with this one
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:07.960]   The assignment of the servants revealed the secret of God's activity
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.920]   He was going to work through them
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:21.320]   Secondly consider the absolute thoroughness of the servants report response
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.560]   We read they fill them up to the brim
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.480]   Whenever we get a command from God
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:36.840]   It is always our wisdom to carry it out zealously
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.680]   I heard a story of a customer in a restaurant
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.320]   Who once asked the waitress?
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.320]   Suspiciously after seeing the menu
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.080]   She said why do you call this?
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.480]   Enthusiastic stew
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.280]   The waitress explained the cook put everything he has into it
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.880]   That's exactly what these servants did
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.840]   The wisest thing that we can do
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.200]   Is to obedient be obedient to the Word of God
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.080]   to the work of God and
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.600]   to the will of God
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.360]   The command was draw out now
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.080]   Draw out now
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.240]   Wow, that was amazing. Remember two weeks ago
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:30.080]   Interesting and reminded me of the passage of Jesus and the woman at the well in John 4
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.720]   and the third aspect is the
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.280]   Adequacy, which thrilled their soul. They were not going to run out again
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:47.600]   160 gallons is equivalent to around 800 of our bottles, right? It's a lot of wine
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.480]   The thing is
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:57.760]   When we've done all that we can do it doesn't mean that God is not able to do something
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:05.800]   When we've done all we can do it doesn't mean that he has done all he can do
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:12.040]   The servants had exhausted their ability
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.440]   But they had not
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.560]   But they had not
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.560]   expended his ability
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:26.760]   In the servants accomplishment we see the secret of the ability of God
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:35.680]   We know from the words of the ruler of the feast that the wine that they served at the beginning of the feast was the
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   Best they had on hand
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.520]   But it was far inferior
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.960]   To what Jesus provided later indeed the ruler of the feast
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:53.120]   Praised the bigram for what seemed to be wise planning. You saved the best wine to last
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.880]   And I thought about this
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.720]   Jesus always leaves people better off
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.120]   Than they were before he found them
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:09.440]   Jesus always leaves people better off than they were before he found them
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:17.440]   The governor was amazed at the unnatural keeping of the best wine to last
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:23.440]   But what puzzled the ruler of the feast
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.880]   Was actually no secret to the servants
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:34.480]   Think about the world the world offers you a lot
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.920]   But what the world does is this the world offers you the best at first
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.160]   And then once you're hooked into the things of the world things get worse
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.880]   But I believe the best is yet ahead for the child of God
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:57.800]   Grace always operates contrary to nature always leaving better things ahead for us
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:03.640]   Christ was the one to work the miracle
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.800]   Yet the servants were the ones who seemed to be doing everything
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:15.840]   They filled the water pots. They drew out the wine. They delivered it to the governor of the feast
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:21.640]   Christ pronounced no magical formula. He didn't even command the water to become wine
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.960]   What was witnessed by the spectators?
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.760]   was servants
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:35.160]   Though the means used were human the result was seen to be divine
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.280]   God's ability
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.520]   accomplished ministry through these servant servants
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.360]   The servants were used of God in bringing him glory
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.560]   The Lord performed the miracles
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.320]   But he used willing vessels to accomplish it
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:05.000]   The servants were only God's tools in bringing the miracle of the wine into the lives of people who were gathered
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.120]   The servants faith was elevated
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.200]   the master of the feast
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.880]   Didn't even see the miracle the guests at the wedding
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.320]   Didn't see the miracle
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.800]   But the servants did I thought this is just like real life
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.880]   We're sitting in here on a Saturday evening
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.760]   We haven't seen that Johnny's been
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:39.120]   With the young people in Titus this afternoon. We haven't seen that young man who who committed his life to Jesus
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.360]   I've heard outreach or at Titus
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.640]   When he's up there in China ministering to students we don't see it, but she's doing it
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.400]   Ken invited Claude who was in Beijing to alpha online
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:57.480]   Real life example, there's much ministry that God desires to do
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.680]   But what he desires is willing and available servants
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:08.200]   Johnny's and Winnie's and Ken's who are willing to have their faith stretched
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.840]   It leads me to point to
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:18.280]   You're hoping I get there eventually serving helps me discover what I'm made for
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:26.520]   Ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.720]   Which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them?
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:37.080]   Can I remind you we are not saved by works?
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:44.560]   But it is given to us so that we can be his workmanship his handiwork
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:53.340]   His masterpiece, I love that word masterpiece. I think of the Mona Lisa created by the master da Vinci
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.340]   I
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:02.300]   Want to go back to 1995 one of the reasons I'm standing here tonight 1995 I
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.500]   Was a businessman we running an Alpha course
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.700]   In Hong Kong in those days. It's always live talks
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:16.260]   Someone says we would you give one of the talks I can remember the talk. How does God guide us? I
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.380]   Was very nervous, but
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.700]   Yeah, I did the talk then
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:30.700]   Well, hey, I can still do this and next alpha course. I did two talks and next half after I did the weekend
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.860]   These little things that we do
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:38.500]   Can lead to something that God is creating in us
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.860]   his workmanship
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.860]   his handiwork
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.740]   His masterpiece and that is what Paul meant
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:53.300]   Peter also in 1 Peter 4 10 as each of us each has received a gift
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:24:01.060]   Use it to serve one another as good stewards of God's varied grace
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.220]   my friend you
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.100]   Have been gifted by God
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:13.780]   And I incredibly valuable to him and the church
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.580]   Let's move on to point three serving ads connection
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.900]   People describe what you're sitting through now as
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.180]   the English service
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.940]   I'll be honest with you. I've never wanted to run an
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.420]   English service I've always wanted to see
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.300]   this as family
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:43.700]   Rather than just a church service. It's why I'm passionate about our clans and our other small group activities
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.460]   Look at our music team. They don't just play instruments together
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.340]   Paul runs it as a family
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.820]   They laugh together cry together do life together
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:25:00.940]   Serving on a mission team is another great example. You go out on a mission team and you come back as family
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:05.980]   People I've been on mission teams with have become friends for life. I
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.580]   Guess what I'm saying is that serving together?
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.380]   Changes the person who's sitting into the next row
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.180]   to a colleague
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.180]   to a friend
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.220]   to someone we can do life with
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:28.260]   If I may use the Hong Kong example of property such a hot topic here
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.980]   When we make connections
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.300]   We move from being a guest in the house
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.420]   to a tenant
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.760]   To an owner a guest says I really love your church
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.820]   Tenant says I really love our church
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:49.820]   The owner says I really love my church
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:57.260]   I want each one of you to know that you matter you can say to yourself. I matter
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.700]   You don't feel like you you matter when you're just one of the crowd
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:10.740]   But you move from showing up to making yourself available
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:20.180]   And that's why I've called every one of us to be involved in this peace box initiative
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:25.140]   This is not about peace boxes
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.500]   It's about connection
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.540]   Which leads me to my point for my last point?
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.940]   Serving changes my focus
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.220]   The next passage I'm going to read is a key passage for our whole series
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.620]   Matthew 20 but Jesus called them to him and said
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:55.340]   You know the rulers of the Gentiles lord over them and their great ones exercise authority over them
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:59.380]   It shall not be so among you
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:04.900]   but whoever would be great among you must be your servant and
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.660]   Whoever would be first among you must be your slave
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:17.020]   even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.780]   a ransom for many in
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.940]   The run-up of this passage the disciples are angry
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:29.980]   Because James and John with the help of their mum wanted special privilege
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:36.460]   From Jesus in heaven they wanted the they wanted to be on the top table right left hand side right hand side
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:41.100]   Earlier in Matthew they'd argued about which one of them was the greatest
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.540]   Rivalry
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.460]   amongst the disciples
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:53.980]   For prominence in the kingdom set the stage for Jesus's summary teaching on greatness
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.060]   But hold on
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.060]   Before we're too hard on disciples
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:06.620]   Sober reflection reveals this struggle in all of us
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:11.340]   we often witness in places like Hong Kong a
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:16.220]   Struggle for face for position
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:21.380]   For title and the power and the privilege that comes with it
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.580]   even our churches
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.580]   the quest for prominence
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:32.020]   Frequently lurks in both pew and pulpit the desire for recognition
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.420]   often reveals a servant heart
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.300]   mixed with much pride
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.940]   Jesus presented a
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:48.460]   Revolutionary idea of greatness that is not found in worldly aspirations for prominence
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.860]   Namely what we call servant leadership
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:29:01.260]   Yes, there does need to be authority in life's relationships as seen in biblical teaching concerning family church and government
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.420]   but
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:08.420]   But when we seek these things as a means for self-promotion
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:13.660]   to gain personal prominence and control over others that
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.940]   resembles the world's ways more than Christ's ways and
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:23.540]   That calls for a deliberate change of focus
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:30.900]   Building on his teaching in Matthew 19 20 that the first shall be last
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.220]   the Lord Jesus defined greatness
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.380]   using himself as
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.340]   the example
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.340]   He rendered the ultimate
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.140]   servant act of
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.420]   substituting himself for us on
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.780]   the cross
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:57.380]   My prayer is that we as individuals and as a church
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.020]   Would be changed as
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:05.500]   We become more like our Lord and Master
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.620]   than like the world
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.900]   In
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:16.180]   1983 Graham Kendrick who wrote the song shine Jesus shine wrote a song called the servant King
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.140]   Will actually sing it in a moment
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.060]   But it finishes like this. I want you to take these words in
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.020]   So let us learn how to serve
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.740]   and in our lives in thrown him
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:35.140]   Each others needs to prefer
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.220]   For it is Christ
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.260]   We're serving
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:46.940]   And the chorus goes like this. This is our God the servant King. He calls us now
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.860]   to follow him
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.620]   to bring our lives as a daily offering of
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.780]   worship
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.780]   to the servant King
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.140]   Can we do that? I asked the band to come up
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:05.500]   I'm gonna ask you to stand
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.820]   And what we're gonna do we don't often finish like this is we're gonna read a prayer together
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:15.340]   I'm gonna put it on the screen in a moment. We're gonna read a prayer together and
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.260]   Then we're gonna sing the servant King
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:24.100]   If it's a song that's unfamiliar to you just look at the words, they're beautiful
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.940]   But we're gonna sing that together as we finish our service today
