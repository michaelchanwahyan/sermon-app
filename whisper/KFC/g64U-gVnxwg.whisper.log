[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440]   Good evening everybody. I said at the beginning of the year as I announced the Gong Fuk Church
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:21.360]   theme for 2023, equipping the saints and serving the community, that quite possibly our series
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:29.480]   on serving was going to be one of the most important in our church history. I believe
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:40.600]   our focus has begun to be shifted from ourselves to the world outside, to the poor, the orphan,
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:49.920]   the refugee and those who need the church to be the hands and feet of Jesus and not
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:01:03.640]   just a mouthpiece. You remember I talked about the need to go from us to you to them. It's
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:15.720]   left me with a dilemma. How do we follow that? The talks that we have received over the last
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.560]   couple of months from Susanna, from Green, from Joyce and Alia last week broke my heart.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:39.760]   They've led me to ask myself, what exactly is the gospel? What exactly is the gospel?
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.100]   The gospel is a term thrown around, often thrown around in Christian circles. In order
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:57.220]   to explain the gospel to others, it's important to understand what it is exactly. So let's
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:11.420]   unpack it quickly. The word gospel in Greek, euangelion, literally means good news. And
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.680]   it is mentioned over 90 times in the Bible. Broadly speaking, the gospel is the whole
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:30.700]   of scripture. The mega narrative of God's plan to restore humanity to himself. Specifically
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.700]   speaking, the gospel is the good news about Jesus. And yes, I could have kept singing
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.780]   that song all evening. That was amazing. Speak the name of Jesus. The story of who he is
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:55.880]   and what he did. But today's churches have taken this term gospel and often taken it
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:05.780]   to mean a meeting where we invite people to make a decision for Christ. After all, euangelion
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:16.940]   is a Greek word from which we get our English word evangelism. And certainly for me, when
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.500]   I became a committed Christian over 40 years ago, I became obsessed in getting people to
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:33.180]   make decisions to accept Jesus. My life was evangelistic. And I was a true evangelical
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.180]   in that sense. Feeding the poor, visiting the sick, caring for widows and orphans were
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:51.540]   clearly there in my Bible. I understood them. I supported them. But to be truthful for me,
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:02.180]   they were only there as a means to get someone to pray the sinner's prayer. In truth, my
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:15.420]   life was about decisions rather than discipleship. Can you see the difference here? Decisions
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:25.820]   and discipleship. I realised I'd put the term gospel in a box. I'd pigeonholed it. Yes,
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:36.540]   I got the bug for the gospel, but I wasn't looking at the whole picture. I decided to
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:47.580]   look to Jesus and the way he interacted, interacted with a wide variety of people. He was the
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:56.700]   complete picture. He was not just a soapbox preacher. It was rather like wanting to see
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:08.540]   Hong Kong from an eagle or a drone's perspective rather than a wild boar or an iPhone camera
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:17.660]   looking up at the Far East Finance Centre. As I began to look to Jesus, I was led to
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:30.100]   the very first time it was recorded that he spoke in church. It was in Nazareth, his hometown.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:37.260]   We read, he opened the scriptures at the passage that Bonnie read for us so beautifully from
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:44.980]   Isaiah 61. I really wanted her to read the whole chapter. Now, interestingly, every time
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:51.780]   there is a first in scripture, it is good to take note of it because often the Holy
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:59.300]   Spirit is laying down a special foundation or a principle or a doctrine. I believe this
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:08.980]   is the case of Jesus' first recorded sermon, which is found in Luke chapter four. He said
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:17.220]   this, "The spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.500]   the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:36.420]   blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour."
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:46.260]   In verse 21, the bit that he didn't get from Isaiah, Jesus said this, "Today, this scripture
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:56.100]   has been fulfilled in your hearing." So the Lord Jesus affirms that he is the one that
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:12.980]   Isaiah and all the prophets wrote of. He announces the salvation of God. He uses the word here,
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.980]   euangelia style. They write something like that, you tell me. It's a long word. It looks
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:26.300]   like a Thai word actually, but it's a Greek word. And it comes from euangelion. And it's
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:41.120]   for the expression to proclaim good news. The gospel is the good word of God to us.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:48.900]   It reveals the good God to us and the good Christ. And what we will see over the next
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:59.580]   12 weeks is that the good news, salvation, is more than a prayer at an evangelistic meeting.
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:08.700]   Let me say, important that is, and please don't stop doing it. You can't read through
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:18.860]   the gospels without seeing how much Jesus cared about hurting people. Can I say that
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:26.420]   again? You can't read through the gospel without seeing how much Jesus cared about hurting
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:38.060]   people. Just look at how he preached. He always started with the hurt, poverty, blindness,
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:48.220]   brokenness, imprisonment. You can tell a lot about a preacher by the way he addresses pain.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:57.820]   Jesus addresses it constantly. Why? Because he came to share the good news with hurting
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:12.820]   people. When people approach Jesus, they always came for one of three reasons. A need, a hurt,
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:24.740]   or a question. Jesus did not turn them away. Jesus did not turn them away. He never told
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.740]   them that they shouldn't have come for more, they should come for more doctrinally correct
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:41.900]   reasons. He just met their needs. In fact, he declared in his very first sermon, which
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:53.820]   we read earlier, as he started his public ministry, that was why he came to earth. And
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:01.300]   as a preparation for our series, I want to look at the background to this passage in
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.140]   Luke. The spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon me, he's anointing me to preach good
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:14.780]   news to the poor. Now notice the last line of this, "To proclaim the year of the Lord's
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:31.260]   favor." It's easy to miss that line, but it's critically important to understand God's heart
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:40.140]   for hurting people. When God created the nation of Israel, he established the year of the
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:47.220]   Lord's favor, which is called the year of Jubilee. It was a year when every debt would
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.980]   be canceled, every prisoner would be let go, every slave would be free, and all land that
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:11:01.140]   had been bought in the previous 50 years would revert back to its previous owner. But here's
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:12.500]   the interesting thing about the year of Jubilee. In the entire history of Israel, do you want
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:21.460]   to guess how many times they celebrated it? In the entire history of Israel, the children
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:35.580]   of Israel never followed it, even once. This angered God. In the book of Jeremiah, God
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:41.220]   told Israel he was sending the whole nation into captivity because the people hadn't obeyed
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:50.780]   this. And while they were in captivity, Isaiah wrote the words that Jesus preached in this,
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:12:00.060]   his first sermon. So as Jesus reads Isaiah's words in the synagogue in his hometown, he
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:10.860]   was boldly proclaiming this, "I, I am the day of Jubilee, when everyone's sins and debts
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:23.920]   are wiped out." I want to put this into context by looking at where it falls in scripture
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:30.100]   and where it falls in the life of Jesus. If we go through Luke's gospel, what we'll see
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:36.020]   is that Jesus had been baptized by John the Baptist in the River Jordan, as shown in Luke
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:40.720]   3. I'll put it on the screen. Now when all the people were baptized and when Jesus also
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.100]   had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were open and the Holy Spirit descended on
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:54.180]   him in bodily form like a dove and a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved son.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:04.100]   I am well pleased." If we just move down to chapter four, we see this. And Jesus, full
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:11.620]   of the Holy Spirit, remember he'd been baptized, returned from the Jordan and was led by the
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:21.820]   Spirit into the wilderness for 40 days, being tempted by the devil. He was tempted by Satan
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:27.340]   for 40 days. And then we read, if we turn our fingers down a little bit to verse 14
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:37.480]   and 15, "And Jesus," this is after 40 days, "returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.380]   And a report about him went out through all the surrounding country and he taught in their
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:51.060]   synagogues being glorified by all." Let me just put this in summary. He was baptized
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:14:00.740]   in water and in the Spirit in the river Jordan. He was led by the Spirit to be tempted by
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:12.420]   the devil in the desert. He returned in the power of the Spirit to begin his ministry
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:20.100]   having overcome the temptations. I want to look at this a little bit more closely. And
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:27.820]   I want to use the Father's affirmation of Jesus, "You are my beloved Son. With you,
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:36.160]   I am well pleased." In Luke 3.22, to get down to some truths that affect every one
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:45.820]   of us. During Jesus' baptism or graduation, his heavenly Father identified three foundational
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:53.820]   truths that were essential to Jesus' public life and ministry. He acknowledged his pleasure
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:15:02.020]   that his Son had succeeded in understanding and applying these to his life. It appears
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:09.700]   that these three factors were central to Jesus' preparation. It may also help us understand
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:21.260]   why it took Jesus 30 years to prepare for a three-year ministry. Ten times as long sharpening
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:29.900]   the axe than the time actually spent cutting down trees. Let's look at what appeared to
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:36.700]   be the three primary foundation stones of Jesus' life and ministry. They're all in verse
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:46.460]   22. Number one, "You are my Son." Jesus had come to learn who his Father was and what
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:57.460]   his true identity and value was from his Father's perspective. Number two, "Who my love." Jesus
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:04.940]   had a tested and proven knowledge of his Father's love. His relationship with his Father was
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:13.580]   secure. It was not based on performance. Hong Kong parents, it wasn't about how many grade
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:23.700]   A's he scored. Just saying. "With you, I am well pleased." Jesus had learned that his primary
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:30.300]   purpose and motivation for life and ministry was bringing joy and glory to his Father above
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:39.340]   anything and everyone else. And remember, my friends, this was before Jesus had done
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:52.340]   any ministry. It gets interesting. Immediately following this occasion, Jesus was affirmed
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:17:00.260]   by his Father and anointed for public ministry. We read he was led by the Holy Spirit into
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:07.980]   the wilderness to be tempted by the evil one. Now the interesting thing here, the feature
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:19.620]   is exactly what the temptations were targeting. Satan always does this. In the Garden of Eden,
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:27.900]   God has said to Adam and Eve, "You can eat of any tree apart from this one." What did
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:35.940]   Satan say? Did God really say? That's the way he tempts us. Did God really say that
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:45.540]   to you? And Satan, the deceiver, the father of lies, is trying to undermine the Father's
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:55.180]   declaration over Jesus. God says, "You're my son." Satan says, "If, if you're the son
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:03.900]   of God, tell these stones to become bread." God says, "Whom I love." Satan says, "In
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:11.620]   effect, throw yourself down. If God loves you, he'll send his angels." God says, "In
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:17.820]   you, I'm well pleased." Satan says, "All this I will give you if you will bow down
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:24.060]   and worship me." He was saying, "In effect, forget your purpose. Forget the cross. I can
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:33.780]   give it to you now." Shortcut. Satan questions Jesus' identity, his relationship with his
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:40.620]   Father, and his purpose in life. And by doing this, tempts Jesus to prove his sonship and
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:47.100]   significance. He pressures him to take things into his own hands by not waiting for his
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:57.620]   Father's leading or provision. But Jesus, my hero, according to Scripture, "Man shall
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:04.540]   not live by bread alone. Do not put the Lord your God to the test. Worship the Lord and
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:10.700]   serve him only." He shows he is secure in who he is. He's confident of his Father's
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:18.620]   love and is focused on pleasing his Father above all else by choosing to not give in
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:29.060]   to this temptation in spite of his life-threatening thirst and hunger. Accepted, secure, significant.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:37.100]   His beloved child whom he loves in whom he is well pleased. And my friends, this is so
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:51.940]   important. I'll tell you why. Because then, and only then, is he able to declare, "The
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:57.340]   Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:09.140]   the poor, etc." As he returns to Galilee, we read, "In the power of the Spirit." Can
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:14.460]   you see what happened? He was led by the Holy Spirit into the desert. He came out of the
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:22.580]   desert in the power of the Holy Spirit. Now, the first four books of the New Testament,
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:29.020]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, are collectively known as the four gospels because these four
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:36.540]   books tell us about Jesus Christ, his birth, his life and teachings, his crucifixion, and
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.860]   his resurrection. Our 12 sermons over the next 12 weeks will be taken from these four
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:51.940]   books. Now, in a sense, these four books are good news because they culminate the story
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:58.380]   of the Old Testament. They're fulfilling the promise of the cross and resurrection
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:05.900]   that's found in the 39 books of the Old Testament. The anticipation of a rescuer and longing
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:14.740]   for a messiah has been the dominant theme for centuries, marked by failure and captivity.
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:23.460]   Yet in another sense, these gospels are good news because they record for us the story
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:32.580]   of the greatest life ever lived. They're not just biographies, although they do give
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:40.040]   us the necessary details of Jesus' life. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are also witnesses
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:46.020]   to us, telling us that the word became flesh and lived among us to bear our griefs, carry
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:55.540]   our sorrows, and forgive our failings. But most of all, we see in the gospels the true
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:04.660]   story of Jesus as he lived out his mission to reveal the Father to us. In John chapter
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:15.740]   1, the apostle John makes a dramatic statement about why Jesus came. "No one has ever
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:27.820]   seen God. The only begotten Son who is at the Father's side has made him known." Jesus
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:36.800]   came to show us the Father, whose love for the world could only be satisfied by offering
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:46.060]   his Son as payment for our sin and brokenness. And Jesus has declared the heart of the Father
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:51.820]   by showing that heart. And that's what we're going to be seeing week after week over the
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:23:00.740]   next three months. John 14, 9 says this, "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father." But what
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:07.900]   did people who lived alongside Jesus see? That is what we're going to be exploring over
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:16.820]   the next 12 weeks. What we'll see is this, Jesus values people. The gospels share story
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:24.140]   after story in which he restores, comforts, transforms, and challenges people in an intimate,
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:31.700]   individual way. Our series is called Seeing the Heart of Christ. It tells the stories
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:39.060]   of 12 personal interactions that Jesus had with hurting people and how he dramatically
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:47.660]   changed their lives. By exploring the rich texture of these stories, we'll see the greatness
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:56.100]   of Christ's love as well as your deep need for him. In response to his example of compassion
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:07.700]   and mercy, you can't help be motivated to love and care for others. This series, I believe,
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:18.540]   will draw you closer to the Lord Jesus and help you understand the heart of God.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.140]   So this is what we're going to be looking at one by one. Next week, Johnny's going to
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:31.820]   be here and be talking about a heart that touches Jesus and a leper. The horror of a
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:44.420]   disease that was seen as a walking death, compounded by that person being declared unclean,
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:54.460]   untouchable, and he would have to enjoy his fate alone in solitary confinement. We will
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:25:03.000]   see what happens when one leper came to Jesus at the beginning of his ministry with the
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:12.900]   desire to be made clean. The week after that, James will be here with a heart that marvels.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:21.420]   We're going to be looking at Jesus and a centurion. This centurion is concerned about his servant
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:28.840]   who is lying at home paralyzed and from a position of authority, adopts one of humility
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:37.040]   and approaches Jesus in faith that Jesus will answer his cry. Then Michelle will speak to
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:44.740]   us on Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Mary Magdalene was a woman with a past, the subject of gossip
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:50.780]   and ridicule. But then she meets Jesus, who is not going to remind her of her past, but
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:57.180]   show her a way to a different future. And then we have Paul. It's great to have Paul's
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:05.020]   parents in tonight. Very welcome. Paul's going to be speaking about Jesus and two daughters.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:11.740]   We will watch unfold a story of Jairus, a desperate dad whose daughter was dying, a
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:16.660]   desperate woman who'd been bleeding for 20 years, and a dramatic rescue that came to
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:25.420]   them both after meeting Jesus. And James will share with us a heart that confronts Jesus
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:33.580]   and a Pharisee. We will see that true confrontation comes from a caring enough for the person
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:40.820]   and comes from a deep sense of our own spiritual frailty. Jesus's interaction with the Pharisees
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:48.420]   was always done with love and genuine care. I'll speak the week after about Jesus and
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:56.740]   the Canaanite woman. Here we'll see a tension of a woman, a foreigner, persistently shouting
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:03.940]   out for Jesus's help and his disciples persistently calling for her to be sent away. Jesus demonstrates
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:10.860]   his love for the marginalized and responds to her persistence. The week after that is
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:16.700]   Jesus and a blind man. Johnny will speak to us. We will see an unconventional way of Jesus
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.540]   dealing with a blind man that the disciples brought him. As we look at Jesus's authority
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:28.380]   of a physical and spiritual blindness. And then we welcome back Gabe the week after.
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:35.820]   Jesus and a hurting dad. Story of a demon possessed boy. Jesus, whilst not ignoring
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:42.860]   the boy, focuses on the pain of the father. This characterizes the love of Jesus for hurting
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:51.020]   people. Michelle will then talk to us about Jesus and a tax collector. Famous story of
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:56.460]   a rich despised tax collector, Zacchaeus, we all know him, whose life took a 180 when
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:03.100]   Jesus decided to call him down from the tree and go to his home for tea. The week after
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:08.820]   that I'll speak about Jesus and a guilty woman. The story of the woman caught in adultery
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:14.460]   and Jesus' response to her is a wonderful example of this thing we call grace. I'll
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:19.260]   be focusing on that that week. Johnny will be talking the week after that, a heart that
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:25.740]   values Jesus and a man born blind. This is a special one for me and the Israel team.
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:31.260]   Remember we were at the pool of Siloam a few years ago where this actually happened. And
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.260]   as I was sharing at the pool of Siloam, we suddenly got a crowd come around us and we
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:39.620]   end up praying for everybody. Do you remember that? But we look into this special story
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:47.180]   of a person born blind and the special meaning behind his encounter with Jesus. And then
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:53.820]   James will conclude our series by talking about Jesus and Pilate. Pilate, what's he
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:59.580]   doing here? He was facing pressure from all sides, the crowd, the authorities, his wife,
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:07.620]   his conscience. We will see how Jesus in his final hours reacted whilst maintaining his
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:13.660]   caring heart. Now I've given you the next 12 weeks, but what does that mean for us?
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:23.860]   What does it mean for us today? Jesus came to help hurting people, whether they're in
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:30.740]   debt, whether they're in bondage to sin, whether they're imprisoned or all three. As we see
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:37.460]   Jesus interacting with the hurting people of his day, we see he is not just relieving
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:45.140]   people's pains and struggles. We will see in every case something of the father and
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:55.260]   the father's love that Jesus is declaring. Those same broken people God came to heal
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:11.220]   2000 years ago are here today and Jesus wants us to serve them. You remember a couple of
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:16.980]   weeks ago I talked about Jesus and the washing of the feet. I want to repeat a verse. For
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:29.860]   I have given you an example that you also should do just as I have done to you. Are
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:41.060]   we as individuals, are we as a church, are we as a city following Jesus' example by hurting,
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:53.820]   by helping hurting people? Jesus' heart for hurting people is a reflection of the heart
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:31:07.940]   of the father. My friends, that really is good news. As I ask the band to come back,
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:16.420]   may we be the ones who can sing, "The spirit of the sovereign Lord is on me now to love,
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:27.900]   to speak, to heal, to preach. The spirit of the sovereign Lord is on me now giving life."
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:28.540]   Let's all stand.
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.540]   [Applause]
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:29.540]   [End of Audio]
