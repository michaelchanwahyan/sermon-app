1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
各位親愛的弟兄姊妹,主內平安

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,400
Dear all brothers and sisters, shalom

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:17,900
讓我先祝賀錦宣家三十九歲生日快樂

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,900
May I first send my greetings and wishes to

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,400
Farewell Park Alliance Church for this 39th anniversary

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,600
Happy birthday

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,900
今日我們選擇的經文是

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:46,000
大家好熟悉《史道行傳》一章開始的記載

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,500
Today we are going to look at the book of Acts chapter 1

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,600
The beginning of this book

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,400
你說我都識背了,還有什麼好說的?

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,500
Or maybe you would say I know this verse as well, what to talk about?

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,900
我連耶路撒冷、猶太傳、地撒瑪利亞直到地極都背得準確

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,100
I can memorize the verse in Jerusalem, in all Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth

15
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,200
好,你不要看聖經,回答我下面這個問題

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,000
Ok, now, please do not refer to the Bible and answer me this question

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,100
耶穌在一章八節講聖靈是第幾次講到聖靈?

18
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,600
When Jesus talked about the Holy Spirit in verse 8

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,100
How many times did He talk about this?

20
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,000
從第一節開始,耶穌講了多少次聖靈?

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,700
Ever since verse 1, how many times did He mention about the Holy Spirit?

22
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
不知道啊,who cares?

23
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,800
I don't know, who cares?

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,900
要知的

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,300
You have to know

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,600
你看看聖經

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,100
Refer to the Scriptures

28
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,700
耶穌在第二節提到聖靈

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,500
藉著聖靈來吩咐使徒

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,000
In verse 2, He said

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,500
After giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the Apostle He had chosen

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,800
這是教導我們三一真神彼此的關係

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,900
This is about the relationship between the triune God

34
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,500
第五節,第二次講到聖靈

35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,800
In verse 5, this is the second time that the Holy Spirit is mentioned

36
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,100
這裡講聖靈的洗

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,500
It mentions baptized with the Holy Spirit

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,100
就是講《舍行傳》第二章發生的事情

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,400
This is about chapter 2 in the book of Acts

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,300
所以我們不要隨便想像什麼叫做聖靈的施洗

41
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:58,900
Please do not just think about what is baptized with the Holy Spirit by your own mind

42
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,700
其實來到第八節

43
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,900
這就是第三次講聖靈降臨

44
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,200
And in verse 8, it should be the third time

45
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,900
that the Scripture mentions about the Holy Spirit

46
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,700
不要用check room來投票

47
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,500
唯有不用你舉手

48
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,700
你告訴我這樣的答案對不對?

49
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,500
Do you think this answer is correct?

50
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,400
不對

51
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
No, it's not

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,600
因為你漏了最重要的那次

53
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,500
Because you have missed out the most important time

54
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,000
沒有啦,我看到是三次講聖靈的

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Well, I did not see the fourth time

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,200
第六節

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,500
Verse 6

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
他們聚集的時候

59
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Then they gathered around him

60
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
為什麼他們要聚集呢?

61
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,300
Why do they have to gather?

62
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,300
第四節說

63
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,800
耶穌和使徒聚集的時候

64
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
Verse 4 said

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,500
When Jesus gathered with the apostles

66
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,000
耶穌祝福他們說

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,200
Jesus gave them this command

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,800
不要離開耶路撒冷

69
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,600
Do not leave Jerusalem

70
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,200
要等候父所應許的

71
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,600
But wait for the gift my Father promised

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,900
等什麼?

73
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,700
What to wait for

74
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
等誰?

75
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,800
Who to wait for

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,800
誰是父所應許的

77
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,200
Who is the Father promised

78
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,800
聖靈

79
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,900
The gift, the Holy Spirit

80
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,800
所以這段經文最重要的那句講聖靈

81
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
是故意不講的

82
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,500
That's why the most important part

83
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,400
that talks about the Holy Spirit

84
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
it was not mentioned

85
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,800
英文我們叫做loud silence

86
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
有沒有聽過?

87
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,500
In English, it's called loud silence

88
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,800
不講就是最重要那句

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,200
If you don't talk about it

90
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,800
it is the most important

91
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,200
因為這是耶穌的祝福

92
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,800
Because this is Jesus' command

93
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,200
這是他們聚集的原因

94
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,100
This is the reason why they gathered

95
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,800
這是父神所應許

96
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,500
This is what the Father promised

97
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,200
這也是主耶穌曾經跟使徒說過的

98
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,500
他們聽過的

99
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,200
And this is what Jesus had told the apostles about

100
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,000
所以我們的印象就是

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,200
耶穌叫他們來就送他們去

102
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,000
So we always have this impression

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,400
that Jesus comes and sends the disciples

104
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,200
馬太福音、馬學福音是這樣說的

105
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,100
In the book of Matthew and Mark, it said so

106
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,600
你又會背了

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,100
I know you can memorize that

108
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,700
所以你們要去

109
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,000
Therefore you go

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
使萬民作我的門徒

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,800
Make disciples

112
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,100
你們往普天下去

113
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
傳福音給萬民聽

114
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,500
Go to the world and preach the gospels

115
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,700
我們沒有時間了

116
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,200
We don't have enough time

117
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
曾牧師給我三十分鐘

118
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
還要扣上全譯

119
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,300
Pastor John gave me a limited time

120
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,900
你回去看《路加福音》二十四章

121
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,200
You can refer to the book of Luke, chapter 24

122
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,600
四十六節到五十二節

123
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,900
很長的

124
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,400
Verse 46 to 52

125
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,300
It's a long passage

126
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,600
耶穌祝福他們

127
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,300
不要離開耶路撒冷

128
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,500
Jesus gave them the command

129
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,900
Do not leave Jerusalem

130
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,000
要等候父所應許的

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,500
But wait for the gift my father promised

132
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,300
你衝了出去

133
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,100
就留了最重要的東西

134
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,400
If you just go with your own will

135
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,500
and you left the gift behind

136
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
所以不要這麼快

137
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Don't rush

138
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
去之前

139
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Before you go

140
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,700
要等候

141
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,800
There's a wait

142
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,100
等誰?

143
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,300
Who to wait to?

144
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,800
不是等法叔

145
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,300
是等候聖靈

146
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,900
It's waiting for the Holy Spirit

147
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,600
這些不能翻譯的

148
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,900
對不起

149
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,100
但是《史道行傳》比《路加福音》更詳細

150
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,500
The book of Acts

151
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,100
describing these in more details

152
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,300
因為他們聚集的時候

153
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,700
耶穌祝福他們等候聖靈

154
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,400
Jesus gave his command to them

155
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,300
that they have to wait for the Holy Spirit

156
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,400
到主耶穌最後一次提聖靈降臨這句說話

157
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,400
When Jesus mentioned

158
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,100
the Holy Spirit descending to them

159
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,000
其實前面還有一個連接詞

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,300
conjunction

161
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,600
In fact, there is a conjunction

162
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,400
before everything he said

163
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,800
那個不是一個普通的

164
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,800
and or but

165
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,200
這麼簡單的連接詞

166
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,800
It is not just a conjunction

167
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,200
like and or but

168
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,400
希臘文alaa

169
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,500
這個是一個很強調的連接詞

170
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,800
In Hebrew, it says alaa

171
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,800
但聖靈降臨

172
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,600
But the Holy Spirit descends

173
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,200
可能英文要說however

174
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,300
In English, we may say however

175
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,400
加重語氣

176
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,300
emphasize it, however

177
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,400
前面說什麼

178
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,100
What was before that

179
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,200
為什麼後面要加個但字開始

180
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,300
Why did the word however was mentioned in the scriptures

181
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,900
因為我從來讀聖經都不讀這些

182
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,200
You may say, oh, I don't know

183
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,100
I never realized

184
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,800
我讀聖經就是問有什麼教訓

185
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
我衝出去做

186
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,800
I believe the scriptures tell me what to do

187
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
and I just go and do it

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,400
先聽清楚耶穌說什麼

189
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,800
Please listen carefully to what Jesus said

190
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,200
第一,他叫我們等候聖靈

191
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,100
First, to wait for the Holy Spirit

192
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
第二,他提到聖靈之前

193
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,600
他有個連接詞說

194
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,000
但聖靈降臨

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
before waiting for the Holy Spirit

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
there is a conjunction, but

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,600
上半句耶穌是在回答使徒的問題

198
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,800
In the first part, he was answering the apostles' questions

199
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,800
上半節和下半節

200
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,600
哪半節重要些

201
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,300
What Jesus said is more important

202
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,200
the upper verse or the lower verse

203
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,600
當然是下半節聖靈降臨

204
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,100
You may say, oh, of course

205
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,500
those things that he said later

206
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,100
你明不明白我們的問題出在哪裡

207
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,600
Do you know the problem

208
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,200
我們讀聖經很霸道

209
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,800
When we read the scriptures, we are very

210
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,100
耶穌明明說了上下兩半

211
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,300
我們截了上一半

212
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
我們只說下一半最重要

213
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,800
Jesus mentioned two things

214
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,600
and we just pick one only

215
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,300
行不行呢

216
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,400
Do you think that's okay?

217
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,000
耶穌回答使徒什麼問題呢

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,400
What did Jesus answer to the disciples?

219
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,900
主啊,我讀的是和合本

220
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,200
祢復興以色列國

221
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,200
就在這時候嗎

222
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Lord, are you at this time

223
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,200
going to restore the kingdom to Israel?

224
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,900
復興

225
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,200
Restoration

226
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
你說這個是很屬靈的

227
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
我們要教會復興

228
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,200
We would like the church to be restored

229
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,700
三十九年的歷史

230
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,300
前面的三十九年

231
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,600
我們祈求復興

232
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,900
感謝讚美主

233
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,800
We have 39 years of history

234
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,500
and we look forward to this restoration

235
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,000
對不起

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,600
這裡不是在說復興教會

237
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,300
I'm sorry

238
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,400
This is not about restoration of the church

239
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,700
我們一見到復興兩個字

240
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,500
就跳進了我們的結論裡

241
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,700
不可以的

242
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,700
When we look at the word "restore"

243
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,400
we just conclude the verse is about restoration

244
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,200
and it's not correct

245
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
復興誰

246
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,100
Who to be restored

247
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,700
復興以色列

248
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,500
Restore Israel?

249
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,100
不是

250
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,100
復興以色列國

251
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,900
Restore the kingdom of Israel

252
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,900
懂得聽這句話嗎

253
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,600
Do you understand this verse?

254
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,800
在羅馬帝國統治之下

255
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,600
Under the Roman Empire

256
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,100
試圖問這個問題要很小心

257
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,200
When the apostles ask this question

258
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,500
they have to be extra careful

259
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,600
沒有23條有國安法

260
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,300
We don't have a law 23

261
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,600
but we have national security law

262
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,800
明白《使徒行傳》第一章嗎

263
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,500
Do you understand this?

264
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,000
明白了

265
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,200
醒了

266
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,400
Do you understand?

267
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,800
試圖問的是一個政治的問題

268
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,300
What the apostles were asking

269
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,600
were the political questions

270
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,400
耶穌如何回答這個政治的問題呢

271
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,400
How did Jesus answer this political question?

272
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,100
上半重要還是下半重要呢

273
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,000
Is the upper part more important or the lower part more important?

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,700
看你什麼顏色

275
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,200
Depends on your colour

276
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,800
不是這樣讀聖經的

277
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,600
No, it's not the way we read the scriptures

278
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
耶穌的答案

279
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,200
Jesus' answer

280
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,400
我們真的要小心聽

281
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,000
We have to listen carefully

282
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,200
因為他的答案其實是背著舊約聖經的金句

283
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,600
Because his answer refers to the Old Testament

284
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,100
如果我們不懂的話

285
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,000
我們很容易誤會了耶穌的意思

286
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,700
If we don't fully understand

287
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,100
we might misunderstand Jesus' teaching

288
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,800
起初神創造天地

289
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,000
你知道我背著創世紀一章一節

290
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,200
In the beginning

291
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,700
God created the heaven and the earth

292
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,300
That was in Genesis 1:1

293
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,100
耶和華是我的目者

294
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,200
你知道我背著四篇二十三篇

295
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,000
The Lord is my shepherd from Psalm 23

296
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You all know that

297
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,700
我的神

298
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,300
為什麼離棄我

299
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,600
My God, why do you abandon me?

300
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,100
你知道耶穌背著哪一章聖經嗎

301
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Do you know which verse Jesus refers to?

302
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,200
啊!耶穌好痛苦在十字架上大叫救命啊

303
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,300
錯了

304
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,500
Oh, Jesus, when he was crucified on the cross

305
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,300
He was in such pain that he screamed

306
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,300
耶穌不是痛苦叫救命啊

307
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,600
No, Jesus is not screaming because of the pain

308
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,500
我只看到你的眼睛

309
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
我看不到你的樣子

310
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
戴了口罩

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
不過我看到你好像不知道我在說什麼

312
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,200
From where I stand, I can see your eyes

313
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,200
And I guess you are wondering what I'm talking about

314
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,300
耶穌是背著四篇二十二篇第一節

315
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,200
Jesus was referring to Psalm 22, verse 1

316
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,100
四篇二十二篇全篇所說的主題

317
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,100
正正就是上帝從來都沒有離開過

318
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,600
In Psalm 22, the passage was about

319
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,300
God has never left us

320
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,400
環境看來,我們會問上帝往哪裡去了?

321
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,000
When we look around, we may ask where did God go?

322
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,300
但是Cp 22篇正正就是說不要看周圍

323
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,000
But Psalm 22 teaches us not to look around our surroundings

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
所以你不知道耶穌背著這句

325
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,900
你就解錯了他的意思

326
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,000
If you do not know that Jesus was referring to the Old Testament

327
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,200
you might have got the wrong meaning

328
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,200
拿著雞毛當靈箭

329
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,400
You have another idea

330
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
不可以的

331
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
No, that's not right

332
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,700
請問耶穌在這裡背著哪一節金句?

333
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,600
Which verse is Jesus referring to?

334
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,000
以塞俠書49章第6節

335
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,700
It is from Isaiah 49, verse 6

336
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,600
沒有印出來給大家

337
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,400
I did not print it out for you guys

338
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,500
你有iPhone請你點擊以塞俠書49章第6節

339
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,900
If you have your phone

340
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:10,200
please turn to Isaiah 49, verse 6

341
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,600
我讀給大家聽

342
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Let me read it for you

343
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:34,800
「現在他說:你作我的僕人,使雅各眾之派復興,使以色列中德保存的歸回尚為小事。」

344
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:42,400
He said, "It is too small a thing for you to be my servant

345
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,100
to restore the tribes of Jacob

346
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,200
and bring back those of Israel I have kept."

347
00:16:49,200 --> 00:17:01,000
「我還要使你作外邦人的光,叫你施行我的救恩,直到地極。」

348
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,800
「I will also make you a light for the Gentiles,

349
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,200
that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth.」

350
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,500
看到耶穌引用的這句金句嗎?

351
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,400
Now you see which verse does Jesus refer to?

352
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,400
那你才明白什麼叫做「直到地極」

353
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,300
Then only then you understand what does it mean by the ends of the earth.

354
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:30,100
《使徒行傳》28章保羅去到地極了嗎?

355
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,000
In the book of Acts 28, does Paul reach the ends of the earth?

356
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,800
你一定是另投說「未」

357
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,600
I am sure you will say no.

358
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,700
都未去到南極、北極

359
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,900
It never reached Antarctica and the Arctic.

360
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,200
那裡只有北極熊和企鵝

361
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,300
No, there is only polar bears and penguins.

362
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,800
那你起碼要來中國、印度、四大文明古國

363
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,500
At least you have to come to China.

364
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,900
不是

365
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,600
《以賽亞書》49章第6節很清楚說

366
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,800
It is clearly said in this verse

367
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:20,500
「地極」和「外邦」是平衡的同義詞

368
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,500
The meaning of the ends of the earth and the Gentiles are parallel in meaning.

369
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,200
所以《路加福音》24章如果你回去真的看一看

370
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,500
你就會發覺那裡不是說地極

371
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,100
那裡是說「萬邦」

372
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,600
If you look at Luke 24

373
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,500
It was not talking about the ends of the earth

374
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,800
but it is about all nations.

375
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,200
保羅去到地極了

376
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Paul reached the ends of the earth.

377
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,700
因為條條大道通羅馬

378
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,200
Because all routes go through Rome.

379
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,900
羅馬就是外邦世界的中心

380
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,900
Rome is the center of the Gentiles' world.

381
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,900
所以《使徒行傳》28章停在羅馬是地極

382
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,100
Therefore when the book of Acts stops at Rome

383
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,100
it is the end of the world, it is the end of the earth.

384
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,900
你需要舊約《以賽亞書》去明白《使徒行傳》

385
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,300
You need Isaiah to understand the book of Acts.

386
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:37,900
你更加明白《使徒》問復興以色列國的問題

387
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,700
So now you understand why the apostle asked the question

388
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,700
about restoration of the kingdom to Israel.

389
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,000
其實《以賽亞書》已經回答了

390
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,500
In fact, the book of Isaiah answers this question.

391
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,400
在舊約這個復興

392
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:00,000
當然是講亡國被老回歸重建的歷史

393
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Of course, we talk about restoration in the Old Testament

394
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,800
is about the decline of a nation and...

395
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,200
Coming back to Jerusalem?

396
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,800
Coming back to Jerusalem.

397
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,100
現在使徒已經在耶路撒冷了

398
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,600
And now the apostles are already in Jerusalem.

399
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,600
現在是羅馬帝國統治著他們

400
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,200
It's under the Roman Empire's rule.

401
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,200
所以甚麼叫做復興以色列國?

402
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,400
So what does it mean by restore the kingdom to Israel?

403
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:42,200
是憤慮黨西門的政綱

404
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,200
憤慮黨是甚麼人?

405
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,400
The Salads.

406
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,400
他們不是法利賽人

407
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
They are not Pharisees.

408
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,600
他們不是薩都該人

409
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,800
They are not...

410
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Satruses.

411
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
再加多一句

412
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,200
他們不是愛悉尼、死海古卷的Ascenes

413
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,000
They are not Ascenes.

414
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
他們是Salads, 憤慮黨的西門

415
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,200
They are the Simon of Salads.

416
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,200
耶穌揀選了一個憤慮黨人做他的使徒

417
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,000
Jesus chose a Salad to be his apostle.

418
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,800
教會的領袖

419
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,000
The leader of the church.

420
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,200
你說耶穌,你好揀唔揀?

421
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,200
你乜揀個勇武攬炒?

422
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Jesus, why do you choose this Salad to be your church leader?

423
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,400
耶穌成晚祈禱

424
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,600
Jesus prayed all night.

425
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,400
《路加福音》第六章

426
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,200
In Luke, chapter 6.

427
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,400
不單止揀了憤慮黨人西門

428
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,000
Not only Simon of the Salad.

429
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,800
他亦都揀了瑞利、馬太,有冇印象?

430
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,800
And also he chose the tax collector, Matthew.

431
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,600
唔考我哋嘅翻譯

432
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,200
喺古老嘅英文聖經嗰度翻譯

433
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,600
瑞利唔係譯做tax collector

434
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,000
係譯做republicans

435
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
In the scriptures, it is translated as republicans

436
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
instead of tax collectors.

437
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,200
然後馬太後日投票俾Trump

438
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,000
What do you say if Matthew vote for Trump?

439
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,600
Republic of Rome

440
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,600
羅馬共和國

441
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,000
Republic of Rome

442
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,400
馬太係支持帝國

443
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Matthew support the republic

444
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,400
所以佢先至做瑞利呢個行業

445
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,600
And that's why he become the republican.

446
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,600
所以你明白去到耶穌臨升天之前

447
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
啲使徒喺度拗乜嘢

448
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,800
So you know before Jesus ascend to heaven,

449
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,600
you know what the apostles were arguing.

450
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,000
佢哋唔係拗緊教會復興

451
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
They were not arguing for the restoration.

452
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,800
佢哋唔係拗緊耶穌幾時返嚟

453
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,200
Not about when Jesus coming back.

454
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
佢哋拗緊

455
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,200
憤慮黨同republican之間嘅政治立場

456
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,800
They are arguing for the political views

457
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,800
between the zealots and the republicans.

458
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,200
呢個喂

459
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
講嘅一班人

460
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
點傳福音呀

461
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,400
You may think all such group of people

462
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,800
how can they spread the gospel.

463
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,400
少郎主唔使寫落去啦

464
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,800
So we don't have to move on to the book of Acts.

465
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,200
第二章就撕裂

466
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,400
Chapter 2 was some fights between one another.

467
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,800
第三章就撕了

468
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,200
Chapter 3 is about...

469
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,400
你寫落去囉

470
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,000
我哋識寫架嗰個歷史係咪咁樣

471
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Do you think the history should be written like this?

472
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,600
聖經其實好現實嘅

473
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,000
Actually the scriptures is very related.

474
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,400
只要你肯讀

475
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Only if you are willing to read them.

476
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,000
唔係瞇埋眼就背一章第八節

477
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,600
Not just close your eyes and memorize the verse.

478
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,800
係耶穌講嘅

479
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
This is what Jesus said.

480
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,400
係聖經嘅記載嚟㗎

481
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,000
This is written in Exodus.

482
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,400
請問福音如何由耶路撒冷傳到猶太傳地和撒瑪利亞

483
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,000
How can the gospel go from Jerusalem to Judea and Samaria

484
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,800
and to the ends of the earth?

485
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,600
使徒開猜傳會議

486
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
The apostles held meetings.

487
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,000
十二個使徒

488
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,800
一半出去猜傳

489
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,800
一半留返喺樹木養

490
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,000
Among twelve apostles, half go out and spread the gospel

491
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and half remains in the church.

492
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
真係值得再讀一次使徒行傳

493
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's really worthy for us to read the books of Exodus.

494
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,200
你睜開咗隻眼已經

495
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,000
Now we open our eyes.

496
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
使徒行傳第八章第一節

497
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,800
In the book of Acts, chapter 8, verse 1.

498
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,000
你有冇iPhone呀?

499
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,200
我唔係問你有冇聖經呀

500
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,600
Whether you have the Bible app in your phone.

501
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,400
從這日起

502
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,400
耶路撒冷的教會大遭逼迫

503
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
除了使徒以外

504
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,400
門徒都分散在猶太和撒瑪利亞

505
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,200
On that day a great persecution broke out

506
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,600
against the church at Jerusalem

507
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,000
and all except the apostles were scattered

508
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
throughout Judea and Samaria.

509
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,400
第四節

510
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,200
Verse 4

511
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600
有iPhone嘅同學一齊讀

512
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,000
Please read with us.

513
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
那些分散的人往各處去傳道

514
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
Those who had been scattered

515
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,800
preached the word wherever they went.

516
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,000
睇到嗎?

517
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,800
Do you see?

518
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
聽見嗎?

519
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Do you hear?

520
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,000
嗰啲去咗倫敦 去咗溫哥華 去咗悉尼

521
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,200
去咗Toronto嘅人做乜嘢呀?

522
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Those who go to different cities around the world.

523
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,000
哦 佢哋去退休

524
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
What did they do?

525
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,600
哦 佢哋去避難

526
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,400
Retirement?

527
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,600
哦 佢哋同香港say 永別

528
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,400
They are saying goodbye to Hong Kong forever?

529
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
No.

530
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,000
No.

531
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
佢哋出去傳道

532
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,800
They are going to preach the word of God.

533
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:42,000
聖靈都唔使同教會討論 商量 表決

534
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,200
It is not required for the Holy Spirit to discuss with the church.

535
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,600
唔係過半數先至做㗎

536
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,000
Doesn't get the vote and the Holy Spirit get to decide.

537
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,800
一個唔該 逼北嚟到

538
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
And where the prosecution comes?

539
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,400
目的

540
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,600
And the purpose?

541
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,000
福音傳到地極

542
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,400
There is only one purpose for this.

543
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,400
It is to have the gospel to be sent to the end of the earth.

544
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,200
請問福音點樣從亞洲去到歐洲㗎?

545
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,400
Do you know how does the gospel goes from Asia to Europe?

546
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,400
哦 馬其頓嘅呼聲

547
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:29,000
Because of the Macedonian vision.

548
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,400
夜晚黑堡羅見到異象有馬其頓人話請過來幫助我門

549
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:43,400
At night Paul sees the vision that Macedonian called for help.

550
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
咁佢哋就過去歐洲囉

551
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,600
And so they go to Europe.

552
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
你再讀返前面一啲

553
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:58,000
If you refer to the back of front in the book of Acts.

554
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,800
保羅出去第二次傳到頭頭碰著黑

555
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,600
When Paul started preaching, he faces a lot of difficulties.

556
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,000
耶穌的靈不許 聖靈又禁止

557
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,600
有冇讀過呀?

558
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,200
The spirit of Jesus and the Holy Spirit

559
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,000
do not allow him to move forward.

560
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,600
保羅點解一個人出去咁淪盡呢?

561
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,600
You may say why Paul face such big difficulties?

562
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,800
係啦 因為佢冇同埋佢師父巴拿巴一起去

563
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,000
That's because he did not go with his mentor, Banabas.

564
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,400
點解佢冇同巴拿巴一起去?

565
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Why didn't he go with Banabas?

566
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
《士徒行傳》十五章記載

567
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,400
二人起了爭論 甚至彼此分開

568
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,200
In the book of Acts, chapter 15,

569
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,000
it mentions both of them argued and divided.

570
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,400
對唔住呀 陳牧師同曾牧師坐喺前面

571
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
借你哋做個例 得唔得?

572
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:09,000
May I use Reverend Zhang and Reverend Chan as an example?

573
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,400
曾牧師好緊張 摸下陳牧師個額

574
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Reverend Zhang is very nervous.

575
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,000
《士徒行傳》兩人起了爭論 甚至彼此分開

576
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,600
弟兄姊妹點算?

577
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,400
When the apostles start the argument and even divided between themselves,

578
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
what do you say?

579
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,200
安提柯教會冇分裂

580
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,800
The church of Antioch did not divide.

581
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,600
安提柯冇開始有間聖巴拿巴堂 冇間聖保羅堂

582
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,200
The church of Antioch did not start. The church of Banaba.

583
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,200
安提柯教會double 咗佢嘅mission budget

584
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:55,000
The mission budget in the church of Antioch was increased.

585
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,800
巴拿巴同馬可去居比路傳福音

586
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:05,200
Banaba and another person went to...

587
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Cyprus?

588
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Cyprus spread the gospel together.

589
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,800
保羅和西拉就聖靈又禁止 耶穌的靈又不許

590
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,200
原來是趕他們過去歐洲

591
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,200
When you see that the spirit of Jesus does not allow them to do so,

592
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,600
it forces them to go to another place.

593
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,400
嗌交唔好㗎 啱

594
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,800
It's not good to argue, that's correct.

595
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,800
撕裂唔得㗎 要和好 啱

596
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,200
Divide between one and another is not good. Better reconcile.

597
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,200
不過聖靈嘅工作出乎意料之外

598
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,600
But the work of the spirit is full of surprises.

599
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,200
請問福音係點樣帶到去羅馬㗎?

600
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,800
Do you know how did the gospel reach Rome?

601
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,000
保羅係點樣去羅馬㗎?

602
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,800
How did Paul go to Rome?

603
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,200
佢第三次傳道結束

604
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,200
During his third preaching mission.

605
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,800
佢趕返耶路撒冷首五巡節

606
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,800
He returns to Jerusalem for the Pentecost.

607
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,400
返到去之後

608
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,400
教會領袖約保羅來述職

609
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,000
After he reached Jerusalem,

610
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,200
the church leaders asked Paul to come.

611
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,800
邊個係耶路撒冷教會領袖呀?

612
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,200
Who is the leader of the church of Jerusalem?

613
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,600
瓦國 耶穌嘅弟弟

614
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,800
Jacob, Jesus' brother.

615
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,400
James.

616
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,200
就係瓦國書嗰個瓦國

617
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,600
James, from the book of James.

618
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,200
就係寫你哋唔係因信清義

619
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,400
係因行為清義嘅嗰個瓦國

620
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,800
James, the one who wrote about

621
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,400
you are not justified by faith, but justified by work.

622
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,600
而家瓦國同保羅見面啦

623
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,000
Now, James is meeting with Paul.

624
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,600
保羅同瓦國講

625
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,400
「愛邦人信主」

626
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,200
點樣 點樣 點樣 感謝讚美神

627
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,000
Now, Paul said to James,

628
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,400
the Gentiles hear the gospel

629
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,200
and it was amazing and everything.

630
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,000
瓦國話俾保羅聽

631
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
「輕台」

632
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,200
James said to Paul,

633
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
「Big brother」

634
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
你知道喺耶路撒冷

635
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,600
信奉者道嘅猶太人

636
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,000
成千上萬

637
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,600
並且熱心法律

638
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,000
Do you know that the people in Judea

639
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,400
follow the words of God

640
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,600
and they follow the law?

641
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,200
並且佢哋話你保羅

642
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,000
唔守摩西嘅律法

643
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,400
And they said, you Paul,

644
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,000
you did not follow the laws of Moses.

645
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,400
唔俾下一代守國禮

646
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,200
You do not allow the next generation

647
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
to have circumcision.

648
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,800
咁點算呀?

649
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,400
What to do?

650
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,000
嗱 不如咁啦

651
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,800
How about this?

652
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,600
唔係我作嘅

653
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
係少林寺記載嘅

654
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,400
I didn't make this all up.

655
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,000
It was written in the scriptures.

656
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,400
二十章

657
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,800
記唔記得呀?

658
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,600
Chapter 20.

659
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,200
我哋冇時間讀啦

660
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,400
Do you remember?

661
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,600
But we don't have time to go through that.

662
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,200
雅各同保羅講

663
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,400
你不如上聖殿去還願

664
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,800
俾人睇下你係

665
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,600
循規蹈矩嘅一個人

666
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,400
James said to Paul,

667
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,800
how about you go to the temple

668
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,200
and show people that you follow the laws?

669
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,600
呢四個字

670
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,800
你係保羅

671
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,600
你冚唔冚得落呀?

672
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,000
Imagine you are Paul.

673
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,600
Can you take that?

674
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,200
保羅妥協

675
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,800
Paul agrees.

676
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,000
Compromised.

677
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,800
忘記初衷

678
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:08,000
He forgot his first calling.

679
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,800
保羅願意咁樣做

680
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,400
Paul is willing to do so.

681
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,600
結果聖殿暴動

682
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,400
And there was a disruption in the temple.

683
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,000
唔止呀

684
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,200
七個人無罪釋放嗰隻呢

685
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,600
And release of the seven persons.

686
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,200
係咪?

687
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,800
跟住就上訴該殺

688
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,800
And they make their appeal to Kaiser.

689
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,200
所以保羅係坐住business class

690
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,000
去羅馬公堂送佢去

691
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,800
And therefore Paul is sitting on the first class of the plane to go to Rome.

692
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,800
但聖靈降臨

693
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,400
But the Holy Spirit descends.

694
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,600
你要等候聖靈嘅工作

695
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,200
You have to wait for the work of the Holy Spirit.

696
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,400
完全唔係我哋嘅計劃嚟㗎

697
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,400
It's completely not what we think about.

698
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,400
唔係教會生生性性㗎

699
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,400
It's not about the church behaving according to the laws and the teachings.

700
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,000
係睇環境真係皺哂眉頭㗎

701
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,800
If you look at the surroundings, you get the frustrations.

702
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:28,400
又逼白又撕裂又爭吵又神學不同

703
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,800
乜嘢都齊晒

704
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:36,200
There were persecution, divisions, arguments and differences in theology and thinking.

705
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,200
但福音就係咁樣直到地極

706
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,400
And that is how the gospel goes to the ends of the world.

707
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,600
同頭一天開始

708
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,000
It was started from the beginning of...

709
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,600
直到今天2020年11月1日香港感受宣導會

710
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:03,800
Until today, November 1st of 2020 at this church.

711
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,600
我哋聽到神嘅道

712
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,400
We hear God's word.

713
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,000
如果係長老會嘅傳統

714
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,600
我哋應該一齊回應

715
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,800
Thanks be to God.

716
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,600
If it is in the perspiration traditions, we should all say, "Thanks be to God."

717
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,000
感謝主

718
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,200
Thank you, God.

719
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,400
感謝主

720
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,600
Thank you, God.

721
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,200
多謝我哋嘅翻譯

722
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Thank you for your message.

723
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,200
多謝您收睇時局新聞,再會!
