[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]  各位親愛的弟兄姊妹,主內平安
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.400]  Dear all brothers and sisters, shalom
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.900]  讓我先祝賀錦宣家三十九歲生日快樂
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.900]  May I first send my greetings and wishes to
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.400]  Farewell Park Alliance Church for this 39th anniversary
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.600]  Happy birthday
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.900]  今日我們選擇的經文是
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:46.000]  大家好熟悉《史道行傳》一章開始的記載
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.500]  Today we are going to look at the book of Acts chapter 1
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.600]  The beginning of this book
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.400]  你說我都識背了,還有什麼好說的?
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.500]  Or maybe you would say I know this verse as well, what to talk about?
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.900]  我連耶路撒冷、猶太傳、地撒瑪利亞直到地極都背得準確
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.100]  I can memorize the verse in Jerusalem, in all Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.200]  好,你不要看聖經,回答我下面這個問題
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.000]  Ok, now, please do not refer to the Bible and answer me this question
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.100]  耶穌在一章八節講聖靈是第幾次講到聖靈?
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.600]  When Jesus talked about the Holy Spirit in verse 8
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.100]  How many times did He talk about this?
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.000]  從第一節開始,耶穌講了多少次聖靈?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.700]  Ever since verse 1, how many times did He mention about the Holy Spirit?
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.700]  不知道啊,who cares?
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.800]  I don't know, who cares?
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.900]  要知的
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.300]  You have to know
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.600]  你看看聖經
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.100]  Refer to the Scriptures
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.700]  耶穌在第二節提到聖靈
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.500]  藉著聖靈來吩咐使徒
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.000]  In verse 2, He said
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.500]  After giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the Apostle He had chosen
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.800]  這是教導我們三一真神彼此的關係
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.900]  This is about the relationship between the triune God
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.500]  第五節,第二次講到聖靈
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.800]  In verse 5, this is the second time that the Holy Spirit is mentioned
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.100]  這裡講聖靈的洗
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.500]  It mentions baptized with the Holy Spirit
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.100]  就是講《舍行傳》第二章發生的事情
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.400]  This is about chapter 2 in the book of Acts
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.300]  所以我們不要隨便想像什麼叫做聖靈的施洗
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.900]  Please do not just think about what is baptized with the Holy Spirit by your own mind
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.700]  其實來到第八節
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.900]  這就是第三次講聖靈降臨
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.200]  And in verse 8, it should be the third time
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.900]  that the Scripture mentions about the Holy Spirit
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.700]  不要用check room來投票
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.500]  唯有不用你舉手
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.700]  你告訴我這樣的答案對不對?
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.500]  Do you think this answer is correct?
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.400]  不對
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400]  No, it's not
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.600]  因為你漏了最重要的那次
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.500]  Because you have missed out the most important time
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.000]  沒有啦,我看到是三次講聖靈的
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.800]  Well, I did not see the fourth time
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.200]  第六節
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.500]  Verse 6
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.500]  他們聚集的時候
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.500]  Then they gathered around him
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.500]  為什麼他們要聚集呢?
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.300]  Why do they have to gather?
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.300]  第四節說
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.800]  耶穌和使徒聚集的時候
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.000]  Verse 4 said
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.500]  When Jesus gathered with the apostles
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.000]  耶穌祝福他們說
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.200]  Jesus gave them this command
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.800]  不要離開耶路撒冷
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.600]  Do not leave Jerusalem
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.200]  要等候父所應許的
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.600]  But wait for the gift my Father promised
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.900]  等什麼?
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.700]  What to wait for
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.700]  等誰?
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.800]  Who to wait for
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.800]  誰是父所應許的
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.200]  Who is the Father promised
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.800]  聖靈
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.900]  The gift, the Holy Spirit
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.800]  所以這段經文最重要的那句講聖靈
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.400]  是故意不講的
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.500]  That's why the most important part
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.400]  that talks about the Holy Spirit
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.800]  it was not mentioned
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.800]  英文我們叫做loud silence
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.400]  有沒有聽過?
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.500]  In English, it's called loud silence
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.800]  不講就是最重要那句
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.200]  If you don't talk about it
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.800]  it is the most important
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.200]  因為這是耶穌的祝福
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.800]  Because this is Jesus' command
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.200]  這是他們聚集的原因
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.100]  This is the reason why they gathered
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.800]  這是父神所應許
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.500]  This is what the Father promised
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.200]  這也是主耶穌曾經跟使徒說過的
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.500]  他們聽過的
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.200]  And this is what Jesus had told the apostles about
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.000]  所以我們的印象就是
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.200]  耶穌叫他們來就送他們去
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.000]  So we always have this impression
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.400]  that Jesus comes and sends the disciples
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.200]  馬太福音、馬學福音是這樣說的
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.100]  In the book of Matthew and Mark, it said so
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.600]  你又會背了
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.100]  I know you can memorize that
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.700]  所以你們要去
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.000]  Therefore you go
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]  使萬民作我的門徒
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.800]  Make disciples
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.100]  你們往普天下去
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.100]  傳福音給萬民聽
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.500]  Go to the world and preach the gospels
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.700]  我們沒有時間了
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.200]  We don't have enough time
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.200]  曾牧師給我三十分鐘
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.200]  還要扣上全譯
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.300]  Pastor John gave me a limited time
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.900]  你回去看《路加福音》二十四章
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.200]  You can refer to the book of Luke, chapter 24
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.600]  四十六節到五十二節
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.900]  很長的
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.400]  Verse 46 to 52
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.300]  It's a long passage
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.600]  耶穌祝福他們
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.300]  不要離開耶路撒冷
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.500]  Jesus gave them the command
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.900]  Do not leave Jerusalem
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.000]  要等候父所應許的
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.500]  But wait for the gift my father promised
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.300]  你衝了出去
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.100]  就留了最重要的東西
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.400]  If you just go with your own will
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.500]  and you left the gift behind
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.500]  所以不要這麼快
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.500]  Don't rush
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.500]  去之前
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.500]  Before you go
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.700]  要等候
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.800]  There's a wait
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.100]  等誰?
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.300]  Who to wait to?
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.800]  不是等法叔
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.300]  是等候聖靈
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.900]  It's waiting for the Holy Spirit
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.600]  這些不能翻譯的
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.900]  對不起
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:21.100]  但是《史道行傳》比《路加福音》更詳細
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.500]  The book of Acts
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.100]  describing these in more details
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.300]  因為他們聚集的時候
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.700]  耶穌祝福他們等候聖靈
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.400]  Jesus gave his command to them
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.300]  that they have to wait for the Holy Spirit
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.400]  到主耶穌最後一次提聖靈降臨這句說話
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.400]  When Jesus mentioned
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.100]  the Holy Spirit descending to them
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.000]  其實前面還有一個連接詞
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.300]  conjunction
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.600]  In fact, there is a conjunction
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.400]  before everything he said
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.800]  那個不是一個普通的
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.800]  and or but
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.200]  這麼簡單的連接詞
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.800]  It is not just a conjunction
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.200]  like and or but
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.400]  希臘文alaa
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.500]  這個是一個很強調的連接詞
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.800]  In Hebrew, it says alaa
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.800]  但聖靈降臨
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.600]  But the Holy Spirit descends
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.200]  可能英文要說however
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.300]  In English, we may say however
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.400]  加重語氣
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.300]  emphasize it, however
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.400]  前面說什麼
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.100]  What was before that
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.200]  為什麼後面要加個但字開始
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.300]  Why did the word however was mentioned in the scriptures
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.900]  因為我從來讀聖經都不讀這些
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.200]  You may say, oh, I don't know
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.100]  I never realized
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.800]  我讀聖經就是問有什麼教訓
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.800]  我衝出去做
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.800]  I believe the scriptures tell me what to do
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.000]  and I just go and do it
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.400]  先聽清楚耶穌說什麼
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.800]  Please listen carefully to what Jesus said
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.200]  第一,他叫我們等候聖靈
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.100]  First, to wait for the Holy Spirit
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.100]  第二,他提到聖靈之前
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.600]  他有個連接詞說
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.000]  但聖靈降臨
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]  before waiting for the Holy Spirit
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]  there is a conjunction, but
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.600]  上半句耶穌是在回答使徒的問題
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.800]  In the first part, he was answering the apostles' questions
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.800]  上半節和下半節
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.600]  哪半節重要些
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.300]  What Jesus said is more important
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.200]  the upper verse or the lower verse
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.600]  當然是下半節聖靈降臨
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.100]  You may say, oh, of course
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.500]  those things that he said later
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.100]  你明不明白我們的問題出在哪裡
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.600]  Do you know the problem
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.200]  我們讀聖經很霸道
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.800]  When we read the scriptures, we are very
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.100]  耶穌明明說了上下兩半
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.300]  我們截了上一半
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.300]  我們只說下一半最重要
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.800]  Jesus mentioned two things
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.600]  and we just pick one only
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.300]  行不行呢
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.400]  Do you think that's okay?
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.000]  耶穌回答使徒什麼問題呢
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.400]  What did Jesus answer to the disciples?
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.900]  主啊,我讀的是和合本
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.200]  祢復興以色列國
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.200]  就在這時候嗎
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.200]  Lord, are you at this time
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.200]  going to restore the kingdom to Israel?
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.900]  復興
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.200]  Restoration
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.800]  你說這個是很屬靈的
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.800]  我們要教會復興
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.200]  We would like the church to be restored
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.700]  三十九年的歷史
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.300]  前面的三十九年
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.600]  我們祈求復興
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.900]  感謝讚美主
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.800]  We have 39 years of history
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.500]  and we look forward to this restoration
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.000]  對不起
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.600]  這裡不是在說復興教會
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.300]  I'm sorry
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.400]  This is not about restoration of the church
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.700]  我們一見到復興兩個字
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.500]  就跳進了我們的結論裡
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.700]  不可以的
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.700]  When we look at the word "restore"
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.400]  we just conclude the verse is about restoration
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.200]  and it's not correct
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.200]  復興誰
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.100]  Who to be restored
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.700]  復興以色列
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.500]  Restore Israel?
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.100]  不是
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.100]  復興以色列國
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.900]  Restore the kingdom of Israel
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.900]  懂得聽這句話嗎
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.600]  Do you understand this verse?
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.800]  在羅馬帝國統治之下
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.600]  Under the Roman Empire
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.100]  試圖問這個問題要很小心
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.200]  When the apostles ask this question
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.500]  they have to be extra careful
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:09.600]  沒有23條有國安法
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.300]  We don't have a law 23
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.600]  but we have national security law
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.800]  明白《使徒行傳》第一章嗎
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.500]  Do you understand this?
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.000]  明白了
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.200]  醒了
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.400]  Do you understand?
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.800]  試圖問的是一個政治的問題
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.300]  What the apostles were asking
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.600]  were the political questions
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.400]  耶穌如何回答這個政治的問題呢
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.400]  How did Jesus answer this political question?
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.100]  上半重要還是下半重要呢
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:47.000]  Is the upper part more important or the lower part more important?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.700]  看你什麼顏色
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.200]  Depends on your colour
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.800]  不是這樣讀聖經的
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.600]  No, it's not the way we read the scriptures
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.600]  耶穌的答案
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.200]  Jesus' answer
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.400]  我們真的要小心聽
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.000]  We have to listen carefully
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.200]  因為他的答案其實是背著舊約聖經的金句
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:13.600]  Because his answer refers to the Old Testament
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.100]  如果我們不懂的話
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.000]  我們很容易誤會了耶穌的意思
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.700]  If we don't fully understand
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.100]  we might misunderstand Jesus' teaching
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.800]  起初神創造天地
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.000]  你知道我背著創世記一章一節
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.200]  In the beginning
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.700]  God created the heaven and the earth
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.300]  That was in Genesis 1:1
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.100]  耶和華是我的目者
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.200]  你知道我背著四篇二十三篇
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.000]  The Lord is my shepherd from Psalm 23
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]  You all know that
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.700]  我的神
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.300]  為什麼離棄我
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.600]  My God, why do you abandon me?
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.100]  你知道耶穌背著哪一章聖經嗎
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.100]  Do you know which verse Jesus refers to?
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.200]  啊!耶穌好痛苦在十字架上大叫救命啊
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.300]  錯了
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.500]  Oh, Jesus, when he was crucified on the cross
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.300]  He was in such pain that he screamed
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.300]  耶穌不是痛苦叫救命啊
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.600]  No, Jesus is not screaming because of the pain
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.500]  我只看到你的眼睛
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.000]  我看不到你的樣子
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]  戴了口罩
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]  不過我看到你好像不知道我在說什麼
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.200]  From where I stand, I can see your eyes
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.200]  And I guess you are wondering what I'm talking about
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.300]  耶穌是背著四篇二十二篇第一節
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:42.200]  Jesus was referring to Psalm 22, verse 1
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.100]  四篇二十二篇全篇所說的主題
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.100]  正正就是上帝從來都沒有離開過
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.600]  In Psalm 22, the passage was about
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.300]  God has never left us
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:04.400]  環境看來,我們會問上帝往哪裡去了?
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.000]  When we look around, we may ask where did God go?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.300]  但是Cp 22篇正正就是說不要看周圍
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:18.000]  But Psalm 22 teaches us not to look around our surroundings
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  所以你不知道耶穌背著這句
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.900]  你就解錯了他的意思
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:26.000]  If you do not know that Jesus was referring to the Old Testament
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.200]  you might have got the wrong meaning
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.200]  拿著雞毛當靈箭
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.400]  You have another idea
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.400]  不可以的
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.400]  No, that's not right
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.700]  請問耶穌在這裡背著哪一節金句?
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.600]  Which verse is Jesus referring to?
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.000]  以塞俠書49章第6節
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.700]  It is from Isaiah 49, verse 6
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.600]  沒有印出來給大家
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.400]  I did not print it out for you guys
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.500]  你有iPhone請你點擊以塞俠書49章第6節
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.900]  If you have your phone
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:10.200]  please turn to Isaiah 49, verse 6
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.600]  我讀給大家聽
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.600]  Let me read it for you
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:34.800]  「現在他說:你作我的僕人,使雅各眾之派復興,使以色列中德保存的歸回尚為小事。」
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:42.400]  He said, "It is too small a thing for you to be my servant
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.100]  to restore the tribes of Jacob
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.200]  and bring back those of Israel I have kept."
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:17:01.000]  「我還要使你作外邦人的光,叫你施行我的救恩,直到地極。」
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.800]  「I will also make you a light for the Gentiles,
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.200]  that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth.」
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.500]  看到耶穌引用的這句金句嗎?
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.400]  Now you see which verse does Jesus refer to?
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.400]  那你才明白什麼叫做「直到地極」
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.300]  Then only then you understand what does it mean by the ends of the earth.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:30.100]  《使徒行傳》28章保羅去到地極了嗎?
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:35.000]  In the book of Acts 28, does Paul reach the ends of the earth?
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.800]  你一定是另投說「未」
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.600]  I am sure you will say no.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.700]  都未去到南極、北極
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.900]  It never reached Antarctica and the Arctic.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.200]  那裡只有北極熊和企鵝
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.300]  No, there is only polar bears and penguins.
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:56.800]  那你起碼要來中國、印度、四大文明古國
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.500]  At least you have to come to China.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.900]  不是
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:07.600]  《以賽亞書》49章第6節很清楚說
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.800]  It is clearly said in this verse
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:20.500]  「地極」和「外邦」是平衡的同義詞
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:26.500]  The meaning of the ends of the earth and the Gentiles are parallel in meaning.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:31.200]  所以《路加福音》24章如果你回去真的看一看
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.500]  你就會發覺那裡不是說地極
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.100]  那裡是說「萬邦」
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.600]  If you look at Luke 24
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.500]  It was not talking about the ends of the earth
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.800]  but it is about all nations.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.200]  保羅去到地極了
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.200]  Paul reached the ends of the earth.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.700]  因為條條大道通羅馬
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.200]  Because all routes go through Rome.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.900]  羅馬就是外邦世界的中心
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.900]  Rome is the center of the Gentiles' world.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:12.900]  所以《使徒行傳》28章停在羅馬是地極
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:18.100]  Therefore when the book of Acts stops at Rome
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.100]  it is the end of the world, it is the end of the earth.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.900]  你需要舊約《以賽亞書》去明白《使徒行傳》
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.300]  You need Isaiah to understand the book of Acts.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:37.900]  你更加明白《使徒》問復興以色列國的問題
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.700]  So now you understand why the apostle asked the question
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.700]  about restoration of the kingdom to Israel.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.000]  其實《以賽亞書》已經回答了
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.500]  In fact, the book of Isaiah answers this question.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.400]  在舊約這個復興
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:20:00.000]  當然是講亡國被老回歸重建的歷史
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]  Of course, we talk about restoration in the Old Testament
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.800]  is about the decline of a nation and...
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.200]  Coming back to Jerusalem?
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.800]  Coming back to Jerusalem.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.100]  現在使徒已經在耶路撒冷了
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.600]  And now the apostles are already in Jerusalem.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.600]  現在是羅馬帝國統治著他們
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.200]  It's under the Roman Empire's rule.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.200]  所以甚麼叫做復興以色列國?
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.400]  So what does it mean by restore the kingdom to Israel?
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:42.200]  是憤慮黨西門的政綱
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.200]  憤慮黨是甚麼人?
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.400]  The Salads.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.400]  他們不是法利賽人
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.400]  They are not Pharisees.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.600]  他們不是薩都該人
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.800]  They are not...
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.800]  Satruses.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.800]  再加多一句
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.200]  他們不是愛悉尼、死海古卷的Ascenes
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.000]  They are not Ascenes.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]  他們是Salads, 憤慮黨的西門
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.200]  They are the Simon of Salads.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:20.200]  耶穌揀選了一個憤慮黨人做他的使徒
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:26.000]  Jesus chose a Salad to be his apostle.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.800]  教會的領袖
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.000]  The leader of the church.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.200]  你說耶穌,你好揀唔揀?
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.200]  你乜揀個勇武攬炒?
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:41.200]  Jesus, why do you choose this Salad to be your church leader?
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.400]  耶穌成晚祈禱
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.600]  Jesus prayed all night.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.400]  《路加福音》第六章
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.200]  In Luke, chapter 6.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.400]  不單止揀了憤慮黨人西門
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.000]  Not only Simon of the Salad.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.800]  他亦都揀了瑞利、馬太,有冇印象?
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.800]  And also he chose the tax collector, Matthew.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.600]  唔考我哋嘅翻譯
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.200]  喺古老嘅英文聖經嗰度翻譯
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.600]  瑞利唔係譯做tax collector
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.000]  係譯做republicans
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]  In the scriptures, it is translated as republicans
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.600]  instead of tax collectors.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.200]  然後馬太後日投票俾Trump
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.000]  What do you say if Matthew vote for Trump?
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.600]  Republic of Rome
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.600]  羅馬共和國
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.000]  Republic of Rome
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.400]  馬太係支持帝國
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.400]  Matthew support the republic
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.400]  所以佢先至做瑞利呢個行業
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.600]  And that's why he become the republican.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.600]  所以你明白去到耶穌臨升天之前
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.600]  啲使徒喺度拗乜嘢
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.800]  So you know before Jesus ascend to heaven,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.600]  you know what the apostles were arguing.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.000]  佢哋唔係拗緊教會復興
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.600]  They were not arguing for the restoration.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.800]  佢哋唔係拗緊耶穌幾時返嚟
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.200]  Not about when Jesus coming back.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.200]  佢哋拗緊
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:20.200]  憤慮黨同republican之間嘅政治立場
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.800]  They are arguing for the political views
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.800]  between the zealots and the republicans.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.200]  呢個喂
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.200]  講嘅一班人
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.200]  點傳福音呀
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.400]  You may think all such group of people
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.800]  how can they spread the gospel.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.400]  少郎主唔使寫落去啦
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.800]  So we don't have to move on to the book of Acts.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.200]  第二章就撕裂
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.400]  Chapter 2 was some fights between one another.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.800]  第三章就撕了
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.200]  Chapter 3 is about...
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.400]  你寫落去囉
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.000]  我哋識寫架嗰個歷史係咪咁樣
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]  Do you think the history should be written like this?
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.600]  聖經其實好現實嘅
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.000]  Actually the scriptures is very related.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.400]  只要你肯讀
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.400]  Only if you are willing to read them.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.000]  唔係瞇埋眼就背一章第八節
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.600]  Not just close your eyes and memorize the verse.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.800]  係耶穌講嘅
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.800]  This is what Jesus said.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.400]  係聖經嘅記載嚟㗎
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.000]  This is written in Exodus.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.400]  請問福音如何由耶路撒冷傳到猶太傳地和撒瑪利亞
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.000]  How can the gospel go from Jerusalem to Judea and Samaria
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.800]  and to the ends of the earth?
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.600]  使徒開猜傳會議
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.600]  The apostles held meetings.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.000]  十二個使徒
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.800]  一半出去猜傳
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.800]  一半留返喺樹木養
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:55.000]  Among twelve apostles, half go out and spread the gospel
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]  and half remains in the church.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]  真係值得再讀一次使徒行傳
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]  It's really worthy for us to read the books of Exodus.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.200]  你睜開咗隻眼已經
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.000]  Now we open our eyes.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:15.000]  使徒行傳第八章第一節
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.800]  In the book of Acts, chapter 8, verse 1.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.000]  你有冇iPhone呀?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.200]  我唔係問你有冇聖經呀
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.600]  Whether you have the Bible app in your phone.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.400]  從這日起
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.400]  耶路撒冷的教會大遭逼迫
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.400]  除了使徒以外
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:38.400]  門徒都分散在猶太和撒瑪利亞
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.200]  On that day a great persecution broke out
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.600]  against the church at Jerusalem
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.000]  and all except the apostles were scattered
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]  throughout Judea and Samaria.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.400]  第四節
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.200]  Verse 4
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.600]  有iPhone嘅同學一齊讀
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.000]  Please read with us.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000]  那些分散的人往各處去傳道
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.600]  Those who had been scattered
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.800]  preached the word wherever they went.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.000]  睇到嗎?
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.800]  Do you see?
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.800]  聽見嗎?
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.800]  Do you hear?
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.000]  嗰啲去咗倫敦 去咗溫哥華 去咗悉尼
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.200]  去咗Toronto嘅人做乜嘢呀?
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.200]  Those who go to different cities around the world.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.000]  哦 佢哋去退休
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]  What did they do?
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.600]  哦 佢哋去避難
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.400]  Retirement?
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.600]  哦 佢哋同香港say 永別
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.400]  They are saying goodbye to Hong Kong forever?
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.400]  No.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.000]  No.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]  佢哋出去傳道
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.800]  They are going to preach the word of God.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:42.000]  聖靈都唔使同教會討論 商量 表決
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.200]  It is not required for the Holy Spirit to discuss with the church.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.600]  唔係過半數先至做㗎
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:54.000]  Doesn't get the vote and the Holy Spirit get to decide.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.800]  一個唔該 逼北嚟到
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.800]  And where the prosecution comes?
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.400]  目的
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.600]  And the purpose?
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.000]  福音傳到地極
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.400]  There is only one purpose for this.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:12.400]  It is to have the gospel to be sent to the end of the earth.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.200]  請問福音點樣從亞洲去到歐洲㗎?
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.400]  Do you know how does the gospel goes from Asia to Europe?
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.400]  哦 馬其頓嘅呼聲
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:29.000]  Because of the Macedonian vision.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.400]  夜晚黑堡羅見到異象有馬其頓人話請過來幫助我門
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:43.400]  At night Paul sees the vision that Macedonian called for help.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.400]  咁佢哋就過去歐洲囉
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.600]  And so they go to Europe.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.600]  你再讀返前面一啲
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:58.000]  If you refer to the back of front in the book of Acts.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.800]  保羅出去第二次傳到頭頭碰著黑
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:08.600]  When Paul started preaching, he faces a lot of difficulties.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.000]  耶穌的靈不許 聖靈又禁止
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.600]  有冇讀過呀?
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.200]  The spirit of Jesus and the Holy Spirit
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.000]  do not allow him to move forward.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.600]  保羅點解一個人出去咁淪盡呢?
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.600]  You may say why Paul face such big difficulties?
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.800]  係啦 因為佢冇同埋佢師父巴拿巴一起去
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:39.000]  That's because he did not go with his mentor, Banabas.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.400]  點解佢冇同巴拿巴一起去?
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.400]  Why didn't he go with Banabas?
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.400]  《士徒行傳》十五章記載
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.400]  二人起了爭論 甚至彼此分開
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.200]  In the book of Acts, chapter 15,
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:59.000]  it mentions both of them argued and divided.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.400]  對唔住呀 陳牧師同曾牧師坐喺前面
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.400]  借你哋做個例 得唔得?
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:09.000]  May I use Reverend Zhang and Reverend Chan as an example?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.400]  曾牧師好緊張 摸下陳牧師個額
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.400]  Reverend Zhang is very nervous.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:20.000]  《士徒行傳》兩人起了爭論 甚至彼此分開
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.600]  弟兄姊妹點算?
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.400]  When the apostles start the argument and even divided between themselves,
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.400]  what do you say?
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.200]  安提柯教會冇分裂
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.800]  The church of Antioch did not divide.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.600]  安提柯冇開始有間聖巴拿巴堂 冇間聖保羅堂
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:43.200]  The church of Antioch did not start. The church of Banaba.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.200]  安提柯教會double 咗佢嘅mission budget
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:55.000]  The mission budget in the church of Antioch was increased.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.800]  巴拿巴同馬可去居比路傳福音
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:05.200]  Banaba and another person went to...
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.200]  Cyprus?
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.200]  Cyprus spread the gospel together.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:16.800]  保羅和西拉就聖靈又禁止 耶穌的靈又不許
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.200]  原來是趕他們過去歐洲
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.200]  When you see that the spirit of Jesus does not allow them to do so,
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.600]  it forces them to go to another place.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.400]  嗌交唔好㗎 啱
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.800]  It's not good to argue, that's correct.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.800]  撕裂唔得㗎 要和好 啱
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.200]  Divide between one and another is not good. Better reconcile.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.200]  不過聖靈嘅工作出乎意料之外
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.600]  But the work of the spirit is full of surprises.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.200]  請問福音係點樣帶到去羅馬㗎?
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.800]  Do you know how did the gospel reach Rome?
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.000]  保羅係點樣去羅馬㗎?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.800]  How did Paul go to Rome?
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.200]  佢第三次傳道結束
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.200]  During his third preaching mission.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.800]  佢趕返耶路撒冷首五巡節
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.800]  He returns to Jerusalem for the Pentecost.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.400]  返到去之後
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.400]  教會領袖約保羅來述職
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.000]  After he reached Jerusalem,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.200]  the church leaders asked Paul to come.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.800]  邊個係耶路撒冷教會領袖呀?
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:37.200]  Who is the leader of the church of Jerusalem?
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.600]  瓦國 耶穌嘅弟弟
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.800]  Jacob, Jesus' brother.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.400]  James.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.200]  就係瓦國書嗰個瓦國
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.600]  James, from the book of James.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.200]  就係寫你哋唔係因信清義
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.400]  係因行為清義嘅嗰個瓦國
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.800]  James, the one who wrote about
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.400]  you are not justified by faith, but justified by work.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.600]  而家瓦國同保羅見面啦
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.000]  Now, James is meeting with Paul.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.600]  保羅同瓦國講
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.400]  「愛邦人信主」
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.200]  點樣 點樣 點樣 感謝讚美神
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.000]  Now, Paul said to James,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.400]  the Gentiles hear the gospel
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.200]  and it was amazing and everything.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.000]  瓦國話俾保羅聽
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]  「輕台」
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.200]  James said to Paul,
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.200]  「Big brother」
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.200]  你知道喺耶路撒冷
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.600]  信奉者道嘅猶太人
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.000]  成千上萬
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.600]  並且熱心法律
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.000]  Do you know that the people in Judea
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.400]  follow the words of God
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.600]  and they follow the law?
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.200]  並且佢哋話你保羅
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.000]  唔守摩西嘅律法
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.400]  And they said, you Paul,
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.000]  you did not follow the laws of Moses.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.400]  唔俾下一代守國禮
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.200]  You do not allow the next generation
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.200]  to have circumcision.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.800]  咁點算呀?
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.400]  What to do?
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.000]  嗱 不如咁啦
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.800]  How about this?
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.600]  唔係我作嘅
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.200]  係少林寺記載嘅
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.400]  I didn't make this all up.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.000]  It was written in the scriptures.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.400]  二十章
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.800]  記唔記得呀?
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.600]  Chapter 20.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.200]  我哋冇時間讀啦
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.400]  Do you remember?
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.600]  But we don't have time to go through that.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.200]  雅各同保羅講
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.400]  你不如上聖殿去還願
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.800]  俾人睇下你係
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:40.600]  循規蹈矩嘅一個人
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.400]  James said to Paul,
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.800]  how about you go to the temple
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.200]  and show people that you follow the laws?
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.600]  呢四個字
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.800]  你係保羅
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.600]  你冚唔冚得落呀?
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.000]  Imagine you are Paul.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.600]  Can you take that?
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.200]  保羅妥協
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.800]  Paul agrees.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.000]  Compromised.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.800]  忘記初衷
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:08.000]  He forgot his first calling.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.800]  保羅願意咁樣做
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.400]  Paul is willing to do so.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.600]  結果聖殿暴動
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.400]  And there was a disruption in the temple.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.000]  唔止呀
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.200]  七個人無罪釋放嗰隻呢
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.600]  And release of the seven persons.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.200]  係咪?
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.800]  跟住就上訴該殺
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.800]  And they make their appeal to Kaiser.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:37.200]  所以保羅係坐住business class
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.000]  去羅馬公堂送佢去
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.800]  And therefore Paul is sitting on the first class of the plane to go to Rome.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.800]  但聖靈降臨
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.400]  But the Holy Spirit descends.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.600]  你要等候聖靈嘅工作
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.200]  You have to wait for the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.400]  完全唔係我哋嘅計劃嚟㗎
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.400]  It's completely not what we think about.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.400]  唔係教會生生性性㗎
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:14.400]  It's not about the church behaving according to the laws and the teachings.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.000]  係睇環境真係皺哂眉頭㗎
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.800]  If you look at the surroundings, you get the frustrations.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:28.400]  又逼白又撕裂又爭吵又神學不同
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.800]  乜嘢都齊晒
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:36.200]  There were persecution, divisions, arguments and differences in theology and thinking.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.200]  但福音就係咁樣直到地極
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.400]  And that is how the gospel goes to the ends of the world.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.600]  同頭一天開始
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.000]  It was started from the beginning of...
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:56.600]  直到今天2020年11月1日香港感受宣導會
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:03.800]  Until today, November 1st of 2020 at this church.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.600]  我哋聽到神嘅道
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.400]  We hear God's word.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.000]  如果係長老會嘅傳統
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.600]  我哋應該一齊回應
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.800]  Thanks be to God.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:19.600]  If it is in the perspiration traditions, we should all say, "Thanks be to God."
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.000]  感謝主
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.200]  Thank you, God.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.400]  感謝主
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.600]  Thank you, God.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.200]  多謝我哋嘅翻譯
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.200]  Thank you for your message.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.200]  多謝您收睇時局新聞,再會!
