If he would love me, it would be easier for him to sacrifice than his Christian friend.。
I think so. It's true.。
Let's see if people would love you.。
I think I am okay.。
Okay, now I know that many of our Darling sisters would like to know what we, the Wooden Knight, usually talk about.。
We are going to tell you now.。
Today is the first episode of "Wooden Knight Talks".。
I am so nervous.。
I am also nervous.。
We are going to talk about nonsense.。
We are going to talk about nonsense.。
Although there is some meaning in our nonsense.。
There should be some meaning.。
I just said some professional terms.。
I don't know what it is.。
But many people would like to know what we usually talk about.。
So we have this program.。
Let's listen to it.。
I want to ask if you have watched the episode of "The King and the Queen"?。
Have you watched it?。
I am not going to say it. Have you watched it?。
Of course, I have.。
Sometimes there is an event like this.。
You don't say it.。
I have seen that there are many condoms in the ruins.。
So I don't think it is as simple as "free hug, free kiss".。
What did you see? You saw people in the ruins.。
I saw people in the ruins.。
I didn't see anything.。
Why don't you brief me what you saw?。
You didn't see anything?。
You are kidding.。
You should go back and watch it.。
I don't remember.。
I watched a YouTuber.。
I am not going to advertise for him.。
He spent half an hour on this video.。
He went to Kwan Bin when the ruins were being demolished.。
Many girls and boys were sitting there.。
He said that he could see "free kiss" and "free hug" on the phone.。
He interviewed the young people.。
He asked them what they were doing.。
He interviewed the young people.。
The youngest was 14 years old.。
Was he 14 years old?。
He was 17 years old.。
He was 22 years old.。
He sat there.。
There was a store that was open 24 hours a day.。
He was selling alcohol to the young people.。
So you could sell alcohol to the young people?。
I don't know.。
I don't know.。
They were drinking.。
They were drinking.。
He asked how many girls they had hugged.。
A young man said that he had hugged 70 girls.。
70 girls.。
He asked how many girls he had kissed.。
He said that he had kissed more than 10 girls.。
The YouTuber asked him if he was happy to kiss more than 10 girls.。
He said that he was happy.。
I know that some people asked him.。
He said that he was happy.。
I didn't see this.。
Some people said that he was hiding it.。
The young man said that he was happy to kiss more than 10 girls.。
He said that he was happy to kiss more than 10 girls.。
So the event was a competition?。
No.。
You are exaggerating.。
I heard that there was a competition.。
Where was it?。
It was in Australia.。
There was a competition in Hong Kong.。
They gave you 300 dollars to support the youth.。
No, it was not like that.。
What was it?。
I really don't know.。
At first, I thought it was a free hug event.。
They gave you the power to support.。
It was a free hug.。
They gave you the power to support.。
I think that was not the event.。
It was a free hug.。
I think that was not the event.。

They gave you a free kiss and a hug.。
You walked by and someone said you could come.。
You walked by and someone said you could come.。
They gave you a free kiss and a hug.。
They gave you a free kiss and a hug.。
I want to throw up.。
Why?。
Because I was 22 years old.。
He said that he gave me a free kiss.。
He said that he gave me a free kiss.。
I want to throw up.。
I want to throw up.。
Some 14-year-old girls wrote that you could get a free kiss.。
Some 14-year-old girls wrote that you could get a free kiss.。
I don't know how the international rules work.。
I don't know how the international rules work.。
If I am wrong, I will be punished.。
I think that was the event.。
I came and I could kiss.。

They also said that if you feel right, you should go to the disabled.。

That's what they meant.。
I don't know if it's legal.。
I don't know if it's legal.。
Is it legal to go to the disabled?。
Is it legal to go to the disabled?。
It shouldn't be legal, right?。
But the question is, how do I know what he's doing in the disabled?。
But the question is, how do I know what he's doing in the disabled?。
You can't just think about it.。
You can't just think about it.。

If it's about money, it's not legal.。
If it's not about money, it's not legal.。
If it's not about money, it's not legal.。
I don't know.。

I think you should think about it personally.。
