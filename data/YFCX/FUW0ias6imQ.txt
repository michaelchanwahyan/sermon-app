Can you give a round of applause to the team?。
Whether it's AB team, CC team or the audience。
Okay。
Let's take a look at your faces。
It's so unfamiliar, I don't know why I suddenly notice your faces。
Or you've grown up a year earlier?。
It's summer vacation, you must be busy。
Are you so busy that you are exhausted?。
I hope God will continue to bless you and speak to you。
My topic today is Fighting。
I've been watching Korean dramas。
They always say "Fighting, Fighting, Fighting"。
Not only Korean dramas。
My husband told me a few months ago。
He always told me about Jackie Chan。
He said "Lately, many people are talking about Jackie Chan"。
I asked "Who is Jackie Chan?"。
"Jackie Chan, who do you think of?"。
I only know this Jackie Chan。
Lee Ka-shing。
In my generation, I said "Why am I not Lee Ka-shing?"。
I believe your generation is like。
"Why am I not Lee Ka-shing's son?"。
Right?。
I only know this Jackie Chan。
But my husband said that Jackie Chan is not Jackie Chan。
Next hard point。
This is "The Hunters"。
Song Hunter。
I was influenced by my husband。
I studied in the top level。
It's a Korean web novel。
Later, I made a cartoon。
Do you know him?。
If you don't know him, please tell me。
If you know him, please listen to it again。
He is a hunter。
He is the weakest hunter。
Many people laugh at him。
He is the weakest weapon of human。
Until he awoke。
He is much more powerful。
He keeps upgrading himself。
He is getting stronger。
One of his strong points is。
When he defeated his opponent。
He would take revenge。
And become his weapon。
Next time, he would summon his opponent。
To help him。
I mentioned a lot about Song Hunter。
What do I want to say?。
I want to say。
As a believer。
Why do I suddenly have a hair?。
Is it a moustache?。
I am so scared。
Why do I suddenly have a moustache?。
I am talking about my hair。
You are talking about my mouth。
Let's come back to the topic。
What do I want to say?。
As a believer。
We believe in Jesus。
Our spiritual life is awakened。
We are new people。
But we can't live a completely。
Spiritual life。
Why?。
Because we are participating in a spiritual battle。
In this spiritual battle。
What kind of equipment do we need。
To deal with our enemies?。
How can we win in the battle?。
I want to share with you。
Some of the reminders in the Bible。
The Bible is 6 chapters。
10 to 20 verses。
You may be familiar with the Bible。
The Book of Ecclesiastes。
I want to invite you to read it。
Ready?。
"You must rely on the Lord。
To rely on his great power to make the strong。
To wear the armor of the Father。
To resist the devil's tricks。
For our battle。
Is not against the flesh and blood。
But against those who are in power。
Who rule the dark world。
And the evil spirits of the heaven and the earth。
So you must wear the armor of the Father。
So that you can resist the enemy in the day of evil。
And after you have done all。
You can still stand。
So you must stand。
You must use truth as a bandage。
Use justice as a protective mirror。
Use peace as a shoe。
To prevent you from walking。
You must use faith as a shield。
To break the evil。
And burn all the sins。
You must wear the helmet of salvation。
And the sword of the Holy Spirit。
This is the way of God。
You must rely on the Holy Spirit。
To pray for you in all directions。
And to be vigilant for this。
Pray for the good。
Pray for me too。
Let me have the courage。
To speak out the praise of the Lord。
I have made a chain of the Lord's praise。
Let me speak out the praise of the Lord。
As I have done。
As you have prayed with the Father。
Let me pray for you。
We know that it is hard to live a good life。
By ourselves。
It is hard to live a life of the Holy Spirit。
I pray that the Lord will speak to us today。
And be with us。
Open our eyes of the Holy Spirit。
Let us see the true truth。
Let us live the truth。
By relying on the Holy Spirit。
Let us pray in the name of Jesus Christ。
Amen。
Let me talk a little bit about the simple background of the book of Ephesians。
There are six chapters in the book of Ephesians。
The first chapter is about a man who believes in Jesus。
And has a new identity。
The fourth and sixth chapters are about。
A new man with a new identity。
What should be his life behavior?。
It should be different。
The sixth chapter we just read。
The tenth chapter is about。
There are verses that say。
"From now on"。
A man who believes in the Lord。
Has a new identity。
From now on。
He should rely on the Lord to be strong。
To be strong。
According to the original text。
It is a passive order。
And the current situation。
What does it mean?。
It means that the believer。
Does not rely on himself to be strong。
He should rely on God to be strong。
And not only once。
It has a continuous meaning。
He should constantly rely on God。
Why is it so emphasized?。
After believing in the Lord。
We should rely on God。
Because the believer is facing。
A conflict。
Our opponent。
Or our enemy。
Is not a person。
But a devil in the spirit world。
The Bible describes。
The one who is in charge。
Who is in power。
Who controls the dark world。
And the devil in the spirit world。
It is a supernatural existence。
The area they control。
Is the world on earth。
Yes。
It must be。
It is the world on earth。
Especially in the aspect of sin。
And worshiping idols。
I am not talking about K-pop idols。
The fake gods。
They are behind them。
Controlling them。
Controlling them in the dark force。
So it is not by ourselves。
We can defeat the devil。
Although the devil。
Or the evil spirit。
Is very powerful。
But it will not appear casually。
To be honest。
If the devil or evil spirit。
Appears in front of us。
We will be very scared。
But I think we will。
Rely on God more。
Because it is very real。
Appears in front of us。
But it is very cunning。
The devil will not use his knife and gun。
As the saying goes。
It is hard to defend against the dark force。
But it is very cunning。
When we are not aware。
It will set traps for us。
To make us fall into the trap。
We may not even。
Realize the existence of the devil。
Because the devil。
Has been living in this world longer than us。
He knows that。
Directly showing up。
And threatening us。
Will not work。
We will have to be more sure。
Of the truth of God。
More sure。
That we need to rely on God。
But he may hide。
In the so-called feng shui。
In the constellation and the book。
In those things。
Through these processes。
We may gain some benefits。
And predict the future。
We may not realize it。
But we will believe in it。
I am serious。
Have you seen the constellation?。
Have you played the tower cards?。
I am serious。
I heard that young people。
Don't know that。
These things are not supposed to be played。
They may try to predict their future。
But it is not。
These are all the tricks of the devil。
The devil will not notice。
And set traps for us。
To make us fall into the trap。
So we need to be more sure。
Not rely on ourselves。
But rely on God。
We need to wear the full-armor。
The full-armor is called。
The whole arm of God。
The whole arm of God。
The whole arm of God。
For us to wear。
The full-armor is used。
To resist the devil。
In the 11th and 13th chapters。
It is said that we need to resist the devil。
And to be able to stand。
It is interesting。
The word "resist"。
Is the same word as "stand"。
In the 13th chapter。
Yes。
What does it mean?。
It means that we need to rely on God。
To stand steadily。
Not to win。
Not to defeat the devil。
Because we cannot defeat the devil。
Only God can defeat the devil。
But we can rely on God。
To stand steadily。
And not fall into the trap。
As a believer。
I think we want to live a life of the Lord。
We want our life。
Our life to be filled with the joy of God。
But why sometimes it does not work?。
We always fall weakly。
It is because we are facing a battle of the Lord。
We need to recognize our enemy。
Who is our enemy?。
Look at the person next to me。
Yes, it is not him。
Our enemy。
Is Satan。
It is the evil spirit。
Do you know?。
Yes。
The devil is the weakest point of all workers。
Yes。
It keeps us away from God。
Most importantly。
It is not aware of the fact that we are leaving God。
So we need to rely on God。
But sometimes。
We do not understand the spiritual growth。
Why?。
Because we are used to。
Rely on our eyes。
It is practical to see with our eyes。
I am from the previous generation。
I am definitely from the previous generation。
I am not from the second generation。
My parents are all worshipping God。
They are worshipping idols。
Worshipping false gods。
I have a landlord at home。
I worship the landlord。
I also worship God。
I did not believe in Jesus。
I asked my mother。
Who is the God I worship?。
She said。
"It does not matter。
It is just a worship of God"。
She could not answer me。
I remember when I was young。
I used to go to the temple to ask for an autograph。
I do not know if you know。
There are two types of autographs。
The upper one is good。
The lower one is bad。
It is not easy。
I remember when I asked for an autograph。
I was sincere。
If I could get the lower one。
What would you do?。
I would put it back。
I am like this。
I am like this。
When I did not believe in God。
I did superstitions。
But I found that。
You also do superstitions。
For example。
How to cut a cake?。
Do not cut it to the bottom。
Right?。
You can't cut it to the bottom。
Right?。
(Laughter)。
So there is no problem with the bottom。
It is just a superstition。
(Laughter)。
When you say something。
That does not sound good。
You will say。
"Touch wood"。
No, it is iron。
(Laughter)。
You are the new generation。
You also have superstitions。
Yes, really。
I was like this when I was young。
I had contact with idols。
I had contact with evil spirits。
Even when I was a monk。
I had experienced。
The interference of the spirit world。
I used to worship idols when I was young。
I went to many temples。
To worship gods。
I had many contact with the spirit world。
Even when I was a Christian。
I had experienced the interference of the spirit world。
I tried to sleep。
I was afraid。
I was afraid。
I was afraid that I would cover my ears。
(Laughter)。
I tried to sleep。
I could not move。
I was rational。
It was a psychological effect。
I tried to close my eyes。
I could not close my eyes。
I could not move。
I was afraid。
When I was young。
I was not in the "Yin and Fung" church。
I was in another church。
They taught me very quickly。
If you encounter evil spirits。
Remember to run away in Jesus' name。
I ran away in Jesus' name。
I could not move。
I was afraid。
They even talked to me。
I was very nervous。
There was a man talking to me。
I said, "Run away in Jesus' name"。
He talked to me。
He said, "Jesus, I know him"。
I was very afraid。
I could not move。
It was very interesting。
I do not know why。
Suddenly, a song came to my mind。
A poem came to my mind。
I sang this poem in primary school。
I sang this poem for 6 years。
I grew up in a Catholic school。
Can you guess what song I sang?。
You know it, Xiao Feng?。
(Laughter)。
Stop kidding。
What is it?。
My poem is called "This is the world of the rich"。
I sang this poem for 6 years。
Suddenly, a poem came to my mind。
"This is the world of the rich"。
I fell asleep。
I was relaxed。
Sister, I do not want to scare you。
I do not want to scare you。
I want to tell you that。
the spiritual world is very real。
I do not expect you to encounter this。
Do not worry。
We who belong to God。
have God's protection。
Do not worry。
In the end, the devil will leave me。
and leave you。
God will protect you。
But really。
Sister, the spiritual world is very real。
Of course, the devil will not use such a cheap trick。
like I did in the past。
I was scared and became a propagandist。
(Laughter)。
He will not use such a trick to scare you。
Because he knows it will not work。
It may even have a counter effect。
Maybe he is more faithful。
God is very real。
But really。
The devil may use other things to lure us。
to make us fall into weakness。
and make us leave God。
We need to recognize who our enemy is。
We need to use the right weapon to deal with him。
Okay。
Use the right weapon。
What weapon?。
Let's continue to look at the scripture below。
What is in this weapon?。
Let's look at the 14th chapter。
It appears again。
It is about the balance。
The balance in the 14th chapter。
is the same as in the 11th and 13th chapters。
So it emphasizes that we must stand firm。
and not be hit by the devil。
What does this weapon include?。
It includes the truth。
The truth is about the gospel。
and the teaching of the Bible。
The word "truth" means to be ready。
It means to be ready。
Are you familiar with the Bible?。
Are you ready to tell people about the Bible?。
Or are you just a half bottle of water?。
Use justice as a shield。
It means we need to be a faithful。
and righteous person。
But today。
we need to show our righteousness。
Use peace and harmony as a bridge。
This sentence is from the Old Testament。
It says we need to have a job of preaching。
We need to take the initiative。
to share the content of the gospel。
"Believe and act as a shield。
to wipe out all the evil"。
A rocket will cause harm to the enemy。
and even disturb the people。
But it may not be fatal。
The same goes for the devil。
The devil may not give us a fatal blow。
but it may disturb our faith。
and our vigilance。
So we need to resist with faith。
Also, wear a helmet of salvation。
It is very important。
We are saved today。
No one can condemn us。
We will not go to hell。
We are already saved in the presence of God。
This is very important。
The sword of the Holy Spirit is the way of God。
The Bible is the way of God。
I have talked about this military uniform。
You may have heard of it since you were a child。
Have you noticed。
the special feature of this uniform?。
It is often used as a defensive weapon。
It is not very aggressive。
Even the sword of the Holy Spirit。
is a word of God。
It reminds me of Jesus。
when he was tested。
He used the word of God。
to defeat the devil。
It seems that this military uniform。
is not for close combat。
but for defensive。
Yes。
As believers。
we need to know the truth。
Is it safe?。
Is it well-known?。
Can we keep the faith?。
Can we distinguish。
which is the word of God。
which is the will of God。
which is the trick of the devil。
so that we will not fall into the trap of the devil。
Our life and actions。
can only come out of the Christian style。
and the gospel。
As I said。
the devil is very smart。
He will not show up to scare us。
but to attack our weak spot。
and make us fall from God。
I heard a young man say。
why do I always pray。
but God does not listen to me。
and I am still in a lot of trouble。
But the person next to me。
or the people I do not believe in。
may live a better life than me。
Should I still keep the faith?。
Do I really believe that God exists?。
I don't know if you feel the same。
When something unpleasant。
happens in our life。
we start to question God。
Is God real?。
Does God love me?。
Does prayer work?。
Is this faith possible?。
Just now。
when DSC released the list。
Sister, I don't know how many of you。
have faced DSC and released the list。
When you see the results。
do you question God?。
God, why don't you bless me?。
Why did my Chinese break?。
Will it happen?。
Sometimes the devil uses these situations。
to make us question。
God, are you real?。
God, do you love me?。
The devil uses these situations。
to make us question God。
Or maybe。
today。
I know many of you are busy。
in the service。
You are busy in the service。
but the devil can test us。
in the service。
Maybe you are busy。
in the service。
You are the group leader。
You are the senior mentor。
You are the first camp leader。
You are the first camp leader。
You are the one who went to Cambodia。
You are the one who went to Taiwan。
You are the one who went to the local school。
You should not be the one。
You met the local school in Taiwan。
Are you really busy?。
You are really busy in the service。
but you do not forget。
that there are more important things。
than the service。
Some people say。
in the service。
you interact with people。
there are many conflicts。
which make you。
have many friction with the senior mentors。
which hurts your faith。
and your faith。
You even have a broken relationship。
with the group。
Yes。
Not necessarily in the church。
but in the church。
the devil can not test you。
in the church。
Maybe the devil is testing us。
with these things。
and hurting our faith。
and destroying our。
relationship with the faith。
Jesus said。
Satan will get you。
Next passage。
Next passage。
Next PowerPoint, please。
He said。
He will get you like a piece of tin。
What does it mean?。
It means he will get you。
in a simple way。
Yes。
It is true。
So sisters。
you should wear the uniform。
and stand up straight。
to distinguish。
which is the voice of the devil。
and which is the voice of God。
which is the voice of the Bible。
How does God look at me?。
How does God look at me?。
What does God want me to do?。
Yes。
God does not want me。
to lose my faith。
God does not want me。
to fail in my studies。
God does not want me。
to destroy my relationship。
with others。
God does not want me。
to be at odds。
with you。
God does not want me。
to be away from the group。
or the faith。
You may encounter。
something unintentional。
We should distinguish。
between the two。
The word "village"。
in the word "village"。
refers to a village。
It means that you will not be able to take it off。
when you wear it。
It means that you will not be able to。
take it off。
when you wear it。
when it is cold。
or when it is hot。
or when you wear a jacket。
It does not mean that。
You will not be able to take it off。
when you wear it。
We are not。
wearing the uniform。
as a choice。
We are not。
listening to God's words。
as a choice。
You may ask。
"I do not have to wear。
the uniform all the time。
I am not that weak。
I do not fall into。
the trap of the devil。
I do not lose my confidence。
I do not doubt God。
If you have the chance。
to read the second chapter。
the first chapter。
In the second to the third chapter。
it says。
"When"。
"When"。
means when we do not believe in God。
"you will live。
in sin again。
and will be a leader。
in the world。
who is the devil。
who is now working in the hearts of the wicked。
We have also lived。
in their midst。
indulging in the lust of flesh。
and doing what the flesh。
and the thoughts of the heart。
do, like others。
and we will be。
the ones who are punished。
What is it saying?。
Paul reminds us。
that when we do not believe in God。
we like those lives。
we like those criminal lives。
we like the test of the devil。
we like to do what we do。
We are used to it。
So, the bad things。
falling into the trap of the devil。
are just things that happen。
casually。
Doing bad things。
is more comfortable for us。
Because before we believe in God。
we are used to。
those lives。
Doing things that do not。
conform to God's will。
and offending God。
is more comfortable for us。
So, we need to remind ourselves。
to wear this uniform。
and not take it off。
Sisters。
We need to discern the voice of the devil。
and resist the test of the devil。
We need to wear this uniform。
not according to our preferences。
but wear it often。
so that we can。
resist the test of the devil。
and make our lives。
stand steadily。
At last。
the 18th to 20th verses。
It talks about prayer。
According to the structure of the original text。
what is it saying?。
Prayer has two purposes。
The first purpose is。
to make me have the ability。
to speak openly。
and to be proud of my recitation。
The second purpose is。
to make me be able to。
speak out openly。
according to my duty。
Actually, these two purposes。
are similar。
Simply speaking。
it is related to the recitation。
We need to do a good job。
in the recitation。
But to do a good job。
in the recitation。
it is important for many people。
to believe in Jesus。
and to pray。
Paul saw that。
he needed to pray for him。
Why did he need to pray for Paul?。
Because at that time。
when Paul was writing this letter。
he was in prison。
He was arrested。
He was in prison。
He could not freely。
preach the gospel。
He hoped to be released earlier。
If you are familiar with the Bible。
you will know that。
Paul was very powerful。
Although he was in prison。
he continued to preach the gospel。
to the soldiers and the prisoners。
So Paul prayed for his disciples。
Even if he was in prison。
he hoped he could。
preach the gospel。
and make people believe in Jesus。
But it is very special。
Paul not only asked people。
to pray for him。
Paul also said。
to pray for the disciples。
including him and me。
I guess。
the disciples were worried。
about Paul。
whether he was in prison。
or something happened。
whether he was sick。
They prayed for the disciples。
Maybe the disciples。
lost their faith。
Paul was a great。
missionary。
a great man。
He was in prison。
and suffered。
It was hurting the disciples' faith。
So they prayed for the disciples。
not to lose their faith。
because of Paul's imprisonment。
But I believe。
what is more important。
is that the disciples。
need to preach the gospel。
because preaching the gospel。
is not Paul's sole responsibility。
All the disciples。
are the messengers of the gospel。
We are all responsible。
So we need to do。
this kind of work。
But to do this kind of work。
we need the help of the Holy Spirit。
It is not just me praying for the disciples。
I pray for them to be strong and strong。
to be rich。
to make them believe in Jesus。
It is not just me。
to convince them。
to repent and believe in the gospel。
It is the Holy Spirit。
working in their hearts。
The Holy Spirit is God。
No matter what we say。
we cannot leave God。
We cannot not rely on God。
Prayer is very important。
Prayer is a humble heart。
We need to pray to God。
to help us。
"God, I cannot do this。
Please help me"。
It is a humble heart。
to pray to God for help。
The gospel is not。
a personal gift。
It is a success。
because of the power of the gospel。
What is more important。
is the work of the Holy Spirit。
in people's hearts。
I would like to share。
a story about the gospel。
with you。
Once, a brother。
whose father was sick。
and was admitted to the hospital。
He asked me to preach the gospel。
This brother。
had believed in the gospel for more than 10 years。
He was holding a lamp。
and was praying。
"Hail to the Lord, the Lord is with us"。
Do you know this?。
I do not know。
I always think you are the second generation。
You do not understand the gospel。
Or。
"Please put a Hello Kitty here"。
No, it is the "Cat of God"。
(Laughter)。
"Please put it there"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"I have a bad luck today"。
"It's our first time meeting"。
"Don't be so aggressive"。
"Let's talk first"。
"Let's care about Uncle"。
"I remember when I left"。
"I told Uncle"。
"Uncle, let me pray for you"。
"Okay, Uncle"。
"I'm willing to pray"。
"But suddenly"。
"Auntie took out a Buddha's mouth"。
"You wear it first"。
"Wear the Buddha's mouth first"。
"I'm praying"。
"But you wear the Buddha's mouth"。
"Do you understand?"。
"At that moment, I immediately felt"。
"Wow, it's really a battle of the soul"。
"It's good"。
"Auntie took out the Buddha's mouth"。
"Auntie immediately came out"。
"Don't do that, Grandma"。
"Let's put the Buddha's mouth down first"。
"Let's pray first"。
"It's good, she put the Buddha's mouth down"。
"I prayed for Uncle"。
"After praying"。
"I heard Uncle"。
"talking to me in Amman"。
"But it was very quiet"。
"Then a few days later"。
"Another missionary"。
"visited Uncle"。
"It was very amazing"。
"The missionary said"。
"That day, Uncle visited"。
"not me, another missionary"。
"A retired missionary"。
"Uncle was very energetic"。
"Very energetic"。
"He was willing to listen to the recitation"。
"He listened to the entire recitation"。
"He even decided to believe in God"。
"I was very grateful"。
"Brother told me"。
"Brother said, "I'm very grateful"。
"A few days later, this retired missionary"。
"came to listen to the recitation with my father"。
"He decided to believe in God"。
"He said, "Don't do that"。
"Hurry up"。
"I immediately said, "How about this"。
"I will do the ceremony with him"。
"Uncle's physical condition was not good"。
"A few days later"。
"I went up to do the ceremony with him"。
"It was the second time I met Uncle"。
"I felt that Uncle's spirit was much worse"。
"Even his response and voice were much weaker"。
"But I was very grateful"。
"Every time I asked him"。
"Did you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior?"。
"His answer was very clear"。
