and do many things that are against God's will。
What St Paul was talking about was not people who did not believe in God。
He was talking about believers。
What does the Bible say?。
He says, 'there shall be no obstacles in your help'。
When it comes to believers。
you should no longer be the same as those who did not believe in God。
You should have left the darkness and sins。
You should no longer do things that are the same as those who did not believe in God。
You should not do things that offend God。
But believers are still in the darkness。
Why are believers still in the darkness?。
Why are they separated from God?。
It is because they are ignorant and stubborn。
Not only that。
Let's look at the 19th chapter。
In the 19th chapter, the New Testament is even more straightforward。
The New Testament says,。
"Since they are ignorant, they should be free to do all kinds of things that are against God's will"。
What is he talking about?。
He is talking about people's choices。
People should be firm in their hearts。
People should be free to do all kinds of things that are against God's will。
In English, he says,。
"Greedy to practice every kind of impurity"。
It means that you want to practice。
What is he talking about?。
Not just once。
It is repeated over and over again。
These practices may even become a habit。
It turns out that believers should have left the darkness。
They should have been in the light。
But they deliberately chose to break the law。
They went back to the darkness again and again。
And separated themselves from God。
When we look at this, we understand。
Why did Paul use such a strict, strict, and high-level sermon?。
Because it is people's will。
It is people's choice。
And this kind of life。
The life of leaving God。
The life in the darkness。
Is not able to build the body of Christ。
To raise Christ to glory。
But I think。
There is no reason for believers not to know。
Why do they fall back into the darkness so easily?。
Or maybe they are not willing to leave the darkness。
Let's understand what darkness means。
Darkness means that there is no light。
God did not make darkness。
God made light, but lost the light。
In ancient times, light was generally used。
To represent rational thinking。
In Judaism, light represents life。
It is mentioned in the Bible that light is Jesus himself。
It is God himself。
When people lose the light。
It means that they leave God。
Their hearts become dark。
They lose their rational thinking。
When they lose the light in the darkness。
Their souls become anxious, anxious, and fearful。
All kinds of worries come out。
How do we settle these fears, worries, and pressures?。
People will do many things to help themselves settle their anxieties。
And what is the easiest thing to do?。
It is to do the things in the world。
It is the easiest thing to do。
When we can do these things in the world。
It is really OK。
We can have a moment of peace。
We can really settle some things。
Then we may want to do more。
We want to do more in the world。
When we do more in the world。
The distance between us and God will be further and further。
When the distance between us and God is further and further。
What will happen to our hearts?。
We will continue to be in the darkness。
When we are in the darkness, the anxiety will come out。
In the end, we will be in an infinite cycle。
We will keep practicing this mode。
So why did the Bible say that our hearts become numb?。
Because we have been used to practicing。
We don't know how to find God。
We are used to being in the darkness。
Especially when we are under a lot of pressure。
And when we are in trouble。
We will easily want to throw up。
The habit of throwing up。
Will easily appear in our lives。
I remember。
When I was still working at the workplace。
I remembered my colleagues。
My colleagues love to drink。
Of course, drinking is not a crime。
But I want to say that they don't drink。
They drink。
Do you know what drinking is?。
You know, right?。
You don't know? I see you are looking away。
That's great, you are so simple。
You drink until you are drunk。
They love to drink。
They drink when they are happy。
Because they are happy。
Drinking makes them happier。
What if they are not happy?。
They drink even more。
Because they will be sober after getting drunk。
They will be drunk。
They will throw up and talk nonsense。
Some people will hug and kiss。
It's scary when a man kisses a woman。
Why do they drink when they are happy?。
Why do they drink when they are not happy?。
I believe。
They are under a lot of pressure at work。
They want to solve the pressure immediately。
They are not happy。
Drinking is a good way。
It brings a moment of happiness。
It brings a moment of happiness。
I believe they know。
It's not good for your body to get drunk with alcohol。
Some people drink until。
They look like they won't drink anymore。
They know it's not good, but they are used to it。
They can't change it。
They drink because they have to。
That's why they are happy。
They have to get drunk。
To forget their pain。
I think of young people。
They are under a lot of pressure。
At home, in their growth。
Or in their studies。
In their relationships。
They are under a lot of pressure。
They will use the way of cutting their hands。
To solve their inner pain。
They know it's not good to cut their hands。
It hurts, right?。
And if they cut their hands。
They will have to wear long sleeves in summer。
To cover it。
They don't dare to wear short sleeves。
But why do they still cut their hands?。
Because the pain in their heart is too painful。
They can't solve the pressure and pain。
They would rather their body's pain。
Can reduce their inner pain。
And it seems to work。
929 is a habit。
Continuous practice is a habit。
Yes, sisters。
I don't know。
Although we believe in God。
Our lives are saved by God。
But are there some things。
We can't get rid of the darkness?。
There are some things we should know。
Don't do it。
It's offensive to God。
It's not pleasant。
But are we using。
Some thoughts that don't fit God's mind。
Our way of life。
To deal with our insecurity?。
It even becomes our habit。
So we inadvertently。
Still stay in the darkness。
In the darkness。
And make us。
Get farther and farther away from God?。
Sister Ling。
I don't know what method you are using。
To deal with your pressure。
What method。
To deal with your insecurity?。
These methods。
These life styles。
Have they made you。
Get farther away from God?。
Let's continue。
When we say。
There are still these old life styles。
Or these habits。
That make us fall into the darkness。
How can we return to the light?。
In the 20th chapter。
It says。
"But what you learned from Christ is not like this"。
"But"。
Usually。
The word "but"。
Is used to make a strong comparison。
I want to tell the believers。
Believers。
You shouldn't be like this。
You should be like Christ。
You shouldn't be like what I said。
Like the believers。
To be like Christ。
There is a verse that says。
I want to use the New Testament to make it clearer。
The New Testament says。
"You must have heard of his testimony"。
"And have received the teaching in him"。
"For the truth is in Jesus"。
The Bible uses the word "if"。
As if it is a conditional sentence。
A question sentence。
No。
This is a very solid statement。
What does it say?。
"For the truth is in Jesus"。
"And have received the teaching in him"。
And "receive"。
He uses the word "receive"。
Receive is not just about knowing。
Or knowing the truth。
It also includes the truth。
There is a very special verse。
He says。
"The truth is in Jesus"。
It's very interesting。
In the book of Paul。
The name "Jesus"。
Is not used often。
Because it is usually used to mean。
Jesus Christ。
Or Jesus Christ。
Or Jesus Christ。
The name "Jesus"。
Is very rare in the book of Paul。
I believe Paul wanted to tell the believers。
Jesus is a man who can live。
And speak the truth。
The believers should follow Jesus。
The believers should follow Jesus。
Not just to hear the truth。
But to listen to the teachings。
Or to understand。
And to carry out the teachings。
The truth。
Not just to hear。
But to carry it out。
Then。
In 22-24。
He tells us。
How to carry out the teachings of Jesus Christ。
In these three verses。
There are three uncertainties。
They are "discard"。
"renew"。
And "re-enact"。
Let's first look at。
"re-enact" and "discard"。
Because these two words are actually one word。
I found that the translation of "New Testament of Japan" is clearer。
No need to explain so much。
He says in "New Testament of Japan"。
"Discard" means to remove the old man。
This old man belongs to your past lifestyle。
"Discard" means to follow the old man。
"Discard" means to follow the old man。
"The lust of the heart is growing day by day"。
We need to discard。
What is "discard"?。
It's about our old lifestyle。
Until we no longer follow。
The lifestyle of the non-believers。
Or the non-believers。
Of course。
Not all non-believers have problems。
They are all wrong。
What is he talking about?。
That lifestyle is to follow the lust of the heart。
Those who have problems。
Those who offend God。
The lifestyle of the non-believers。
We need to leave。
If you have the opportunity。
You can also look at the following 25-32 chapters。
There are more examples。
About what is not in line with God's will。
What is offending God。
Those things will lead the believers to leave God。
Farther and farther。
What do the believers need to do?。
They need to leave。
They need to stop this lifestyle。
Yes, they need to stop。
They can't have this lifestyle anymore。
This kind of habit。
Then we look at "discard"。
As I said, it's a pair。
It's like wearing clothes。
Except for a dirty shirt。
You need to wear a new shirt。
What is this shirt?。
It is to follow the image of God。
I don't know what you think of when you hear this。
You should think of God's creator。
Adam and Eve are made according to God's image。
Yes, we should be like Adam and Eve。
Made according to God's image。
We can be a new person。
Just like Adam and Eve in the beginning。
At the time of Eden。
They are no longer separated from God。
Very close to God。
We can live out the purpose of God's creation。
Our life can live out God's will。
But because of sin。
We are separated from God。
But Jesus Christ's redemption。
Let us return to God's embrace again。
Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life。
Lead us back to God's embrace。
And the punishment that Jesus suffered。
And the punishment that Jesus suffered。
We should live out God's will。
So that we can return to God's embrace。
And become holy。
Yes, we should stop our old behavior。
Stop, don't do it again。
We should be a new person。
We should do the old things。
Don't do the dirty things。
But we should do the things that are in harmony with God's will。
And the last word is。
"Renew"。
In English, it means to be renewed in the spirit of your mind。
It's not just about renewing our mind。
It's our mind。
Are we willing to be changed by God?。
Are we willing to use a new way。
A renewed way。
To live out a new person, a new way of life?。
Why do we need to renew?。
Why do we need to use new things?。
Because the old things are not compatible。
It's like when you upgrade your phone and computer。
But you don't upgrade, you buy a new one。
You don't need to update the iOS, right?。
I don't know, I don't know。
Why do we need to change?。
To upgrade or to change a new phone or a new computer。
Because we need to adapt to the new era。
I have the courage to ask。
Is there anyone still using their phone。
To type and type in but not able to go online?。
Is there anyone still using this type of phone?。
Watchman, you seem to want to raise your hand。
We are basically normal。
Of course, there are some people who really need it。
Because they have two phones。
Maybe one of their phones is really just for typing。
But I believe most of us are using a smartphone。
Smartphone。
Yes, because of the need of the times。
If we are just using a phone for typing。
Our life is actually quite difficult。
Just going to a restaurant, you may not be able to eat。
Because the restaurant is ordering food。
You have to do the dishes yourself。
No one serves you。
Yes。
Because we need to adapt to a new life。
So we need to upgrade。
Yes, today, we believe in God。
We are new people, we need to upgrade and change。
Only by being able to adapt to a new life。
Can we be able to express God's will。
It's very interesting。
These three groups of words。
If we just look at "disappear" and "rebirth"。
We can understand what they mean。
But it's very interesting。
You will find that "disappear" is above。
"rebirth" is below。
"rebirth" is in the middle of "disappear"。
Yes, this is an important expression。
"rebirth" is very important。
Because our heart is affecting our brain。
Our brain is affecting how we walk。
This is how people should work。
Your heart is first。
Think about it。
If I want to buy a new computer。
My brain needs to think。
To decide the price。
Who is the cheapest。
Then I will buy it。
This is how it should work。
So, the word "rebirth" is in the middle。
It's very important。
If we don't want to。
It's very difficult to take action to coordinate。
Also, the word "rebirth"。
The original Chinese character is a present tense。
Yes, it's very interesting。
"Disappear" and "rebirth" are past tense。
The present tense has a continuous meaning。
It means to keep rebirthing。
It's not enough to rebirth once。
We need to keep rebirthing。
Why?。
Why do we need to keep rebirthing?。
I believe it's because。
Our old habits。
Our old lifestyle。
Have been with us for too long。
These habits are easy to get out of。
We need to be gifted。
To keep rebirthing our heart。
To remind us again。
How to live out the Christian lifestyle。
Just like when we go to a restaurant。
We need to count the K-codes before we order。
At first, we are not used to it。
We want to ask the waiters to order。
But we need to count the codes。
When we are asked to do so。
But as we count the codes。
Maybe today。
You will count the codes naturally。
We need to get used to it。
We need to practice。
Because the old thinking is very rigid。
We need to break the old thinking。
And create a new habit。
We need to learn from our habits。
Don't let the old thinking come out so easily。
Ask God first。
Ask the Heavens。
Or think about。
This habit, this response。
Is it in conflict with the principles of the Bible?。
We need to practice。
Ask the Heavens more。
Don't let the old thinking come out so easily。
We need the help of the Holy Spirit。
We need the Holy Spirit's reminder。
So that we can have the right choice。
And make a right choice。
Sisters。
We really need the Holy Spirit。
And rely on God。
So that we can live out the Christian lifestyle。
It may not be easy。
Because we have lived for so many years。
We have so many habits and cultures。
It is hard for us to get rid of them。
But we can change。
We can practice。
We can practice and change our old habits。
Create a new habit。
A habit that we can rely on the Heavens。
And pray to God。
Don't rely on yourself。
Lastly, I would like to share my experiences。
The reminders that the Heavens give me in my life。
I am a person who is afraid of doing the wrong things。
Because I always did the wrong things when I was young。
What would happen if I did the wrong things?。
Have you ever experienced doing the wrong things?。
Have you ever done the wrong things?。
Wow, you are really good at it。
You are wrong。
Usually, people will scold you for doing the wrong things。
I was always scolded when I was young。
I have a low self-image。
I always thought I was a useless person。
I was always criticized。
So I really want to do well。
Because I am afraid of doing the wrong things。
Because I will be scolded if I do the wrong things。
So I really want to work hard。
To do better things。
So that I won't be scolded。
But I will bring this pattern or habit。
into my appearance。
I also have this tendency。
It sounds like nothing。
But it's not。
When I really want to do well。
No matter what I arrange。
Whether it's a meeting or a speech。
Or if there is a problem in my life。
I will deal with it immediately。
I want to think more。
Plan better。
Do better。
The best is to deal with all the problems。
And settle them。
When I settle all these things。
I won't feel insecure。
I won't be scolded if I do well。
I will have this pattern of doing things。
Now I am learning。
It's quite tiring to do this all the time。
Doing everything well。
It's tiring for my life。
Now I am learning。
Do I have to do something immediately?。
Do I have to deal with things immediately?。
Do I have to go beyond all these things?。
Or should I pray first?。
To give up the difficulties I face。
Or the difficulties that the sisters face。
I remember I told the sisters。
At the beginning of the year。
I don't remember if I said this on this platform。
I remember I said this on React。
The lesson I want to learn in 2024。
Is to learn to let go。
I should learn to let go。
Don't hold on to things so tightly。
Don't rely on your own efforts。
I have to practice。
How to let go and give to God。
Recently, a brother shared with me。
The situation of his sisters。
I was very worried。
Just like me in the past。
I have a habit of saying。
"You have a problem? We should talk about it"。
"We should make an appointment"。
I said we should make an appointment。
To solve these problems。
Don't make the relationship。
Too tense。
Or maybe a lot of things are just misunderstandings。
I hope we can solve it quickly。
I said we should make an appointment。
But the brother said。
"I don't know what to do"。
"We should try to talk about it"。
"We are all grown up now"。
"We are all mature now"。
"We can try to solve it"。
He told me not to interfere。
I thought。
"Yes, you are all grown up"。
"You are all mature"。
"Why can't I trust you with these things?"。
"I should trust you"。
"You have the ability to solve it"。
"You have the ability to solve it"。
"You have the ability to solve it"。
"You have the ability to solve it"。
"I should trust you"。
"You have the ability to solve it"。
"Yes, God has mentioned me"。
"I should trust you"。
"You have the ability to solve it"。
"I should learn to let go"。
To me, it was a new experience。
To me, it was a new experience。
It was my habit。
I jump in when I have something to talk about。
I jump in when I have something to talk about。
But now I am learning。
But now I am learning。
I am learning。
I give my head to God。
I realize that。
I realize that。
I don't have to do too much。
I don't have to do too much。
I have the opportunity to grow。
I have the opportunity to grow。
It is a lesson of trust and communication。
I trust my sisters。
I trust my sisters。
They carry a lot of things。
They carry a lot of things。
They do things well。
I trust them。
I don't know, sisters。
I don't know, sisters。
Do you have anything to update?。
Do you have anything to update?。
I don't know what word you have created in the beginning of 2024。
I don't know what word you have created in the beginning of 2024。
It is the end of 2024。
Do you have any word to create?。
It is the end of 2024。
It is the end of 2024。
I don't know what you have to update。
I don't know what you have to update。
I don't know what you have to update。
I hope you can practice new habits。
I hope you can practice new habits。
These habits will help you to be closer to God。
These habits will help you to be closer to God。
These habits will help us to leave the darkness。
These habits will help us to be closer to God。
These habits will help us to be closer to God。
These habits will help us to be closer to God。
I don't know if you have any。
I don't know if you have any。
Sisters, sometimes I feel it is not easy。
Sisters, sometimes I feel it is not easy。
Because we have lived for so many years。
Many things are very considerate。
Many things come out naturally。
There are some ways to respond。
There are some ways to respond。
There are some ways to respond。
But some things, some ways。
May not be in harmony。
Maybe these habits。
May lead us to leave God。
May lead us to leave God。
We need the Holy Spirit to remind us。
We need a new perspective。
A new way。
To bring Christ out。
I know it is not easy。
But we can practice。
But we can practice。
To make us more accustomed。
To rely on God。
Not on ourselves。
I will put the Bible on the table。
I will put the Bible on the table。
Sisters, I don't know。
What is your life situation?。
What is your life situation?。
What is your life situation?。
Are there any things。
That make us stay in the darkness?。
That make us stay in the darkness?。
Next Sunday is Christmas。
It is the day of the resurrection of Christ。
It is the day of the resurrection of Christ。
Christ is the true light。
He will shine on the darkness。
He will shine on the darkness。
He will shine on those who are trapped。
He will shine on those who are trapped。
He will take people out of the darkness。
He will take people out of the darkness。
Into a wonderful light。
Into a wonderful light。
Into a wonderful light。
