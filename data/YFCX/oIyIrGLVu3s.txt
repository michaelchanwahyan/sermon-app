When I saw Woody, I thought he was holding a gold medal。
to thank the people around him。
But I'm really grateful。
to hear about the growth of their faith。
Sister Ding, I don't know what you think。
after hearing their story。
This year is very special。
I think if you share it with them。
they will know for sure。
As they said。
they are not the sisters who serve in the Youth Ministry。
They go to camp and to the short-term school。
They have different experiences and different growth。
But after hearing their stories。
Sister Ding, I want to ask you。
Give you five seconds to think。
After this summer vacation。
or looking back at your faith a year ago。
your faith life。
to this moment。
is there any difference?。
Your relationship with God。
your relationship with the team。
or even your faith in life。
Give you five seconds to think。
Is there any difference?。
Five seconds should be enough。
I don't know what you think。
This year's theme is。
Transform Our Lives Going for Christ。
I don't know how much of your life。
you have implemented。
the theme of this year。
But I think these two weeks。
after participating in different activities。
we have done some reviews。
to think about how you are doing this summer。
We also have an experience。
We think that this summer。
we feel that many sisters in the Youth Ministry。
your spirit, your faith。
and your commitment are back。
You are willing to do。
and try。
Even in the camp。
you are willing to explore more。
to ask more about what faith is。
This year, in the coming new year。
we will have a new theme。
In fact, the worship of the church。
is also the direction of our new theme。
This year's new direction。
we want to do one thing。
to show God's way。
to walk into the corner of the world。
The theme of today's sermon is。
Alive in Christ, Let's Go and Shine。
This is what we want to do。
with you in the Youth Ministry in the new year。
I think in the new year。
I want to take you one step further。
to see what we have done。
In the past two years。
we have done many different short sermons。
and many different services。
to explore faith。
But this year, I really want to。
through the sermon of the Church of Christ。
to broaden your vision of faith。
I think in the past few years。
we have often talked to you about。
life growth, life transformation。
We need to experience God more。
We will continue to。
experience and explore these with you。
But I think this year。
I want to take one step further。
to show that our faith。
is not just about our own lives。
but also to broaden your vision of faith。
It turns out that。
our faith is not just about ourselves。
It turns out that our faith has many things。
that God's perspective can be so broad。
Today, I want to share with you。
the 60 chapters of the New Testament。
the 60 chapters of the New Testament。
and see how the New Testament。
will lead us to this year's theme。
Let's talk about the background of the New Testament。
There are 66 chapters in the New Testament。
People usually divide the 66 chapters into three parts。
The 60 chapters we are going to look at today。
are in the third part。
The third part of the New Testament。
is very special。
It has a very important theme。
It only talks about the message of salvation。
It doesn't talk about the judgment。
or other messages。
The 62 chapters。
are the very core message of the third part。
It talks about the scene。
when Jerusalem was rebuilt。
and glorified。
and even the rebuilding of the temple。
When we look at the 60 chapters today。
there are similarities with the 59 chapters。
because there are many similar words。
such as glory, salvation, justice, light。
The 59 chapters are about。
the world without salvation or justice。
Only God can bring these things out。
It also talks about the coming of the Messiah。
and the people's being a symbol of justice。
and other themes。
Today, we are going to look at only three chapters。
These three chapters are the main theme。
of the whole 60 chapters。
Let's read the three chapters together。
Let's read the 60 chapters of the New Testament。
Chapter 1-3。
Ready?。
"Behold, the light is coming,。
and the glory of the Lord is coming to you.。
See, the darkness covers the earth,。
and the darkness covers the people.。
The Lord is coming, and the glory of the Lord is coming to you.。
The glory of the Lord is coming to you.。
The glory of the Lord is coming to you."。
You may be familiar with this song。
because you often sing this song。
Before we enter the scripture。
let's pray together。
Lord, lead us。
Let us be filled with your heart。
Let us let your words。
come to our lives。
Lord, lead us with your light。
Lead us in the new year。
Let us learn how to live in faith。
and how to live in life。
Lord, lead us。
Thank you, Lord, for your help。
Lord, bless us。
We have just read the three chapters。
In the three chapters。
we may ask a question。
What are you referring to?。
In the third part of Isaiah。
we see that the "you"。
is referring to the rock。
and to Jerusalem。
This is a call to the rock。
The rock is to shine。
and to bring forth。
the reason why it should do so。
The light has come。
The glory of the Lord is coming to you。
We may ask, what is the light?。
The light is not coming from the rock。
but from God。
So the announcement is about。
God coming to the rock。
Then the next sentence is。
"The glory of the Lord is coming to you"。
We may ask, what is the meaning。
of "is coming to you"?。
The word "discover"。
is a meaning of rising。
This word is constantly used。
in the three chapters。
because the word "discover"。
is the same as "rise"。
It is like a scene。
when the sun rises。
and shines on the earth。
It is a similar scene。
Likewise, when we read this word。
we may focus on the word "glory"。
"Brother, I don't know what glory is"。
We often talk about glory。
I don't know if you know what it is。
The word "glory"。
has a special meaning in Hebrew。
It refers to something that is important。
and real。
It usually refers to the glory of God。
or even the glory of God。
But this word, especially here。
is about God's appearance。
God's presence。
and even God's authority over His people。
So we see that this sentence。
is a message that is balanced。
God's presence is with Zion。
God wants to shine on Zion。
This announcement may seem far away。
to us who are reading this。
But it is very meaningful。
to the readers of the time。
Why?。
Because for the entire people of Israel。
when we look back at their entire experience。
what was the time when。
Jehovah's Witnesses and their glory。
were together?。
It was when they left Egypt。
and stayed in Mount Sinai。
Later, when their people developed。
when the king of Solomon went to build the temple。
at the time of the offering。
Jehovah's Witnesses were among them。
But when their people。
started to leave God。
different Bible records。
have Jehovah's Witnesses。
leaving Jerusalem。
Later, they went through the kingdom of the king。
and the city of Beelzebub。
and the city of Zeon。
and became a group of tyrants。
So when we talk about Jehovah's Witnesses。
and their glory。
what is important is that。
the entire people。
experienced a transformation。
and were resurrected。
What we see is that。
the people of Israel。
were connected to the nobles on earth。
and wanted to glorify themselves。
But the people were gone。
But Jehovah said。
that he wanted to come to Zeon。
to resurrect them。
I think for the readers of the time。
what they saw was。
that they were able to experience salvation。
and the king of the tribes。
was able to realize。
the promise Jehovah made to them。
I think what Jehovah is saying here。
is that the glory and light of Jehovah。
should be glorified in Zeon。
and be resurrected in the darkness of Zeon。
I think what Jehovah is saying here。
is that the people of Israel。
and the entire people。
were revived and experienced a transformation。
I think the book of Exodus is very special。
In addition to talking about the situation at the time。
it also represents the events of the New Testament。
We often hear about the New Testament。
I think that when the New Testament is written。
people can be able to shine a light on life。
through the light of Jesus Christ。
and also let people experience life's changes。
Similarly, after 2,000 years。
we are still here。
I think we are experiencing the same things。
The glory of God, the presence of God。
the light of God shining on our lives。
are all shared by people during the summer。
However, brothers and sisters。
when we look back at the summer。
we have watched the videos。
we have a lot of experiences。
in the short stories and the camp。
We have a lot of letters。
In the camp of the Great Zion。
we have a lot of different letters。
In the camp of the early days。
we made a sheep。
to shine a light on the world。
There are a lot of different letters。
In the camp of the high school。
that house was destroyed。
There are a lot of different letters。
I think we have a lot of letters。
that are very special。
In the three camps this year。
there are a lot of letters。
with a lot of lights。
and different themes。
We say that we want to experience life's changes。
We want to experience the resurrection of the Holy Spirit。
We want to shine a light on the world。
But sometimes I think。
we experience these things every summer。
We have to shine a light for God。
We say this every year。
I want to ask you。
Is what you wrote in your letter。
the same as last year?。
Some people may think。
I write the same letter every year。
I said I would go to church this year。
but I didn't。
What is it?。
It seems to be a slogan。
Or maybe in our faith。
there is a situation。
I named it。
This situation。
or we all have a fantasy。
about a summer vacation。
What is it?。
Let Dr. Fung explain。
This is the situation。
When we experience the summer vacation。
we feel like we are back。
We experience the presence of God。
and the changes of life。
We are grateful to God。
Next week we start school。
We start school。
I want to write in this letter。
I must be able to do this。
Then in November。
we enter stage 1。
We are very busy。
I study UT, midterm。
My life is very energetic。
I am exhausted。
I am very tired。
In December and January。
I start exams。
I have a lot to do。
I have to serve。
I can't do this。
I am a little burnt out。
I need to take a break。
We enter stage 2。
Stage 3。
January to June。
At this time。
my life is full of things to do。
The challenge of my faith is getting bigger。
I have a youth leader。
I have a lot to do。
It is like the summer vacation。
has been washed away by the current。
I think that for people with post-traumatic stress disorder。
they usually have a situation。
that before the summer vacation ends。
they will write。
As the care leader said last week。
we want to write a walking bible。
When we walk out。
we tell people what our faith is。
But in the end。
we become a walking dead。
But it is a very funny thing。
Or。
we are grateful to God's leadership。
When we come back next summer。
our walking dead will suddenly。
change us into a human。
and make us a walking bible in our faith。
Brothers and sisters。
I would like to ask you。
In the past few years。
have we been in this cycle?。
Brothers and sisters。
I think our faith life is really endless。
In the new year。
I would like to learn something from you。
We have to be alive in Christ。
Or we have to see。
what we experience in the summer vacation。
When we are going to do it。
we have to have a mindset。
that what we experience。
what we learn to do。
those abilities come from God。
When we learn to do something。
we have to remember that。
God gives us the ability to do what we want。
God controls our life。
so that we can know how to live out。
what we write。
As the Bible says。
the reason why John was able to shine。
was not because of himself。
but because of the presence of Jesus。
and the power of God。
Likewise, our life has to be illuminated。
At least we have to learn one thing。
Our life has to be able to keep alive in Christ。
We have to let this light。
keep shining in our lives。
You know, I think this light。
is not a flash light。
Wow。
I think this light。
is not a flash light in the summer vacation。
This light is a long-lasting spotlight。
to shine on our lives。
Brothers and sisters。
Let's learn together。
What we learn is。
we learn to be alive in Christ。
We don't become a walking dead。
in November。
What we see is。
the light of our lives。
comes from God。
I think this light。
is a constant light that shines on our lives。
Its glory and presence。
are always with our lives。
Likewise, our lives。
are under God's control。
So, are we willing to continue。
learning and doing this?。
This is the first part。
I want to share with you this year。
The second part。
I think this light。
is not just a flash light。
When we look at the Bible。
when John said to rise up。
to restore the rock。
it is not just a moment。
When we look at the Bible。
we see the first verse。
has two verbs。
"to rise up and shine"。
This is a commandment。
It means that the rock。
and the whole nation。
have a mission to respond。
"to rise up and shine"。
In English, it is "arise and shine"。
This word has a similar meaning。
It is like a mother。
calling a sleeping baby。
Likewise, John says。
to awaken a sleeping rock。
"You have to rise up and respond"。
What is the response?。
When we look at the second verse。
there is a link。
In the second verse。
the word "to rise up" is not there。
but in the original text。
there is a word "because"。
It means that John said。
to shine the rock。
there is a reason。
When we look at the third verse。
we see a very important contrast。
It is a big theme。
Light and darkness。
John said that the earth is dark。
and the people are covered by darkness。
This scene is like。
the blindfold game。
where you can't see anything。
The word "darkness"。
also means "death"。
in the Bible。
"No signs"。
"A dead end"。
This is the scene。
that we are trying to imagine。
Everything is dark。
except for a place called Zion。
where there is a sudden glow。
The surrounding area is dark。
and the people are not blind。
They are even covered by darkness。
When we look at this scene。
if you are familiar with the Bible。
you might think of a scene。
When the Egyptians went to Egypt。
to experience the flood。
the land was dark。
Only the houses of the Egyptians。
had light。
It is a similar scene。
But I think Isaiah。
did not just want to express the situation。
In the second verse。
the word "to rise up" is there。
The word is used to。
wake up the people of Zion。
and the readers of the Bible。
What is it saying?。
"Were you not in the darkness before?"。
"Now the Lord is calling you"。
"to appear before you"。
"Since you have come out of the darkness"。
"do not poison the light"。
"You must let the light shine"。
"so that the people of darkness will know"。
"the light of Zion is a thing"。
In the third verse。
when the light is brought out。
what impact will it have?。
The Bible says。
"The kingdom of man will come to save you"。
"The Lord will come to save you"。
What we see is。
the most important goal。
is to let the people of darkness。
know the beauty of light。
We know that Zion。
is a mission。
Likewise。
we see in the third verse。
"Your light and your revelation"。
the word "to rise up" appears again。
I want to say something。
in response to Zion's glory。
and its light。
to attract the people of darkness。
to Zion。
Zion has a mission。
to do this。
This is also a key point。
for Zion to witness God。
Zion has to bring out its light。
The light is not about how bright it is。
or how beautiful the city is。
The light is for the people of darkness。
to let the people of darkness know the light。
and let them know。
the origin of the light。
and what kind of God Jehovah is。
and to share his glory。
Zion is like a lighthouse。
It is the focus of the nation。
to let the nation know。
what the light is。
and to come to worship God。
and to offer up。
This is also what the book of Exodus says。
in chapter 60, verse 3。
It says a lot。
The people of darkness must return。
and offer up。
The people must be reconciled。
and see the hope。
This is what we sing in Exodus 60。
The lyrics。
are about this scene。
It is very special。
Exodus does not describe it clearly。
what kind of light Zion was under。
It only says。
regardless of the light。
Zion must shine。
and let people see hope。
Brothers and sisters。
For us。
for those who are new to the world。
and even for those who are here and now。
this is our mission。
Just like Jesus gave us the great mission。
to shine the light on our door。
I mean, the door of the Lord。
Brothers and sisters。
The focus of the light。
never says。
what kind of light we need to have in our life。
We never need to fulfill。
any criteria to shine the light。
We shine the light。
because we are willing to show。
the beauty of the light in our life。
Just like what Gaga said。
What God is good?。
I forgot what she said。
To let people see。
how great God is。
The Lord said to restore Zion。
and to shine the light for the Lord。
The light is not just about the light。
but to let more people around us。
worship and know the Lord。
I think this mission is very consistent。
When we look at the New Testament。
the disciples in the process of the church。
also shined the light。
to let more foreigners。
and more Jews。
become Christians and worship the Lord。
Let me say more。
Ah。
Back to Hong Kong。
I don't know if you've seen。
the history of Hong Kong。
In the past, Hong Kong was a center for the mission of the Church。
There were many different pastors。
such as Mary Sun。
They brought the light to Hong Kong。
and let many different churches。
come closer to the top。
During the summer vacation this year。
you went to Tuen Xuan。
In the process, we met Elman。
Sarah Wilson。
and Jackie。
I think that whether in Campbell。
Taiwan or Hong Kong。
they are using their lives to shine the light。
to let people see what it is to be a pastor。
I think that these are all true。
I think that these are all true。
For us, we see that。
God uses people from different places。
to let people see the beauty of the light。
Sisters。
In the past, we talked a lot about。
the growth of our lives。
We will continue to do so。
But this year。
I want to take another step forward。
to show everyone。
that faith has a universal nature。
Faith is not just about。
the relationship between ourselves and God。
Faith is not just about。
the relationship between ourselves and the group。
Faith is not just about。
the relationship between ourselves and the group。
Faith is not just about。
the relationship between ourselves and the group。
I think that in Hong Kong。
and in other places around the world。
there are many people。
who are doing the same thing。
Sisters。
Are we willing to。
step out of our comfort zone。
to do the "Let's go and shine" thing。
to let us show off。
in different places。
how bright we are。
and to let people see。
how beautiful the light。
and God in our lives are。
Sisters。
This year's theme is。
"Alive in Christ, Let's go and shine"。
I think that we, as colleagues。
would like to learn this thing together。
I'm not saying that。
when we can do "Alive in Christ"。
our lives will not be challenged。
and our lives will not be exhausted。
We will experience those things。
I'm not saying that。
as a missionary。
I can be alive 365 days a year。
There will be times when I feel exhausted。
But I think that。
when we are in a momentary situation。
our life。
is there a choice。
to continue to seek God?。
Just like what Gaga said。
"The wisdom of the soul"。
Is there a wisdom。
in our lives。
that we can continue to walk like this?。
Sisters, I think that。
this is something that we, as colleagues。
would like to continue to learn together。
"Alive in Christ, Let's go and shine"。
is the call of Isaiah。
When Zion was saved by God。
he had a mission。
to let the light out。
so that the people in darkness。
could see the light and respond to the light。
The Apostles of the Lord。
and the Apostles of the Lord。
are actually moving stones。
to show the light in their lives。
and to let people see it。
Sisters, today。
this plate may have been passed down to us。
Don't think that when you are young。
you think, "No, I still have to take the DSC"。
"Don't, don't care about me"。
"Please forgive him, don't forgive me"。
But sisters。
the mission is the core of our faith。
Let us learn to respond together。
First, learn the first thing。
"Alive in Christ"。
When we experience the transformation of the life of the cross。
don't go to the walking dead in November。
What we see is that。
the light of our life comes from the Lord。
The Lord continues to shine in our lives。
to walk out of the words we have written in the cross。
We have to learn to continue。
like what we said last week。
we have to do a walking bible。
Similarly, when our lives are kept alive。
we should not only be a witness to the light。
but also learn to "Let's go and shine"。
This is a mission that God gave us more than 2,000 years ago。
to let the light shine。
to let people see the beauty of the light。
Indeed, we are also like this。
Some of the elders in the church。
when we go to different places。
we can let people around us see the beauty of the light。
But, sisters, are we willing to see。
that this is what God has given us。
Are we willing to let this become。
what we have been dreaming of and what we have been doing?。
Sisters, I would like to invite you to stand up。
Let's sing a song of repentance。
Sisters, I don't know。
when you go home today。
and see the words you have written in the cross。
I don't know if you have ever thought about it。
What you should think about is。
how you want to implement it in your life。
If you haven't thought about it。
you might be writing the same thing。
when you make a better cross next year。
But let us continue to learn。
to keep our lives alive in Christ。
so that we can take another step。
Let's go and try。
Let's sing a song of repentance。
There is still darkness covering the earth。
There is still darkness covering the people。
There is still a way to wait for you。
There is still darkness covering the earth。
There is still darkness covering the people。
There is still a way to wait for you。
There is still a way to wait for you。
There is still darkness covering the earth。
Let us announce together。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
You always appear to guide me。
The light of the sun never fades away。
Like my feet, they are full of your wisdom, forever。
May the world see the record of your love。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
Your repentance is enough。
You always appear to guide me。
The light of the sun never fades away。
Like my feet, they are full of your wisdom, forever。
May the world see the record of your love。
