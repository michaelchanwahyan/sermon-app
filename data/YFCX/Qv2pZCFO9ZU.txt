Good morning, sisters.。
I think we should give a round of applause to our teachers.。
This is a very good demonstration.。
Is this demonstration the same?。
I think the most touching thing is the new teaching method.。
The teachers have always been…。
I have seen it myself,。
especially last week, I went to Dongguan.。
A few churches there invited me to speak。
about the development, management and education of the church.。
What I told them was that without success, there would be no success.。
But they wanted to know if we could introduce the method to them step by step.。
They even invited our private class.。
This was a few months ago.。
Is it possible to communicate with them?。
They saw that the worship of the Church of God。
was continuously created by many new songs, new verses and new verses.。
Secondly, they really appreciated the new songs and new verses。
brought by the Church of God.。
They were able to prepare the hearts of the people.。
But they didn't see some of the things.。
But they knew that our brothers and sisters went there to help them。
to teach them how to wear the robe,。
to teach them how to wear the robe,。
to teach them how to love their spouse.。
Not all of them went.。
Only our brothers and sisters went.。
Because of this, they were curious to ask,。
"How did you do it?"。
Listen, my brothers and sisters.。
I think everyone knows how to recite the Great Message.。
Do you know how to recite it?。
But whether you know how to interpret the question。
depends on each person.。
I think everyone knows。
that the most important commandment of the Great Message。
is only one commandment.。
That is, "Let the people go as they come."。
How do we do that?。
There are three different ways.。
"Go" means not to wait for people to come.。
"Going" means to go.。
You have to go to every different place.。
You have to go to the place where people are staying.。
You have to find the people。
and bring the Great Message to them.。
But don't give it to them so easily.。
Once you believe, you have to help them wash the dishes.。
You have to warm up their foundation.。
If the foundation is not warmed up,。
they will become a woman.。
The same is true for Christians.。
Why do I believe?。
Unless they have become disciples,。
we will baptize them.。
We will baptize them.。
They will be integrated into the life of the Church。
and become a part of the body.。
But in the body,。
every body has a function.。
Do you agree, Brother Deng?。
If there is anything useless in your body,。
you can cut it off.。
No.。
There is nothing useless.。
"Doctor, I think the ears are ugly.。
Can you cut them off?"。
"The nose is ugly. It's so high.。
Can you cut it off?"。
"My hands are better than my legs.。
My legs are useless.。
Can you cut them off?"。
"What are the nails for?"。
"Why don't you make them all out and make them look better?"。
I tell you,。
it is impossible to cut them off.。
Everything has its function.。
In today's Church,。
we hope that everyone in the Church。
can see that everyone who comes to the Church。
has a function.。
Nothing is useless.。
Everything is very important.。
I have told people many times。
what attracts a newcomer to the Church。
and keeps coming.。
The first impression.。
When they come,。
they look at our Sister Deng.。
Are they very enthusiastic?。
When they come,。
they are very active in meeting and greeting them.。
They never say,。
"Where is your toilet?"。
Then they respond,。
"Go and find it."。
I tell you,。
if you have this attitude,。
they will not come again.。
Unless you say,。
"I will take you there."。
You take them there and bring them back.。
I tell you,。
this impression。
makes them very impressed.。
They will feel that。
they will definitely come back.。
It is not that they decide after hearing the pastor's words.。
It is from the first day of the meeting.。
If you are a person of grace,。
a body,。
you should do your best。
to greet them,。
to treat them,。
to care for them,。
to love them.。
Any brother or sister,。
when they have this need,。
we will immediately,。
for their needs,。
find a suitable person。
at the right time。
to do the right thing。
to help them.。
This is what we should do.。
In the past two weeks,。
the number of people who have asked for help has been increasing.。
A year ago,。
the director of the Chinese Academy of Medicine,。
Dr. Liang Jialun,。
had already contacted me.。
He said that he had opened a new Chinese Academy in Rome.。
In this new Chinese Academy,。
he wanted to teach the Bible.。
Many people could help him.。
Many people could help him teach the Bible.。
But when it comes to the development of the Church,。
the establishment of the Church,。
he thought about it.。
No one could help him.。
So two years ago,。
he told me,。
"Dr. Song,。
can you come?"。
I asked, "How can I come?"。
"You come for half a year."。
This is what their teaching is like.。
They come for half a year.。
After half a year,。
Italy does not allow them to stay for more than half a year.。
They have to leave.。
After they leave,。
they go back again half a year later.。
After they leave, they go back again for half a year.。
I told him,。
"Dr. Liang,。
I have two Chinese Academy.。
I can't leave."。
The first one is the Chinese Academy of Medicine,。
the second one is the Chinese Academy of Medicine,。
I kept mentioning it.。
If you want me to go there for a month in a row,。
I can't do it.。
Because in fact,。
I need to teach。
everything I do.。
I need to teach.。
After he heard it,。
he told me last year,。
"Dr. Song, I know you can't stay for so long,。
but can you open your mind?"。
How to open your mind?。
"You come for 10 days."。
"10 days intensive."。
It means a dense course.。
"Come and help our students."。
Because of this reason,。
two weeks ago,。
I promised him to go to Rome.。
When I went to Rome,。
I didn't just teach in his Chinese Academy.。
He also arranged a nearby。
Roman Chinese Academy.。
But there is a church in Petrova.。
Petrova is。
a train station that is 3.5 to 4 hours away from Rome.。
He said that church is worth helping.。
So I went to Petrova.。
When I went to Petrova,。
I found that this church。
has 300 to 400 people.。
But what I really admire about them。
is that 85% of the people。
are under 40 years old.。
I tell you,。
today, you can't find a church。
in the whole world。
that is so young and energetic.。
Second,。
this church serves。
a businessman,。
an elder,。
no priest,。
all are believers.。
And their believers。
are not only working,。
but also serving in the church.。
But the only problem is。
that there is no one who is always serving them,。
training people to serve.。
Many of them can't make it.。
They are worried that the church will be lost.。
So when I went there,。
a sister told me that。
recently there is a new heaven and earth church.。
Some people invited them to go there.。
She asked, "What is a new heaven and earth church?"。
She saw that they are good people。
and helped this and helped that.。
So she brought some people there.。
When I heard that,。
I was very worried.。
I told her,。
"Do you know what a new heaven and earth church is?"。
"I want to ask you."。
"Do you know what a new heaven and earth church is?"。
"If you know, raise your hand."。
I think we are all just daydreaming.。
The new heaven and earth church。
is the most dangerous。
and even the most evil church in South Korea.。
They said that the new heaven and earth church has already come。
and is in our church.。
So you join our church。
and enjoy the new heaven and earth church.。
When I heard that,。
I was very worried.。
They are so serious。
and so vague.。
But the pastor and the pastor's wife。
don't know what it is.。
Secondly,。
they had two or three churches。
that were very close.。
They went to church and together.。
They all gathered together.。
They all gathered together。
so that they could go to church very soon.。
But since last year,。
there was a church。
and the pastor told them,。
"We will not cooperate with you."。
"You come to our church。
and we come to your church."。
"Because recently,。
there was a member of our church,。
I don't know his name,。
he is very capable。
and he is very capable in healing."。
"After hearing all these,。
he looks like a new believer."。
So I asked them,。
"Do they know how to speak in dialect?"。
They said, "Pastor, how do you know?"。
I told them,。
"The most dangerous movement now。
is the New Testament Movement."。
When I spoke,。
when they heard me,。
they added one more lesson.。
I had already said and done everything.。
The night before I left,。
I had to give them two hours。
to talk to us.。
We need training.。
How do you train us?。
I told my younger sister,。
"After I went to Rome,。
after I went to Dongguan,。
I found that all the problems。
are related to the understanding of the Word of God。
and how to describe the Word of God.。
How do we find a suitable factory。
to train them?"。
When I was in the church,。
I met a group of preachers。
who were preachers in France.。
They had a one-year trial period,。
but it was not enough.。
The church told them,。
"We don't want to continue."。
The group of preachers。
came back to Hong Kong or Malaysia.。
They were in Malaysia,。
but they had been in Hong Kong for six years.。
They went to this church to learn.。
I happened to be there to teach.。
Both of them came.。
After they came,。
they told me。
that the church in their hearts was unhappy。
and that their約 was not yet full.。
They did not want to continue.。
I asked them why.。
They told me that the church was in France.。
In the French church,。
in the meeting,。
one-third of the people。
were French.。
They spoke French.。
The meeting was to teach French to the sisters.。
They all spoke French.。
But none of the preachers。
knew a single French word.。
I asked, "If you don't know French,。
does that mean you don't have a license?"。
They said, "Yes, we don't."。
I asked, "How do you open a meeting?"。
They said, "Someone will translate for you."。
"You go to visit people,。
but you don't know how to drive a car.。
How do you go?"。
They said, "Someone will drive you."。
I realized that if that was the case,。
you would be blind,。
and you wouldn't be able to see French.。
You would be deaf, and you wouldn't be able to hear French.。
You would be mute, and you wouldn't be able to speak French.。
You would be deaf.。
I told them,。
"Brother,。
I don't think you should blame the church,。
but you should blame your missionary organization.。
When our missionaries join the OMF,。
they need to learn the language for at least two years.。
After learning, they need to pass the test,。
and then they can go to the factory.。
How can you do that so quickly?"。
I told them,。
"I encourage you to think about。
using your own language。
to serve in the places you go to.。
Don't waste your time.。
It's not worth it."。
Dear brothers and sisters,。
today I am here to talk about。
the importance of "the living and the dying."。
Let's take a look at this PowerPoint.。
1 Timothy 2, 1-6.。
I would like to show you。
how the Bible uses this great mission。
in their actual lives.。
Let's read together.。
"I tell you,。
you must be strong in the one side of Jesus Christ.。
You must hear my teaching in front of many witnesses.。
You must be faithful and faithful。
to be able to teach others."。
This is the Bible.。
You can see。
that the most important thing is the living and the dying.。
Paul explains it very clearly.。
He tells Timothy,。
"Timothy, you must be strong in the one side of Jesus Christ."。
If you pay attention,。
both the later and earlier books of Timothy。
are very personal books。
especially given to Paul and Suleiman.。
One of the sons is Timothy,。
and the other is Tithon.。
But these two books are different.。
The content of the books。
is very different from that of Tithon and Timothy.。
The tone of the words is also different.。
Why?。
Because it is very simple.。
Paul knew these two sons.。
He even knew their personalities.。
Timothy was a good boy.。
Timothy was a relatively weak person.。
He was introverted.。
He grew up in a Christian family.。
But the problem was that he had not gone through the storm.。
Because of this reason,。
what did he need most?。
He saw him.。
What you need most is actual experience.。
The appearance you get from your mother's faith。
is completely correct.。
But is it enough?。
Paul tells him, "You are not strong."。
Because of this,。
when he saw this family living for a very short time,。
he felt their bottom.。
What is the bottom?。
It is not just social relations.。
"Have you eaten?"。
"Good morning."。
"How are you?"。
"I am fine."。
No.。
It is not even a deep relationship.。
A deep relationship means。
that you know the deep things in your heart.。
You know how their original family is.。
Paul had to enter the spiritual realm.。
In our group today,。
I want to tell you。
not to pretend。
that no one knows your original family.。
Your struggle,。
your struggle in the spiritual realm,。
we have to enter the spiritual realm.。
We have to use the words of God,。
our experience,。
the experience of some brothers and sisters,。
and the experience of the ancestors.。
We have to encourage each other.。
This is what we have to do today.。
So we can see clearly here。
that Paul is applying the Great Mission.。
Go.。
Go to this home.。
Then put the needs of this home。
in your heart.。
Then, based on the needs he knows,。
based on the different people,。
give different instructions.。
This is why。
after following Paul,。
there was a great experience.。
In the church of Philippians,。
after he drove away the demons,。
he was persecuted and imprisoned.。
Throughout the whole process,。
from beginning to end, he was persecuted.。
How did Paul meet the Lord in prison?。
The Lord knew.。
Today, I will first show you。
Paul's attitude towards the Lord。
in the "The Message of the New Life"。
He said to the Lord,。
"Lord,。
I am your son.。
You must know。
that you have to listen to what I teach。
in front of many witnesses.。
You must also teach those who are faithful and can teach others."。
There are four generations of hermits here.。
Paul was the first generation.。
Timothy was the second generation.。
Those who are faithful and can teach others。
were the third generation.。
Then there were others, the fourth generation.。
They must be in the fire of the Lord.。
I am very grateful to see our disciples today.。
They have the fire of the Lord.。
How did the masters come?。
Through training.。
The Bible says。
that our patriarchs did the same thing.。
Every year,。
a shepherd would come with me.。
Or a pair of shepherds would come with me.。
After the shepherd,。
the next would be the patriarch.。
After the patriarch,。
the new life,。
the "re-education of values" would come.。
These people came out。
and became members of the group.。
Can we divide into two groups?。
Can we divide into four groups?。
We kept dividing。
until we had soldiers to use.。
Dear brothers and sisters,。
the patriarchs were like this.。
Three groups.。
What happened?。
We had three groups of leaders.。
We had a deputy leader.。
Then we had a team.。
One more thing,。
the disciples.。
In the past,。
we had this arrangement.。
Every person in the three groups。
had two or three disciples。
to preach for them.。
After preaching, you would be the leader.。
What was the purpose of the disciples?。
The purpose was to become members of the three groups.。
After being members,。
they would be on the team.。
Then they would be deputy leaders.。
Then they would be leaders.。
The new life.。
You may ask,。
"Why is that?"。
Because it's very simple.。
The disciples had experienced it.。
In the past, we didn't have this arrangement.。
What was the result?。
Let's look at the 18th chapter of the Book of Genesis.。
This chapter left a deep impression on me.。
It was around 32 years ago.。
32 years ago, in 1992 or 1991,。
we decided to form a small group to lead the church.。
The main reason was。
that we had 100 disciples at the beginning.。
In the second year, we had more than 200 disciples.。
In the third year, we had 300 or 400 disciples.。
But at that time,。
there were only two preachers.。
How could we raise so many people?。
Moreover,。
the people of the Holy See were very good at choosing.。
They would find a deputy leader.。
They would find someone from the Hong Kong TV station,。
meaning the Hong Kong TV station,。
who was the most helpful to us.。
They would find him.。
So I invited two preachers to find me.。
I invited four preachers.。
They found me again.。
The result was。
exactly the same as Moses' experience.。
His father told him,。
"Moses, you can't do it like this.。
One by one, they are lining up to find you,。
to break up the discipline.。
What is the result?。
How many disciples do you have?。
Two million.。
You have to find thousands of people.。
You have to line up.。
Why do you have to line up?。
Because it's not your turn yet.。
Moses was the only one to be a deputy leader,。
to arrange and break up the discipline.。
So he was lining up from morning to night.。
Moses had to be a deputy leader from morning to night,。
to do all kinds of different things.。
His father told him,。
"The result of your doing this,。
first, you will burn out.。
Second, the people will rush out.。
Third, sooner or later, everyone will die out."。
After I saw Moses,。
I had a very deep impression.。
It was because of this that I reminded myself,。
"So, Moses,。
do you want to be the only one acting,。
and the rest of the people watching,。
and the result of your doing this,。
you will burn out,。
and the rest of the people will rush out?。
In the end,。
all the people in the assembly,。
including you,。
will all die out?"。
I was in agony.。
I decided to do one thing.。
I decided to group up the whole church.。
I formed a small group to share the burden.。
I gathered my strength.。
The church members gathered their strength。
to form a group.。
Once the group was formed,。
the group leader would lead the group.。
The group leader would lead the group.。
First,。
the first group to benefit from this。
was the church members themselves.。
Some say, "Learning is not enough."。
But what we actually see is,。
"Teaching is not enough."。
When we go to preach,。
when we form a group,。
we see where we are lacking.。
You go to read,。
you go to write,。
you go to listen,。
and even when you are pre-studying,。
when the church leaders are doing the pre-study,。
you will be distracted.。
You won't be sleeping.。
You will be writing everything down.。
The reason is that you need to form a group.。
Dear brothers and sisters,。
have you seen your responsibilities?。
Your children,。
your families,。
your grandchildren.。
Recently, I received a message from a brother,。
Wallace, who is a member of the "Patriarchal Family."。
And his wife.。
When they returned to the US,。
their eldest grandson came to check.。
He was diagnosed with a blood clot.。
Then, their eldest grandson, eldest son, and eldest granddaughter。
came to check their values.。
Then, they went to several different churches。
to help them form a group.。
I felt "Hallelujah" in my heart.。
I was filled with gratitude for this brother.。
Also, he helped us to watch over the owner of the building.。
I don't know if you have seen that video.。
He said, "I am your descendant."。
Why?。
"I am the disciple of Bass."。
Bass, the elder, can you stand up?。
Let's give Bass a round of applause.。
Bass, please stand up.。
When Bass was working for the government,。
this owner, Kwong Ching Wai,。
was his subordinate.。
He was an official.。
He went to check on Wai Cheng's estate.。
When he arrived, he was very concerned about him.。
Why did he have so many worries?。
He started to drink with his whole family.。
In order to make Wai Cheng believe him,。
he said, "I believe you."。
It was just a cover-up.。
But he did not let go of this cover-up.。
He said, "You have been here once.。
You said you believed me.。
Why don't you go to his church with my master?"。
Where was the church?。
It was in the side of Fang Fang,。
in the Yin Fu Tang.。
He came for the first time.。
When he came for the first time,。
he just said, "The 10th and 6th precepts are that one cannot kill."。
"That's great!"。
Wai Cheng said that.。
I don't want to say it again.。
But I was very touched.。
This brother, Kwong Ching Wai,。
after learning the "One Drop of Blood",。
he went back to the U.S. Embassy in Singapore.。
He started to lead the group from that time.。
He led the group in doing business,。
in doing everything.。
He led the group in the elders.。
Until now,。
he has not changed.。
He leads a few,。
a dozen "One Drop of Blood" groups every year.。
I am very grateful.。
This brother is a faithful person.。
Now, let's see。
how we can spread the gospel.。
First, we need to study.。
Study is,。
as long as Paul teaches,。
you need to teach those who are faithful and can teach others.。
You need to find suitable people to teach them.。
Until everything I teach you,。
you tell them everything.。
But is it enough?。
No.。
Finally, let's look at the 3rd precept.。
It's not just about preaching.。
From the 3rd precept to the 6th precept,。
the subject is too exaggerated.。
Let's read it together.。
You must be like me.。
Next page, please.。
Yes, I will read it together.。
You must be like me,。
suffer together,。
as a Christian soldier of Jesus.。
Those who are in the army。
cannot be arrogant.。
It is better to let the people in the army be happy.。
When the athletes are competing,。
they cannot be proud of their ability,。
but they must be hard-working.。
Let me tell you,。
preaching is absolutely necessary.。
In Timothy's family,。
his mother and his grandmother。
were very important to him.。
He saw the faith in his mother and grandmother.。
What is this faith?。
It is not hypocritical at all.。
What did he believe?。
What did he do?。
What did he say?。
What did he do?。
This is the example of his mother and grandmother.。
So the word "inconsistency"。
is not a hypocrisy.。
It is not a big talk.。
It is something that can be said and done.。
Dear brothers and sisters,。
you must know that。
your children,。
your grandchildren,。
they are always against。
the students who do not believe.。
Secondly, they are against the teachers who do not believe.。
How can you influence them?。
By church?。
They come to church for one, one hour, two hours a week.。
Can you change their past?。
Absolutely not.。
How can you influence them?。
It depends on how you treat them at home.。
If they see that you are very different from others,。
from the aunties and uncles that they know,。
I tell them,。
"It is very difficult for you to make them not believe in our Lord."。
I have seen it. I have shared it with my friends.。
I have been to my friends' homes.。
"Wow, they are all rude when they eat."。
"Dad is rude."。
"Mom is rude too."。
Then the children take their food and go to the TV.。
They have nothing to talk about.。
When they go to drink tea, they take a newspaper.。
They don't talk at all.。
But we are not like that.。
We don't break our fingers.。
They feel very different.。
Then their classmates come to our home.。
I tell them, "Your home is very strange."。
They ask, "How is it strange?"。
"Why do you all hold hands and pray?"。
"When you eat, you give me food, I give you food."。
"Why are you so busy?"。
"That is love."。
But he said,。
"I like your home very much."。
He likes our home.。
I am very grateful.。
His classmates.。
Many of them came to our church.。
They are all men.。
Why?。
Because they saw。
something that his home did not have.。
Something that he did not have.。
Something that he did not care about.。
Dear brothers and sisters,。
don't think that when we are at home,。
you are like this.。
You don't say anything, you don't do anything.。
Your son or daughter will become a believer.。
And become a disciple.。
That is impossible.。
Unless we are in the Church of the New Testament and the Church of the Old Testament,。
we are allowed to see that we are living。
and that is what we believe.。
We are living what we believe.。
We are attracted to it.。
Listen to my sermon.。
Let's try to see.。
Paul was like this.。
Thimolthi was like this.。
Let's come and see.。
In the New Testament, Paul told him,。
"You will suffer with me."。
Don't think that if you believe, you will be a believer.。
No.。
Then Thimolthi thought of how Paul was imprisoned.。
One by one, he cried and cried.。
He was very unhappy.。
But when Paul entered the prison,。
he preached, sang, and praised God.。
He was beaten up by more than 40 people.。
They took off their clothes and came to beat him.。
After the beating, they put the two legs of the wooden dog on the metal chain.。
They tied them up.。
But what did they do when they entered?。
They sang, preached, and praised God.。
I want to ask you.。
They took off their clothes, beat him,。
and then they were put in the prison.。
They were very heavy prisoners.。
They were locked up.。
If you were in there, would you preach?。
Most people would.。
What did you preach?。
"Lord, you have sinned against me."。
"People in your world have come to wrong me."。
"Punish them."。
Is this how you preach?。
"Let me get out of here quickly."。
Is this how you preach?。
No.。
Second, you sang.。
Can you sing?。
Third, you praised God.。
Can you praise God?。
I believe that when you are in there,。
it is easier to pray to God.。
It is very difficult to praise God.。
But Paul, the prisoner of Syria,。
was locked up like this.。
What was the result?。
The whole prison was full of prisoners.。
It was shocking.。
Why were these two prisoners locked up so easily?。
So everyone was questioning what they were singing and preaching.。
Then God performed a miracle.。
The doors were broken.。
The iron chains were broken.。
But no one died.。
Think about it.。
How many earthquakes。
would shake your watch to the ground?。
Can you think about it?。
How many earthquakes?。
Not even ten.。
If you were broken,。
your watch would shake.。
I am sure it was not an earthquake.。
It was a miracle.。
And at this miracle,。
the prison warden fell asleep.。
It was a big problem.。
When he woke up, he realized that he could not be saved.。
He could not go back.。
He wanted to die.。
What did Paul do?。
Today, we will look at。
how deeply the faith that can be seen。
was affected.。
First, the faith that can be seen.。
Paul saw the body of the man.。
He asked people to throw stones at him.。
But he prayed,。
"Don't give them the sin."。
Then he fell asleep.。
Second, he saw the Lord's resurrection.。
He showed it to him.。
The 15th chapter of the Gospels,。
the 8th chapter begins.。
He saw it with his own eyes.。
Third,。
the 14th chapter of the Book of Mormon.。
He experienced it himself.。
He was beaten with stones.。
People thought he was dead.。
He was dragged out of the city.。
But he woke up.。
When he woke up,。
he did not run away so quickly.。
He entered the city again.。
Look at him.。
He entered the city again.。
What did he do?。
He preached.。
Then,。
the 16th chapter of the Book of Mormon.。
This is the case of being wronged.。
After the miracle happened,。
the man wanted to commit suicide.。
I think as a prison guard,。
when you saw him taking a knife to commit suicide,。
you would not say a word.。
You would watch him die.。
Then you would leave.。
Would you?。
You would watch him die.。
You would watch him die.。
After he died,。
you would leave.。
But Paul did not.。
He shouted,。
"Do not die!"。
"We are all here!"。
He said this。
to the prison guard.。
"I do not want you to die."。
"I would rather die."。
Because this prisoner。
could be executed at any time.。
He was in a prison cell.。
There was no chance to make a statement at that time.。
He could do whatever he wanted.。
But Paul,。
he was shouting for him.。
The prison guard,。
at that time,。
could not explain。
why there was such a prison guard.。
"You could have watched me die."。
"Why did you shout for me?"。
He was surprised.。
So he asked,。
"How can I be saved?"。
Paul told him,。
"When you believe in Jesus Christ,。
you and your family will be saved."。
So, because of this reason,。
the prison guard believed in Jesus Christ,。
so he took him out。
and brought him home.。
He served them food,。
washed their feet,。
and was also washed.。
The whole family was washed.。
"Are you sure you will die?"。
"The authorities are coming to find you."。
"Why are two heavy prisoners missing?"。
"One is called Paul, the other is called Sarah."。
"They went to the prison guard's house."。
"When the high priest saw this,。
he let these two prisoners go to your house."。
He believed in Jesus Christ.。
He served them food,。
washed their feet,。
and did everything.。
Some people believe。
that death is inevitable,。
and the whole family may be excommunicated.。
But the Bible says in chapter 34,。
let's read it together.。
"Then the prison guard took them to his house,。
and put them on a table,。
and he and his family were filled with joy."。
They were filled with joy.。
From a person who was afraid of death,。
who wanted to die,。
who wanted to commit suicide,。
and to change,。
they became filled with joy.。
Why?。
Because they had seen the truth.。
Jesus Christ is the Lord of Resurrection.。
Why should I be afraid?。
Since what I did was right,。
why should I be afraid?。
The two prisoners were still there.。
I can tell them what happened。
as a witness.。
On the other hand,。
how did Paul see his own departure?。
In the book of Timothy, chapter 4, verse 7-8,。
"He took a book and placed it on his son,。
and said to him, 'What is it?'。
'Let us read together.'。
'I have already fought the battle,。
and I have already gone all the way,。
and I have already kept the way I believe.'。
'From now on, I will be known as a righteous man.'。
'On the day the Lord of Justice comes,。
He will bestow upon me,。
not only upon me,。
but also upon all those who love Him.'"。
What does death mean?。
Death is the award of a class president.。
To each of us who follows the Lord today,。
to the whole world,。
death is the award of a class president。
after the sports race.。
Who is the winner?。
Who is the winner?。
Paul said,。
"If I follow the Lord my whole life,。
I will be in front of God,。
in the Lord's hands,。
and receive the champion's award."。
He will receive the title of the winner.。
After visiting Rome,。
I saw many things。
that can be seen in the faith.。
I saw the influence of the faith。
Let me show you.。
This time,。
when I was not teaching,。
I had a section every day,。
for two to three hours.。
Someone took us to Rome.。
What did we visit?。
Some churches.。
They prepared for us。
some commemorative信徒.。
The first one was。
the place where Peter the Great was persecuted.。
I went to this place.。
There were three floors of earthen houses.。
The first floor.。
The second floor.。
The third floor.。
It was very dark.。
The most unforgettable thing in my heart。
was this pillar.。
It was written on this pillar。
that Paul was on this pillar.。
I think he was made out of it.。
It was a completely identical pillar.。
It was where he was beheaded.。
There was a painting。
about Paul's faith.。
It also mentioned Peter's cross。
was shown in that place.。
After that,。
I saw that there was a document。
not only in Italian,。
but also in English,。
which was written in that place.。
This church commemorated。
Paul and Peter's faith.。
I went to another church。
to commemorate a Roman Caesar。
named Cleopatra.。
In the early 4th century,。
she killed 10,203 Roman soldiers.。
Why did she kill so many soldiers?。
Because these soldiers。
did not listen to Caesar。
when he was killing the Christians.。
They would rather I die。
than kill the Christians.。
They were innocent.。
That is why they were killed.。
I never thought that。
after the Great Emperor was killed,。
the next one to come was Constantine.。
He changed the whole of Rome。
to become a Christian country.。
Why did he do that?。
Why did he change?。
He saw some unchangeable facts.。
The number of Christians who died。
was 100,000.。
What he believed was the true historical facts.。
What they believed was the truth.。
How did Paul go to jail?。
In Philippians 4, verse 22,。
he even said this。
when he was in jail.。
Let's read it together.。
"The apostles and the saints asked you for your safety.。
The people of Caesar。
asked you for your safety."。
He specifically said。
that in this place of Philippi,。
the people of Caesar。
asked you for your safety.。
We will ask today,。
why did the people of Caesar。
ask the apostles for their safety?。
Unless someone in Caesar believed.。
It turned out that Constantine's faith。
came from his mother.。
Where did his mother's faith come from?。
It must have been passed down to him by the Christians.。
How did the Christians pass it down?。
It must have been passed down when he was in jail.。
I am here to offer this testimony.。
We can see。
that what Paul established。
was a model of living in the flesh.。
The model of the Antiochian Church,。
the education of the Holy Scripture,。
was the most important.。
It was in the Church,。
by the Church,。
and for the Church.。
It was established in the Church,。
by the Church,。
and for the Church.。
In other words,。
the Holy Scripture education。
is closely related to the Church.。
Let's watch a video。
and prepare our hearts.。
Many of our brothers and sisters in the Church。
have received the equipment。
and returned to the Church to serve.。
We are grateful to them.。
I hope we can。
study the Holy Scripture at any time, any place.。
"Live to learn, live to use, build a door to the world."。
"The whole world will be at your feet."。
"The whole world will be at your feet."。
I went to Rome。
to help the Italian Catholic Church。
that was established by Fr. Giancarlo Lungarum.。
It was a Christian Catholic Church.。
I came to help them.。
On the other hand,。
we see that the whole world。
is becoming more and more。
rich in equipment。
before the Lord comes.。
I hope that the brothers and sisters in the Church。
can cherish this opportunity。
to seize the opportunity.。
Our own Church has the Holy Scripture.。
We can study more and more。
and equip ourselves.。
May God bless you.。
