[Pause]。
Hello. Okay. Good morning, brothers and sisters.。
[Cantonese]。
I'm very excited. I'm very happy to be here.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, my wife and my son, they are very happy to be here among you.。
[Cantonese]。
This morning, when I came to the church, this church, also when I entered the door,。
I felt like I'm in my family.。
[Cantonese]。
I think this is very important because we are far away from our country, our home,。
maybe 10,000 kilometers, but still we are feeling like in the same family.。
[Pause]。
Yes, thank you.。
[Cantonese]。
Yeah. Sorry. Which?。
[Pause]。
Okay. Okay. Yeah, I am Ozan.。
My family and my wife, Esen, my son is Yalan.。
We are coming from Turkey. Also, we are coming from Muslim background.。
[Cantonese]。
I came to faith 17 years ago.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, my wife and I, we are joining the same church for 17 years.。
[Cantonese]。
Our church is the local church, the biggest and also the first local church in Turkey.。
[Cantonese]。
We are serving in our church. Also, I am serving one Christian organization as a full-time worker, as a staff.。
[Cantonese]。
We are trying to reach people to share the gospel and share the God's love to people,。
especially young people in Turkey.。
[Cantonese]。
It's not easy, I know, because Turkey population is 85 million people.。
[Cantonese]。
But just 20,000 Christians, 20,000 believers in Turkey.。
[Cantonese]。
That's why we have a lot of work. We have a lot of work to reach people, to share the gospel, to make a discipleship in Turkey.。
[Cantonese]。
As I said, I feel very happy to be here, to be among you, because you know thousands of churches in the world,。
but at the same time, there is one church in the world.。
[Cantonese]。
We are members of that church, that one church.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, we worship the same God. Also, we say as father, the same God, as the same father.。
[Cantonese]。
That's why, thank you so much. You make us feel we are in the same family.。
[Cantonese]。
This is my third time in Hong Kong. I always told my wife and my son, I love Hong Kong, I love Hong Kong brothers and sisters.。
Their faith are very strong, they are powerful in the faith.。
[Cantonese]。
They always say, "Oh, okay, okay, why Ozan said like this, why Ozan said that?"。
But that time, we came as a family to Hong Kong, and they felt like me, the same thing, same feelings.。
[Cantonese]。
For example, today, it was maybe 10 minutes, but this 10 minutes is very important for us,。
because they felt like we are in family, same family, even my son.。
[Cantonese]。
Yeah, the Turkey is 85 million people live in Turkey, 99% Muslim people.。
[Cantonese]。
25%?。
99%.。
99%, oh, 99% are Muslim.。
You can, yes, you can see.。
Yeah, but there were many Christians in this land, in Turkey.。
[Cantonese]。
Many Christians, you know, from the screen, 19, 20, 27, no, 19, 14, 25% Christians in Turkey before.。
[Cantonese]。
But now, it's too less, too few, just 20,000 people.。
[Cantonese]。
But we want to revival in Turkey, in our country.。
[Cantonese]。
We want to revival come to Turkey again.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, we want to rebuild destroyed walls in Turkey.。
[Cantonese]。
We want to rebuild destroyed walls Church of Turkey again.。
[Cantonese]。
As you know from the Nehemiah.。
[Cantonese]。
Nehemiah wanted to rebuild destroyed walls of Jerusalem.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, we want this same thing in Turkey, Church of Turkey.。
We want to rebuild destroyed walls Church of Turkey.。
[Cantonese]。
You know, this one?。
Okay, as you know from the Bible, Turkey has a very important place for history of the Christianity.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, you know from Abraham, city of Haran, can you see?。
[Cantonese]。
Haran, Antioch, Cappadocia.。
We know from Bible, this place. Also, Abraham and his family lived in Haran.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, mountain Ararat is very important place in the Bible. Noah's Ark landed in mountain Ararat.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, Hittite civilization, they are very dominant civilization in Turkey in this land before.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, you know from the New Testament, most of Jesus disciples spent their gospel journey in Turkey, in this land.。
[Cantonese]。
When we look at the Acts in the Bible, many Christian communities planted this place, this area.。
[Cantonese]。
Also Ephesus, Colossae and Galatia are towns and regions in Turkey.。
[Cantonese]。
You know Apostle Paul, he was born in Tarsus.。
[Cantonese]。
Most of his ministry was in Tarsus, in this land.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, the seven churches is very important in the Revelation.。
You can see from the map, Pergamon, Smyrna, Ephesus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.。
[Cantonese]。
Lots of place from the Bible.。
[Cantonese]。
That's why we want to come to revival in Turkey again, like before.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, the other important place is Cappadocia. You know Cappadocia from the Bible? This is very, very important place.。
[Cantonese]。
After persecution, the Christian people went to escape to Cappadocia place, this place you can see.。
[Cantonese]。
If you go to Cappadocia, you can see, you can visit many underground cities in Cappadocia.。
[Cantonese]。
These cities built by the first believers, first Christians.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, you can see many Bible motifs on the walls in cave.。
[Cantonese]。
Also, Antioch. Antioch is very important in Christianity, for Christianity. Also, Turkey, maybe you heard before, there was an earthquake, very big earthquake in Antioch, in Turkey.。
[Cantonese]。
Modern name is Antakya.。
[Cantonese]。
Ancient church destroyed, but spiritual church will be stronger than before. Kingdom of God will come again to Antioch.。
[Cantonese]。
Many buildings collapsed, destroyed, many people escaped from Antioch.。
[Cantonese]。
But we want to rebuild again in Antioch, but not just building, we want to rebuild spiritually.。
[Cantonese]。
As I said, we are coming from Izmir, Smyrna.。
[Cantonese]。
The Bible says about Smyrna church in the Revelation book called Faithful Church. Smyrna is Faithful Church.。
[Cantonese]。
I can say this, Smyrna Church is still Faithful.。
[Cantonese]。
Smyrna Church is reflecting God's love to people in Turkey, in Izmir.。
[Cantonese]。
You know from the Revelation 2, 8, 11.。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
Brothers and sisters, we want to raise the church up with your prayers.。
[Cantonese]。
I want to encourage you to pray for Turkey, pray for Middle East.。
[Cantonese]。
Because it's hurt my heart because there were many Christians in my country, in my land.。
But now, just 20,000 people.。
[Cantonese]。
God's unique love must reach again in Turkey.。
[Cantonese]。
May the seven churches arise again in Turkey.。
[Cantonese]。
May the seven churches rise again in order to Kingdom of God come to Turkey again.。
[Cantonese]。
And may the church in this land be stronger and greater than before.。
[Cantonese]。
Maybe I can read Psalms 24, 7, 10.。
[Cantonese]。
This time I can read, English?。
Yeah.。
I don't know Cantonese.。
I will translate to Chinese.。
Lift up your heads, you gates, be lift up, you ancient doors, that the King of Glory may come in.。
Who is this King of Glory?。
The Lord is strong and mighty.。
The Lord is mighty in battle.。
Lift up your heads, you gates, lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of Glory may come in.。
Who is He?。
This King of Glory.。
The Lord Almighty, He is the King of Glory.。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
In Turkey, to be Christian, it's not easy. It's difficult.。
[Cantonese]。
There are social pressure from your families, from relatives, from job, friends, from everywhere.。
[Cantonese]。
You have to pay many costs from your life.。
[Cantonese]。
If you come to Jesus in Turkey, you may lost everything in your life.。
[Cantonese]。
Sometimes it's very difficult to walk with God.。
[Cantonese]。
Even you may lost your identity.。
[Cantonese]。
Because if you say to people, I was Muslim before, but now I am a Christian, they are looking you very weird, very strange.。
[Cantonese]。
As I said, I am coming from a Muslim background. My whole family, my whole relatives are Muslim. Just I am a Christian in my family.。
[Cantonese]。
I came to Jesus through two dreams.。
[Cantonese]。
The dreams are too long, but long story of short, I can say, maybe you heard before, in the Middle East, God speak people through dreams.。
Like me.。
[Cantonese]。
My first dream, God touch my back and I got healed and I asked to sky, who is this hand?。
[Cantonese]。
Sorry.。
Who is this hand?。
[Cantonese]。
And the majestic voice said, this hand coming from David's descendant.。
David's descendant.。
[Cantonese]。
But,。
[Cantonese]。
But when I woke up, I was shocked because I didn't know who is David.。
[Cantonese]。
I didn't know Jesus descended. Who is Jesus, where is coming from Jesus?。
[Cantonese]。
In my second dream, that time we were just friend, my wife in university and we were walking on the flat area.。
When we were walking, the big mountain appeared in front of us.。
[Cantonese]。
The big mountain.。
[Cantonese]。
And she said, we have to climb this mountain. I said, no we cannot do that because no one has been able to climb this mountain.。
[Cantonese]。
When we were discussing, the man who is coming from the sky, he said, Ozan and Esen, I will suffer for you and I will reach top of the mountain for you.。
[Cantonese]。
And after that, Jesus climbed the mountain. There were many details but I am passing details.。
When Jesus reached top of the mountain, the mountain suddenly disappeared.。
[Cantonese]。
In my dream, I was shocked because no one has been able to climb this mountain but Jesus did. And I said, how could Jesus do that?。
[Cantonese]。
And after that, I woke up, three days later, middle of night, I said, okay Jesus, I accept you, I believe you, you are my savior.。
[Cantonese]。
And then I came to Jesus, 20 years old and I graduated. But that time, I thought that, oh, my life will be very nice, very good, I will be a powerful Christian.。
[Cantonese]。
I graduated university, I went back to my parents' house.。
[Cantonese]。
But every Sunday, I tried to go to church.。
[Cantonese]。
And one day, I went to church and come back to home and my father asked me, where did you go today?。
[Cantonese]。
I said, I went to, I met with my friends, just friends.。
[Cantonese]。
But he asked again. Normally, my father never asks two times. But that time, he asked me, where did you go today?。
[Cantonese]。
And this time, I said, I went to church.。
[Cantonese]。
He said, asked me, why did you go to church?。
[Cantonese]。
I said, church is very beautiful place, I love Christian people, they are very friendly, they love me.。
[Cantonese]。
And after that, he started to say bad things to Christian people, and church, and Christianity.。
[Cantonese]。
I said, why do you say bad things to Christian? Because I know them, I know church, I know Christianity, I know brothers and sisters, I felt love from them.。
[Cantonese]。
But my father was getting very angry.。
[Cantonese]。
And I realized that, when my father said bad things to Christianity, I realized that I defend my brothers and sisters, also church.。
[Cantonese]。
But I was just six months believer, I didn't know many things about Christianity, many things about Jesus, but I know Jesus changed my life.。
[Cantonese]。
In my first dream, Jesus touched me, God touched me, and I got healed physically, but I know Jesus changed my life, and Jesus gave me spiritual healing.。
[Cantonese]。
We were discussing, it's very, very strong, my father was getting angry, and my mother, my sister, they were crying, they were saying bad things.。
[Cantonese]。
And after three hours, my father, he came to my, near my knee, and he said like this, "You have to choose right now, me or Jesus."。
[Cantonese]。
It was very difficult, because as I said, I didn't know many things, but also, I had a very nice childhood, I felt love from my family, I love them so much.。
[Cantonese]。
But that time, it was very difficult, when I remember this time, I also feel like very sad. But in this time, I said to my father,。
"I don't want to choose right now, because I love you, and I know you love me."。
[Cantonese]。
But he said, "You have to choose right now."。
[Cantonese]。
And I said, "Okay, father, okay, I choose Jesus."。
[Cantonese]。
The most difficult decision for me.。
[Cantonese]。
Because I love, you love family, right?。
[Cantonese]。
Family, your family loves you, you know, you feel.。
[Cantonese]。
But that time, I believed that I have to choose Jesus.。
[Cantonese]。
And my father looked my eyes and he said, "Okay, you are not my son, you have to go from my home, this is my home."。
[Cantonese]。
I was crying and said, "How can I go? Where can I go? I had no money, zero, I had no job."。
[Cantonese]。
But he said, "You have to go from my home, because this is my home, you cannot stay here."。
[Cantonese]。
My mom and my sister were crying, and I took my bag and I went out from the home.。
[Cantonese]。
I was crying, I had no money because the time is 11pm, 11-12pm.。
[Cantonese]。
I was very angry to God because I said, "I choose Jesus you, but I lost my family."。
[Cantonese]。
I saw many miracles in my life from God.。
[Cantonese]。
Some miracles I cannot remember, but there is one miracle I cannot forget.。
[Cantonese]。
First miracle from God in my life, first miracle.。
[Cantonese]。
I took my bag and I went out from home, I was crying because I had no money, nothing.。
When I was praying and also when I was crying, I opened my eyes and I found very, very small Turkish tailor on the ground.。
[Cantonese]。
This detail is very important for me, also for God I know.。
Just this small tailor, just was enough to use one-way train.。
[Cantonese]。
Not for return ticket, just one way.。
[Cantonese]。
I put my card and I went to my Christian brother's house.。
[Cantonese]。
I stayed with them three months.。
[Cantonese]。
Also I joined the church, I joined youth group, my brothers and sisters take care of me.。
[Cantonese]。
My parents didn't talk with me five years, they didn't connect with me, also they didn't come to our wedding.。
[Cantonese]。
I tried to speak with them but they don't want to do connection with me.。
[Cantonese]。
But when I started to speak, I said to you, if you come to Jesus, you may lose many things from your life.。
[Cantonese]。
But at the same time, when you come to Jesus in Turkey, God gives to you new brothers and new sisters, also new family.。
[Cantonese]。
Like you, even you are far away from your country, thousands of kilometers, you may feel like in same family, your brothers and sisters like you.。
[Cantonese]。
That's why I said you, I'm feeling like in my family with you, among you.。
[Cantonese]。
Also Jesus gives to you new identity.。
[Cantonese]。
Also this identity cannot be changed, cannot be lost because this is coming from the heaven, coming from the God.。
[Cantonese]。
As I said you, as I told you, we are coming from Muslim background, but also Esen and I, my wife and I are attending same church for 17 years.。
[Cantonese]。
Our church has 250 members, local Turkish.。
[Cantonese]。
I encourage you, if you come to Turkey, if you come to our church, when you speak people, when you talk with people, you can hear lots of miracles from God.。
[Cantonese]。
I'm just one of them, just me.。
[Cantonese]。
But if you talk with other members of church, you will find more miracles happening to you.。
[Cantonese]。
God is doing many, many miracles in Turkey, in Izmir.。
[Cantonese]。
Our church planted more than 40 years ago.。
[Cantonese]。
Old building was under the apartment.。
[Cantonese]。
Has been subjected to many pressures from, in the past, from the government, from the different faith groups.。
[Cantonese]。
Even from my father.。
[Cantonese]。
After my family reject me, my father came to church.。
[Cantonese]。
And middle of the sermon, he stopped the sermon, and he said bad things.。
[Cantonese]。
And he said, you steal my son, I will complain you to government, complain to police.。
[Cantonese]。
Despite all things, our church stay faithful.。
[Cantonese]。
It was closed many times in the past, many times oppressed by the police, and slandered by the people.。
[Cantonese]。
Like in the revolution, still is faithful.。
[Cantonese]。
25 years, our church met in this building, under the apartment.。
[Cantonese]。
25 years, but it's not too big, it was not too big.。
[Cantonese]。
But our numbers, the people's come to faith, and one time we couldn't fit this church.。
[Cantonese]。
And we pray for new place.。
[Cantonese]。
10 years later, God provides new place for us, for our church.。
[Cantonese]。
And we moved new church, and now our church is growing.。
When you come to Turkey, when you join our church, you can see our church is growing because people coming to faith.。
[Cantonese]。
Again, I encourage you, brothers and sisters, come to Turkey, come to Izmir, see our church, the other churches, because there are a lot of churches in Izmir.。
[Cantonese]。
The harvest is ready in Turkey, but workers are very few, that's why we need to sometimes, we need to help from brothers and sisters like you.。
[Cantonese]。
Because as far as I see, I understand you are very faithful and strong in the faith.。
[Cantonese]。
Asian church is growing fast, so fast.。
[Cantonese]。
And I think God has a purpose for your nations.。
[Cantonese]。
To go to other nations, to bless the other nations.。
[Cantonese]。
To reach the other nations.。
[Cantonese]。
To bless the other nations, be guide to other nations.。
[Cantonese]。
That's why I encourage you, come to Turkey, come to Izmir, pray for us and hug brothers and sisters.。
Your brothers and sisters, ask them what do you need, how can we pray for you. This is very important.。
[Cantonese]。
Harvest is ready. Do you know the olive tree is very famous in Turkey?。
[Cantonese]。
Olive is very delicious, olive oil actually very delicious, very valuable in Turkey, also everywhere I know.。
[Cantonese]。
But the olive harvest is, to reap the harvest is very difficult.。
[Cantonese]。
You cannot do that alone, you need the people.。
[Cantonese]。
You cannot collect alone, you need the people to collect the olive.。
[Cantonese]。
Because the harvest is, of the olive tree is abundant.。
[Cantonese]。
That's why God has a purpose, I think your nations, because in order to bless other nations, to reach other nations, to go to other nations.。
[Cantonese]。
God wants to use you brothers and sisters, for the all nations.。
[Cantonese]。
I want to pray for you brothers and sisters, thank you so much for the invitation, good opportunity.。
But I will pray Turkish, ok?。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
I mean, thank you.。
Thank you.。
