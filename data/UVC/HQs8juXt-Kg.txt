Pastor Mark.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
- Hey everyone, good morning.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I want to do something special today。
because I want to welcome everyone to be with us here。
and we want to appreciate your presence.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Go ahead and stand up and find someone,。
find someone you have not said hi to today, okay?。
And go to that person and say, "It's good to see you."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(audience chattering)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(audience chattering)。
All right guys, well I know you have a lot to talk about.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
We will have time after the service, all right?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Well, once again, I want to piggyback on Kelly,。
what she said about we need your help to build this church.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And of course, we will appreciate the worship team。
for their music practice and their leading us today。
to worship God together.。
Let's, let's, let's move around our applause.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And then of course, the backstage,。
we have some new system installed。
and so we are trying to work out the transition.。
So we want to appreciate each and every one of them。
inside the room, it's very hot in there.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And of course, thank you for being with us today.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And if you notice our title today,。
the sermon title is called Contagious Church.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, as you see this title, I want you to think,。
are you a contagious Christian or are we a contagious church?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Yeah, and a church full of contagious Christians。
is full of people who truly experience the grace of God.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, let me give you two pictures to, you know,。
try to illustrate what it means to be contagious.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And the first image I want to show you is a negative image.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, you remember COVID-19, right?。
We could not hug each other, we cannot touch each other。
and we have to make sure we are people to people。
at least six feet apart.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
When you were in a room with other people,。
when you heard one cough and you got scared。
because the virus was spread, you know, fast and far。
and it would disrupt our relationship。
and actually it would disrupt our community.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And as you can tell, something can be contagious,。
something negative.。
Same thing happen when there's something wrong。
in our life like bitterness, it can be contagious.。
Cynicism can be contagious or lukewarm faith, you know,。
half-hearted faith or gossip or disunity.。
They're like, they're kind of like secondhand smoke。
and one person can change the whole environment.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, that's the first image.。
I want to show you the second image though.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So I want to ask you ever been in a room。
with a friend who laughs really loud?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
You know, when your friend laughs and you know,。
even you are kind of sad,。
but the laughter will change your spirit.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So when you're around people who love God,。
who take God seriously,。
you should also eventually do the same thing。
because that is contagious.。
You know, our holiness, our full spirit life。
and our faith can be contagious.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now in Acts 2, we've been studying the book of Acts。
and we see that after the Holy Spirit comes。
and the whole community become a contagious church.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And let me read this passage from 42 to 44.。
They, meaning the church in Jerusalem, the first church,。
they devote themselves to the apostles teaching。
and to the fellowship and to breaking of bread。
and to prayer and everyone was filled with awe。
and many wonders, miraculous signs。
were done by the apostles.。
All the believers were together。
and had everything in common.。
They sell the possessions and goods。
and they gave to anyone who had need.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, first, we need to know how to read the Bible.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So when we read this passage,。
we should not think that we have to copycat。
or do exactly what they did.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Because this kind of copycat, you know,。
reading and application is kind of too simplistic。
because the church in Jerusalem,。
they worship in a different way than we do。
and they worship in the temple court。
and they worship in the homes of other people。
and there were no place called church that they go to.。
Their homes are the church.。
So our context is different.。
So we cannot just copycat it and do exactly what they did.。
And we worship in a different way.。
We gather in a public place。
and we cannot simply just copy exactly what they do.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So what the Bible describes。
is not necessarily what the Bible prescribes.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But we can ask and we should ask,。
what kind of church were they。
in the first century Jerusalem context?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And we should ask,。
what kind of church were they。
in the first century Jerusalem context?。
And how does their church,。
how does this church inspire us。
to be a church of Jesus today?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So here in this passage,。
we see believers, ordinary folks,。
they live in a compelling way for the gospel。
and it was contagious。
and people were being drawn in and being attracted,。
not because the program。
or not because of their something,。
some of the activities that they did,。
it's the way they live in a compelling way。
to tell other that God is good.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So let me suggest three things。
that we should pay attention to。
that will inspire us to live a contagious church life。
and Christian life.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
First and foremost,。
we should be a Christian.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And second, we should be a Christian.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
First and foremost, be devoted.。
And secondly, they were generous.。
And third, they were alive in worship.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, verse 42, it says,。
they were devoted themselves。
to the teachings of the apostle,。
to the teaching of the Bible.。
And you remember last week,。
I mentioned this point, be committed.。
I mentioned this point, be committed.。
We Christians need to be committed.。
Worship, coming together,。
are not occasional attendance.。
Never done in a way that is half-hearted.。
So they, if you pay attention,。
they were hungry for the word of God.。
And just like we are hungry,。
we want some food.。
But spiritually, they were hungry。
and they want to go for food,。
which is the spiritual food, the word of God.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Like when you're hungry,。
you go to a happy lamb, right?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And you want to devour the food.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now here, the church is hungry for the word of God.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And brothers and sisters, I want to,。
you know, just want you to think about,。
you know, we do live in an age of distractions.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now everyone is busy, everyone is rushing,。
and we're trying to handle a lot of things。
more than we can handle.。
You know, sometimes spending time with God。
or studying the word of God with his people。
becomes optional.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, when I was younger, much younger,。
when I was a young Christian in college,。
I didn't have a habit of reading the Bible。
or reading, you know, spiritual books,。
you know, but, you know, I observed myself.。
I started to spend more time with questions。
who take the word of God seriously,。
and I began to change.。
I began to, you know, cultivate the desire,。
or the desire to, you know, really taste。
and dig into the word of God。
and taste the goodness of knowing God himself.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And let me ask you, what are you devoted to?。
Is there a hunger in your heart。
for prayer, for worship, for the word of God,。
for fellowship, for seeing people to come to Jesus?。
Now, if not, then we must change.。
We must realize that we are not the only people。
who are in the world.。
We are not the only people who are in the world.。
We are not the only people who are in the world.。
We must change, we must repent,。
and we need grace, the grace of God to have a fresh start.。
And because, you know, being a contagious church,。
being contagious Christians,。
we need to begin with a heart changed by the love of God.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, that's the first point, be devoted.。
The second point is be generous.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
44, 45, all the believers who are together。
and have everything in common,。
and they sell their possessions and goods。
and gave to anyone as he had need.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, again, our context is different.。
There's no copycat here.。
We cannot do exactly what they did.。
But that is one of the most radical part。
of their commitment, is that people in need,。
when they saw it, they didn't say,。
let me just pray about it, or let me just wait for it.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Don't get me wrong, prayers are good,。
and all this caring are good,。
but you see that all these believers。
in the first church of Jerusalem,。
they act together immediately,。
and they are generous, and they give.。
Now, this was not communism, okay?。
This was not communism, because it was not forced.。
It was not state-sponsored.。
It was moved by the spirit of God,。
moved by the love of God,。
because their lives are being transformed by Jesus,。
and they gave up everything,。
and be generous to help and to give to the church.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, if you know something about the Old Testament,。
you immediately would think of Deuteronomy 15,。
because there was a phrase。
that describes the first church of Jerusalem。
happens to be in Deuteronomy 15.。
Let me read that.。
There should be no poor among you,。
for in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess,。
he will richly bless you.。
If only you fully obey the Lord your God。
and are careful to follow all these commandments,。
do not be hard-hearted or tight-fisted.。
Give generously without a grudging heart.。
Then, because of this,。
the Lord your God will bless you in all your work.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, you see, in the Old Testament,。
God told his people Israel to be generous,。
and not only because there were needy people among them,。
mainly because that God will bless them.。
And now, in Acts 2, the Old Testament vision,。
this vision is becoming a reality,。
not through laws, but through love.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
You see, this is the logic of the kingdom of God.。
The way the world works is that when God bless me so much。
and I have extra, then I'll give a little.。
That is the way of the world.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
See, God's way does not follow human logic.。
God said, "You be generous first.。
"You give in faith, then God will bless you richly.。
"And you practice generosity first,。
"and then you will experience the blessing of God."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But as you know, our world is full of takers, not givers.。
You know, if there's food, I'll take as much as possible.。
If there are free things,。
I'll line up and get them all, right?。
You know, I drive by a food pantry。
on Ashland Avenue many times,。
and I see people line up for free things,。
and many of them are Chinese.。
And I do think there are needy people in the city.。
I do think we need to contribute.。
But, you know, I have observed many people line up,。
you know, they really don't need free food.。
They really don't need the free items,。
but they line up anyway.。
They take everything home anyway,。
and then, you know, there's so much food,。
and, you know, the food, the extra food got rotten。
and wasted.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
, and at times, you know, if you observe,。
even the church is full of takers.。
You know, the first thing people come to church is to take,。
is to get, to get something.。
And have you ever thought of, you know,。
the food in the cafe and the ministry?。
We need financial support.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And a couple weeks ago, we had our annual core team retreat,。
and one of the most important items we discussed。
and pray about is our church finance.。
It's what we need to sustain and to operate our church.。
And as of the end of June this year,。
we lack almost 20,000,。
and we need more than 38,000 a month to operate,。
to pay the rent, and to, you know,。
pay the staff and support the ministries.。
And I think if you are practicing,。
tithes and offering regularly,。
and I wanna thank God for you,。
but if you are not,。
I think the Bible is challenging us to give regularly,。
and that is one of the things we take part。
in building the church together.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
See, the word of God tells you。
that if you really wanna experience the love of God,。
the blessing of God, you must act first.。
You must act in faith, and not just our leftover,。
but our love, our response to the grace of God.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, remember what Jesus said in Luke 16.。
He says, "No servant can serve two masters.。
"Either he will hate the one and love the other,。
"or he will be devoted to one and despise the other.。
"You cannot serve both God and money."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
For years, you know, walking with Christ,。
you know, for decades, you know,。
I experienced that if my heart for God is conditional,。
there's no way I can experience。
the unconditional grace of God.。
And I wanna remind you, you know,。
a contagious church is one that gives freely.。
It's one that we receive the great grace of God,。
and then we offer our best.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, the third point here is be alive in worship.。
And it says, "Every day, they gathered together。
"in the temple courts, and they broke bread in their homes,。
"and ate together, and they were glad and with sincere hearts,。
"praising God and enjoying the favor of the people.。
"And the Lord added to the number daily。
"who were being saved."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And you see this community was alive,。
and their hearts were joyful,。
and they worshiped together with, you know, will, attitude,。
and they didn't worship God out of duty.。
They did it with joy.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And the Lord said, "You know,。
"if you're going to worship God,。
"you're going to worship Him with joy."。
Duty, they did it with joy.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, God does not look at your appearance.。
God is not so interested in your, on the outside,。
how you look on the outside.。
God sees your heart deep inside.。
You know, when you come to worship,。
you come to pray and reflect,。
and we should all do this,。
and pray that and prepare us,。
help me, God, to love you with all my heart.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, as I reminded you last week,。
we Christians, we the church, are always visible in public.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, you imagine if we are all takers, you know,。
new visitors, you know, people come to our community,。
they will feel it.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And you see, if we are all givers,。
then God will sense, people will sense the life in us,。
the life of God in us.。
And people will see, you know, how they eat together,。
how they spend time with each other,。
how they worship together, and they gave generously.。
And people will say, "You know what?。
"I want to be part of that.。
"I want that too."。
And, you know, just a reminder,。
you know, last week I told you, all Christians, all of us,。
we are living under the spotlight.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
We are living under the spotlight.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So my conclusion will come to this question.。
Does your life make the gospel attractive?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, when someone sees you,。
would that person want to follow Jesus。
after watching how you live?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And a contagious Christian life is worshipful, joyful,。
and, you know, it's a sharing life.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And that is the life of church this Holy Spirit creates.。
Well, it doesn't mean we are all perfect.。
We all have our flaws and we all have our shortcomings.。
But, you know, that's what the Spirit is trying to create,。
a new church, a new life.。
And it's not a private life and that's not personal life,。
but a visible life.。
It's not a strange life, but a generous life.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
See, you come to God today。
and God wants to do something for you.。
You know, God wants to transform your life.。
God wants your life and your heart and your home。
to be contagious with His love and grace and generosity.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Just like people were drawn and being attracted。
to the community of Acts 2.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And that's why we are here today.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And that's why we are here today.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So there are three important steps or simple steps。
I want to suggest to you today.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
First, starting today, read the Bible every day。
and connect with other Christians.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And practice generosity.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And we all need to give as much generously。
to support the ministry.。
And third is to worship God wholeheartedly.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, remember last week, what happened?。
You know, each of you get a name, right?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Did you learn that name?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Did you pray for that person?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
You did, I see nodding heads.。
That's great, that's great.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
If you've forgotten, if you've forgotten about it,。
(speaking in foreign language)。
that's okay.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
You have one more week to go.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So this coming week, remember that person, okay?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And today, I know there are new faces among us.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So I want you, after the service,。
to go to someone who's new to us.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And learn that person's name.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And then pray for that person.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
All right, so remember these three things.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, read the Bible every day and connect with others.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And then practice generosity.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And worship God wholeheartedly.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And after the service, I want you to do a little more, okay?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Remember you had the name from last week.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, after the service.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Go to that person.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And this is what you're gonna say.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Thank you for worshiping with us today.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, can you do that?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
It's pretty easy, right?。
Secondly, okay, thank you for joining us in worship today.。
And secondly, you're gonna say,。
how can I pray for you this week?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And third thing is I wanna worship you next week.。
Worship with you next week.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, first thing is what?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Go to that person and say,。
thank you for worshiping with us today.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Secondly is how can I pray for you this week?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now don't talk too long, okay?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, it's very, very concise and tell them,。
you know, okay, this is how I can pray for you this week.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And thirdly is I wanna see you next week.。
I wanna worship God with you next Sunday.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Shall we do that?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And remember, we have to build the church together.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Every single one of us.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
To build this family together for the glory of God.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Well, let's pray.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Father, we wanna give you thanks.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Because you are the God of our church.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Thank you for your presence.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Thank you for loving us.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And I wanna pray for each and every one of us today.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
May we act in faith to worship you, to follow you,。
then you will bless us.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And I pray that you will continue。
to build our church together.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
May your love transform us so that we can work for you。
and we can serve you and worship you.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
We pay all this in Jesus' name.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Well, thank you for being with us today.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Remember the three things I wanna do to your neighbor.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, remember that, go to that person,。
thank you for being with us.。
And secondly, how can I pray for you?。
Third is I wanna worship God with you next week.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(gentle music)。
And God bless you.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(gentle music)。
(gentle music)。
