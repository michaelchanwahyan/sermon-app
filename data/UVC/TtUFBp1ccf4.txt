Hey everyone, how's it going?。
How's it going?。
Good?。
Alright, why don't we say hi to our neighbors?。
And I want to thank Patrick for doing the announcement.。
We want more people to be part of it.。
And let's go around, look around and see your neighbor and say hi, okay?。
(Translated)。
Okay, we'll give her a high five or something.。
(Translated)。
Okay.。
Alright, so good to see you all.。
And perhaps you have been to church for years, for many, many years,。
and perhaps you are new to the church.。
And from time to time we need to make sure we understand what church is all about.。
(Translated)。
So last week I was in Toronto and Montreal for a few days.。
And I paid a ticket to visit a church.。
And this is a 200 years old church, and a historic church called the Church of Notre Dame in Montreal.。
And it was a beautiful church, beautiful.。
And it's just a wonderful place to be.。
And I spent some time there and I was totally taken by all the stained glass and Gothic style building.。
And it was a beautiful church.。
(Translated)。
So, you know, as you can see, if I can do it on PowerPoint,。
and I was in the church, in this church, and I spent some time there and I asked the question,。
"What is a church?"。
And what is the church all about?。
And to many people, to many of us, sometimes we got messed up。
because we, sometimes we believe that the church is a place that we go to.。
And that's why I want to ask the question, you know, "What is the church?"。
You know, even though there's some truth to we go to church today, but what is the church?。
(Translated)。
So, this is a beautiful church, right?。
(Translated)。
And, but, you know, there's also a huge misunderstanding what the church is all about.。
And, you know, the Bible says the church is not a place, the church is not a building.。
And we have to ask, "What is the church in the Bible?"。
(Translated)。
In fact, the church is us, the people, the people of God.。
(Translated)。
So today, in this message, I want to emphasize three basic points in this sermon.。
And the three basic points is all about how do we become the church.。
(Translated)。
And the first point is we are all sinners.。
(Translated)。
And we have been reading the book of Acts this year,。
and it's clear from the book that the church is not a group of perfect people.。
(Translated)。
And you remember in chapter 2 of the book of Acts, Peter preached the first sermon,。
and he pointed out that we are all sinners, and we sin against God,。
and Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and He rose from the dead for all of us.。
(Translated)。
And then the people listened to Peter's first sermon, and their hearts were cut,。
and they felt that they need to respond, and they asked Peter what they should do.。
(Translated)。
And then, you know, the people were being said that, Peter said,。
"Repent and be baptized, and every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of sins, of your sins."。
(Translated)。
And these are very bold statements, okay? And they confront us with two statements of truth.。
(Translated)。
The first one is we are all sinners, and the second one is only Jesus can save us.。
(Translated)。
Now, you have to understand, the church, even our church, is not a museum of saints.。
The church is home for real people, and we have real problems, okay? We have real brokenness.。
And we're not here because we got it all together, but because we know we can.。
(Translated)。
Now, imagine a hospital. Imagine a hospital. Have you been to a hospital?。
That might not be a good thing, but, you know, the hospital is full of sick people,。
and they want to get well, but, you know, the hospital is not for healthy people.。
The church is kind of like a hospital.。
(Translated)。
And we are all forgiven, and we are all healed by the grace of God,。
because of what Jesus has done for us on the cross.。
And the one, the one condemned on the cross, Jesus himself, should have been you and me,。
because we are sinners.。
(Translated)。
And the good news is, God healed all of our sins on Jesus on the cross, and all of our sins are crucified.。
(Translated)。
Now, the Bible is really clear on this.。
The Bible, God loves us and sends his son to die on the cross, so that your sins,。
every bit of your sin, will be forgiven.。
(Translated)。
So, that's the first truth, is that we are all sinners, we are all broken people.。
And the second is, we are saved by the grace of God.。
(Translated)。
And this second truth, we have to note that, you know, many people think that,。
"Okay, only if we try, only if I try harder, if I do more good things than bad things, then I'll be okay."。
(Translated)。
Now, the truth is, you know, sin is not a scale of balance.。
It's a debt that we cannot pay, and even one sin makes us guilty before a holy, sinless, holy, infinite God.。
(Translated)。
Now, imagine an ocean, okay, endless ocean.。
And you are in the sea, and the waves are high, and the current is very, very strong.。
And you have no strength left, and there's no land in sight.。
You are right in the middle of the ocean, and you cannot swim back, and you cannot save yourself.。
(Translated)。
Now, in this kind of situation, what you need is someone else, someone else to rescue you.。
Now, sin is like that. Sin is like an ocean. It's like an endless ocean.。
It pulls us away from God, from the land.。
And there's no amount of effort, good deeds, or good religion, or self-improvement can bring us back to the shore.。
Now, without a rescuer, we will drown to death.。
(Translated)。
In the book of Romans, chapter 3 here, it says,。
"This righteousness, the righteousness from God, comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe."。
And there is no difference, for all of us have sinned, and we fall short of the glory of God.。
(Translated)。
Now, we often have a misunderstanding here. We always think that what the Bible is all about,。
and we think that the Bible is to tell us to be a better person.。
In fact, the Bible never does that. The Bible never tells you to become a better person.。
The Bible is not a self-help moral book.。
(Translated)。
Okay, say it with me. The Bible is never a self-improvement book. All right?。
The Bible is never a self-improvement book, so that we can do better,。
and we can reach out to this holy and infinite God.。
(Translated)。
The Bible, though, tells us that we can never be good enough,。
and we may be better than someone else.。
You know, look around your neighbor, and you may be better than your neighbor in some sense.。
The Bible never tells us that. Okay?。
Or you may say, you know, look at that person, look at this person.。
You know, he's worse than me, and I'm glad I'm better.。
(Translated)。
The fact is, the Bible tells us we are all sinners. We fall short of the glory of God.。
And we don't stand righteous before God.。
And we stand, all of us, we stand condemned in the presence of God.。
(Translated)。
Now, we can never be good enough to meet God's standard,。
and we cannot be good enough to stand in front of God.。
Now, that is true, and that is also bad news, right?。
(Translated)。
It seems like drowning in the ocean, and there's no land inside,。
and you can't reach the shore on your own.。
(Translated)。
So we have to ask the question, what can we do as sinners in front of God?。
What can we do when we cannot save ourselves?。
(Translated)。
Now, that's all the bad news, but the good news comes from the Bible.。
It says, "God came to save us."。
God came to save us. Not we can save ourselves, but God came to save us,。
and we are all saved by the grace of God alone.。
(Translated)。
So the third point here is that only Jesus can save us.。
(Translated)。
Now, in chapter 4 of the book of Acts, if you remember, or if you go back and check,。
the religious leaders in Jerusalem, they crucify Jesus on the cross,。
and they confront Peter about Peter's right to preach the gospel.。
(Translated)。
And Peter responds by saying this verse in chapter 4, verse 12.。
It says, "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven。
given to mankind by which we must be saved."。
(Translated)。
Now, why only Jesus can save?。
(Translated)。
Because Jesus is the only one who lives a perfect and sinless life.。
(Translated)。
And Jesus is the only one who died as a substitute for our sins.。
(Translated)。
And third, Jesus is the only one who rose from the dead and defeated death for all of us.。
(Translated)。
Think about it. You know, there's no, there's none.。
There's no leader in the world, in history.。
There's no political leader or no philosophy.。
No self-effort can deal with our sin.。
(Translated)。
Only Jesus can bridge the holy God, sinless God, and us broken sinners.。
Only He can be the bridge, and only Jesus has the power to forgive。
and to give us the life of God, the eternal life.。
(Translated)。
So we have to ask at the end of the sermon is to ask ourselves, "What must we do now?"。
(Translated)。
What must you do? What must we do?。
The Bible tells us something very simple, but life-changing.。
(Translated)。
The Bible tells us at least three things.。
First is to repent.。
Which is turning away from our sin, our brokenness, by trusting in God Himself.。
(Translated)。
So the first step is to repent. Repent from our sin and our brokenness,。
and make a U-turn back to God.。
And secondly is to believe, which is trusting in Jesus Christ Himself,。
alone as our Savior and our Lord.。
(Translated)。
And be baptized, that's the third step, which is a decoration,。
a perfect decoration of our faith and our new life in Jesus.。
(Translated)。
Now, I don't know if you have been baptized or not, but you know, what is baptism?。
So often we have some misunderstanding about what baptism is all about.。
We think baptism is a graduation ceremony.。
(Translated)。
And we think that, okay, once we're baptized, we graduate, like graduating from school,。
and we don't have to go back, and we upgrade or something.。
(Translated)。
Baptism, no, it's not like that. Baptism is not like graduation ceremony.。
(Translated)。
Baptism is a perfect decoration of our faith in Jesus.。
(Translated)。
Now, baptism means we say to the world that, yes, I'm a sinner, I'm broken,。
but I have experienced the grace of God, and by the grace of God, I stand righteous before God.。
(Translated)。
When you believe in Jesus, your sins are forgiven, and we are given the new life, the eternal life.。
(Translated)。
And sometimes the Bible, especially the book of Acts, describes the eternal life as the gift of the Holy Spirit.。
(Translated)。
And the gift of the Holy Spirit was that it's actually God's own presence in our life,。
and God is living with you, living in you.。
(Translated)。
Now, my final question is, if you have made Jesus your Savior and Lord,。
you have accepted Jesus as your Lord, and it is time for you to restart your life, restart your commitment.。
(Translated)。
If you have never done that, and now is the time to turn to Jesus.。
(Translated)。
And on my last slide, there's a very simple prayer, and I hope that we can restart our life by trusting in Jesus.。
(Translated)。
And it's a very simple prayer.。
It says, "Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner, and I cannot save myself.。
I believe you died for my sins and rose again for me.。
And I now turn from my sin and trust you as my Savior.。
Forgive me and help me follow you the rest of my life.。
Would that be your prayer today?。
Would that be your prayer?。
And we can pray this prayer and trust in God, trust in Jesus.。
(Translated)。
If you can, you can pray with your heart.。
Or you can pray out loud with me.。
Let me read this prayer again.。
Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner.。
I cannot save myself.。
I believe you died for my sins and rose again.。
I turn from my sin and trust you as my Savior.。
Please forgive me and help me follow you the rest of my life.。
Amen.。
Let's pray.。
Father, you heard our prayer.。
And we want to trust in you.。
And thank you for being our Lord and our Savior.。
Thank you for dying for our sin on the cross.。
And you rose from the death for all of us.。
And help us to follow you.。
Because you are the Lord of our life.。
In Jesus' name we pray.。
Amen.。
Now, last note I want to give to you is that if you did pray this prayer,。
and you have questions about faith, you have questions about the Bible,。
you know, God, Jesus, you know, please stop by and talk to one of us, one of our staff.。
(Speaking Chinese)。
Okay, so we have a freshman out there,。
and we want to thank the Brothers and Sisters for preparing that.。
(Speaking Chinese)。
Please spend some time to get to know one another.。
(Speaking Chinese)。
Alright, God bless you.。
(Speaking Chinese)。
(Music)。
