Good morning, UB. I hope you guys are extra awake today with the additional hour of sleep。
yesterday night. So, some of you may know, I recently just moved back into the city to。
report, and this is actually the first time that I moved into pretty much like a fully。
unfurnished apartment. And one of the things, one of the lists that I make for my apartment。
is called things that would be nice to have but not necessarily needed. And under the。
list are things like a new desk chair, an external monitor for my laptop, a couch, and。
a couple of area rugs because my entire floor is like pretty much like bathroom tile. And。
it gets really cold, especially heading into the fall and the winter as well. And so, if。
you haven't guessed it yet, that list is pretty much some of the things that I think would,。
in some ways, increase the quality of my life a little better as I live in this apartment,。
right? So, most of us are constantly finding different ways that we think can upgrade the。
quality of our life, whether it is getting the newest iPhone, getting the latest technology,。
or buying a new car, or doing some home projects to renovate your house, make it a little better。
to live in, or even to smaller things like buying a new rice cooker that cooks better。
rice. So, this is because deep down in us, there is always a deep desire to live a good,。
a quality, and a meaningful life, right? So, in fact, there's actually an entire field。
of study that is being dedicated to this goal of helping people live a good life. And that。
field is called positive psychology. And a lot of universities actually in the US now,。
they actually started offering this class in the field of positive psychology as well.。
So, this is according to University of Pennsylvania for the Center of Positive Psychology. This。
is how they define what positive psychology is. So, positive psychology is the scientific。
study of factors that enable individuals and communities to thrive. The field is founded。
on the belief that people want to live meaningful and fulfilling lives, to cultivate what is。
best within themselves, and to enhance your experience of love, work, and play. And this。
quest of searching for the good life is not just a new and recent endeavor. But, in fact,。
all throughout history, if we take a look at the ancient Greek and the Rome, we actually。
find many different philosophical schools that actually try to take on this quest of。
what is a good life. So, for example, for the Epicureans, a good life is one that is。
in pursuit of pleasure and the absence of pain. For Aristotle, a good life is a pursuit。
of virtues and development of good personal character. And for Stoics, it is living in。
harmony with the nature and with the cosmos, with the world around us. So, as we can see,。
the questions of what must we do to experience a good life or what is a good life, this is。
actually an age-old question that different people throughout different generations have。
tried to give an account for. But now I want to turn the questions to all of you here.。
Who are you putting your trust in that you think will lead to a true and blessed life?。
And if it is not a who, what are you putting your hope in that you think will lead you。
to happiness in this life? So, let's pray together before we dive into our passage today.。
Heavenly Father, thank you for your new mercies every morning, and we thank you that we are。
able to come together as a body of Christ this morning to worship you. And I just ask。
that during this time, your Spirit will be with us as we open up your Word and receive。
from what you have to say for us this morning. I also just ask that your Spirit will be with。
me as I speak from your Word. I just ask that your name will be glorified through our worship。
this morning. I pray this in your Son's name, Amen.。
Okay, so I'm going to do things a little differently this morning. So, if you have your Bible,。
whether it is on your phone or a physical Bible, I want to welcome you to pull out the。
passage together. So, we'll be looking at Matthew 5, verse 17 to 20 this morning. So,。
if you have your Bible, I would encourage you to pull it out, and we're going to go。
through it together as well. So, I'm going to be reading from the NIV version. So, Matthew。
5, verse 17. "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have。
not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth。
disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear。
from the law until everything is accomplished. Therefore, anyone who sets aside one of the。
least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom。
of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the。
kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees。
and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven." So, this。
is the word of God. So, when I preached here last time, back in June, I began a series。
on Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. And our passage today is actually situated right at the main。
body of this Sermon on the Mount. So, again, I want to just give a quick review of the。
structure of this Sermon on the Mount as a whole. So, this Sermon on the Mount begins。
on Matthew 5 and it ends on Matthew 7. And last time, we looked at the introductory narrative。
framework, pretty much setting up the scenes for where this entire teaching is happening.。
We saw that Jesus went up on the mountainside and then he began to teach his disciples.。
But we also see that there's some crowd present among them as well. And then we look。
at the introduction as well last time, basically the Beatitudes and also the call to be the。
salt and the light to the world around us. And so, in my last sermon, I also highlight。
that this Sermon on the Mount as a whole, it serves as the guiding principle on how。
we ought to live our life in the kingdom of heaven. This is not a set of impossible rules。
that we cannot, like we can never follow, but this is actually an invitation from Jesus。
to a way of living that will lead to true blessing and flourishing. And we also look。
at how Jesus defined what a true and blessed life is through the Beatitudes. And according。
to Jesus, a true and blessed life is a counterculture one. It is one that is being poor in spirit,。
mourning for sins and the brokenness around us. It is one that is being identified as。
humble and meek and so on. So, today we're going to look at how we can experience this。
truly blessed life through our passage today. And this is the big idea that I will be focusing。
on today. Because the truly blessed life can only be experienced through Jesus, we need。
to follow him and live in conformity with him. Again, because the truly blessed life。
can only be experienced through Jesus, we need to follow him and live in conformity。
with him. So, why the truly blessed life can only be experienced through Jesus alone but。
not through other worldly things? In some ways, this is sort of like an exclusive claim,。
right? By saying that Jesus is the only way that we can experience this kind of life.。
So, for my sermon today, I'm going to give you two reasons on why the truly blessed life。
can only be experienced through Jesus, and then I'm going to give us an implication。
of what it means for us as followers of Christ. So, I hope you follow along. I'm going to。
give you two reasons and one implication. So, reason number one on why the truly blessed。
life can only be experienced through Jesus is because he is the only one that can fulfill。
the righteous requirement of God on our behalf. So, let's look with me again in verse 17.。
So, Jesus began this section by saying, "Do not think that I've come to abolish the law。
or the prophets." So, what is the law or the prophets? The law represents God's standard。
of righteousness and holiness. Or, in other words, it basically refers to what it means。
to live rightly before God. And the prophets, on the other hand, they help point to the。
heart of the law, that it is not just about an outward appearance of obedience to this。
law, but more importantly, it is about the attitude of one's heart. And collectively,。
the laws and the prophets, they refer to the Old Testament scripture in this entirety.。
And by declaring that he has not come to abolish the law and the prophets, Jesus sets the tone。
right away at the beginning of his ministry by clearing away all the potential accusations。
and misunderstanding that people might have about Jesus, that he is somewhat anti-law。
or anti-the Old Testament. And then Jesus further clarifies that, "I have not come to。
abolish them, but to fulfill them." Okay, can you guys repeat after me? Not to abolish,。
but to fulfill. Okay, one more time. I think you guys can do better. Not to abolish,。
but to fulfill. Okay, thank you. So, what does it mean that Jesus fulfilled the law。
and prophets and not to abolish them? So, if you think of all the different laws that。
we have, whether it is in your house, at school, at work, or in our society, behind each of。
the law, there is a purpose, right? So, let's take the examples of speed limit in a school。
zone. So, the purpose behind the speed limit at a school zone is not to limit how fast。
you can drive, even though that is kind of like the consequence of it. But the true purpose。
behind a speed limit at a school zone is to protect the students so that driver doesn't。
just drive like 80 miles per hour and like run over school students. However, we can。
be following the law, but totally miss the purpose behind the law, right? So, if you。
have been with us this past couple of months, you might recall one of the announcements。
that we make on both of our English and Cantonese services. Hey, if you see some kids running。
around all the expensive car outside of our buildings, make sure to kind of like tell。
them to like go somewhere else and play, right? So, one time after the Cantonese service,。
I was just like walking towards the bathroom and then I saw some kids chasing around the。
car. So, I just walk over and tell them, hey kids, like don't run around and play around。
here. If you want to play, you can like go to the hallway and like do whatever you want。
over there. But one of the kids, he basically just looked at me and replied, well, I'm not。
going to run around the car then. I'm just going to walk slowly around the car. So, did。
you guys see the problem here? Did you guys see the disconnect right here? The true intent。
of me telling them not to run around the car is so that they don't accidentally like scratch。
or like bump into the expensive car because we have to be like responsible to like pay。
for the damage. But by the kids kind of like responding by, okay, I'm not going to run。
around the car, but I'm still going to play around it by just like walking slowly, that。
pretty much just defeat the purpose of the law, right? That I want them to like not bump。
into the car or like accidentally like scratch those expensive car. So, in the same way,。
Jesus will fuse the law by revealing to us what the true intent and purpose is behind。
the law in the Old Testament through his teaching. And in that way, we can understand what Jesus。
actually means or like what those law actually means. And on the other hand, Jesus will fuse。
the prophets in the sense that Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of all the Old Testament。
prophecies made by the prophets about the one, the Messiah, who will come and deliver。
God's people and bring about a new relationship between God and his people. So, when Jesus。
say that he fuses the law and prophet, it means that the Old Testament in its entirety。
ultimately points to Jesus. And Jesus is also the official interpreter of the Old Testament.。
And this Old Testament law, in light of Jesus coming, they now has a deeper meaning. And。
in my following sermons, I will take a look at some of the examples. If you would just。
want to take a look, if you have your Bible, just look at like verse 21 and the section。
that follows. You will see that Jesus actually used this formula a lot. You have heard that。
it was said, and then he will quote an Old Testament law. And then Jesus will say, but。
I tell you this, and then Jesus would give his own interpretation. So, in that way, Jesus。
bring kind of like a deeper meaning to this Old Testament law. So, why the truly blessed。
life can only be experienced through Jesus? We look at the first reason that he is the。
only one that can fulfill the righteous requirement of God on our behalf. And as a result of that,。
if we believe in him, Christ's righteousness will become our own and we will be made right。
with God. And on this, Paul highlight that. This is from Romans 10 verse 4. Christ is。
the combination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.。
And now we're going to look at the second reason. The second reason that the truly blessed。
life can only be experienced through Jesus is because Jesus and his word is the only。
and ultimate authority that will endure forever and lead to the truly blessed life. So, verse。
18, for truly I tell you. So, notice the wording that Jesus used here. For truly I tell you。
or for I tell you the truth. So, right away, Jesus is preparing his disciples for a very。
important truth regarding the word of God that he's about to say to them. And then he。
continues. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter,。
not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the law until everything。
is accomplished. And so, to give a little context here, the Old Testament is written。
mostly in Hebrew and a little bit in Aramaic. And when Jesus says not the smallest letter,。
he is referring to the Hebrew letter, Yot, which is pretty much like an apostrophe. And。
when he refers to the least stroke of a pen, he's referring to a stroke that in the Hebrew。
alphabets that is used to differentiate a few of the different characters. But what。
Jesus is doing here, he's pretty much using an argument from lesser to greater. And so。
he said, if he has even the smallest part of the Bible will not be abolished, what about。
the law or the prophets? And so once again, Jesus is saying to his disciples that he has。
not come to abolish the law and the prophets, but quite the opposite. He intends to bring。
the law to his desired goal. That is a true transformation of our heart to the extent。
that even the smallest details in the Old Testament will be fully accomplished in his。
life and in his teaching. And on top of that, he say, until heaven and earth disappear or。
until everything is accomplished, what Jesus is saying here is that as long as our present。
world continue to exist, the word of God will continue to be valid and claims in authority。
over our lives. Until every single passage in the Old Testament is being fulfilled in。
him. So let's step back for a moment. When we hear something like this, that Jesus and。
his words claims his authority over our lives. How does that make you feel? I think for me,。
it actually feels a little uneasy because one of the popular anthems that our current。
generation is singing is, you can be whoever you want to be, or I can be whoever I want。
to be. I don't have to submit to anything, and I get to decide how I want to live my。
life as long as it makes me happy. And on a surface level, this sounds kind of appealing,。
right? It seems like there's a lot of freedom to do whatever you want to do as long as it。
doesn't hurt other people. However, if we actually take a look at the history of Israel。
in the Old Testament, it is not hard for us to actually recognize the consistent threat。
that when people are left to their own to decide what is good and evil in their own。
sight, 10 out of 10 times, it would always lead to downfall and destruction. And if you。
still need more convincing, all you need to do is just to look at the society around us。
and the world around us, and I'm sure you can figure out pretty quickly of what evil。
humanity is capable of when we're being left to our own device. And so, what is the。
alternative here? If we get to decide how we want to live is not the solution, what。
is the alternative here? I would argue it is to live in full submission to Jesus and。
His Word, again, because the Word of God is the only and ultimate authority that will。
lead to a truly blessed life. And just as a parent who knows a lot more than their children。
about what is good and safe for them and then sets certain rules and boundaries to protect。
their children, Jesus, who is all-knowing, knows infinitely more than us as humans on。
what leads to a flourishing life. And so, these rules and laws are put in place not。
to restrict our freedom, but it is put in place out of love to protect us. So, instead。
of seeing this law as restrictive, it is actually a means of grace from God. Instead。
of letting humanity walk down the path of self-destruction, these rules that is from。
the Word of God function as a guide to lead us to a truly blessed life. So, we look at。
two reasons on why the truly blessed life can only be experienced through Jesus. What。
is the implication for us as followers of Christ? To answer that, let us look at verse。
19 together. So, verse 19. "Therefore, anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands。
and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever。
practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."。
So, how should we live differently in light of this truth that Jesus is the only one that。
can lead us to a truly blessed life? So, this is what I would say. As Christ followers,。
we need to live in conformity to Jesus and His commands. So, when Jesus say to practice。
these commands, it means to not just submit to these commands, but also to live out, to。
live out the commands as redefined by Jesus. Again, this is not just an outward conformity。
to the law, but it comes from a sincere heart that is being transformed by the power of。
the gospel. And in the following verse, Jesus further clarifies the importance of keeping。
these commands and teaching others as well. So, He say, "For I tell you that unless your。
righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly。
not enter the kingdom of heaven." When it comes to the Torah, the Pharisees and the。
teachers of the laws, they are kind of like the cream of the crop. And the Pharisees particularly,。
they're actually being known for the strict observance of the Jewish law. They don't just。
like follow the laws that God has given in the Old Testament, but they themselves come。
up with extra multiple laws just so that they can be extra careful. So, what Jesus is saying。
here is that, in verse 20, is that, "According to our human standard of righteousness, the。
only way a person can enter into the kingdom of heaven is for their righteousness to surpass。
those of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law." And so, let me put it into some。
perspective for us right here. So, since I moved back into the city, I got into the hobby。
or sports of bouldering or rock climbing. And I actually have a few opportunities to。
bring our youth students from Summit to climb in the past few months as well. And we actually。
just went over yesterday as well. And so, in climbing, the difficulty of the boulder。
problem is usually being great on the V scale, with V0 being the easiest grade, which is。
pretty much like climbing a ladder. And currently, V17 being the most difficult grade that, yeah,。
in the world pretty much, like someone has successfully climbed. And usually, when we。
bring our kids to climb, they will climb in around the V0 to V2 range, and maybe occasionally。
a V3. And in order to encourage them sometimes to try a little harder, some of my counselors。
will tell these kids, "Hey, if you're able to climb this problem, I will buy you a free。
boba." And so, you guys have to understand that for this middle schooler and high schooler,。
getting a free boba is like the best gift that they could ever receive or that they。
could ever think of. So, every time we put those words out, "Hey, if you can climb this,。
you get a free boba," they will just get extra motivated and try really hard to get all the。
way to the top. But imagine if we tell them this, "Hey, I will buy you a free boba if。
you're able to climb this V17 problem," which, to put it into context, there are less than。
10 climbers in the world that have successfully climbed a V17. So, if we tell this to the。
kids, what do you think their reaction would be? They'll probably be like, "That is just。
impossible. What do you want us to do right here?" So, in the same way, trying to earn。
our own way into the kingdom of heaven with our own human effort, that is by having a。
righteousness that surpasses or exceeds the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, is。
almost as impossible as just me telling these kids to climb a V17 if they want to get a。
free boba. But the good news is this, that the righteousness that we need to enter into。
the kingdom of heaven, it does not come from ourselves. It doesn't depend on who we are,。
what ethnicity we are, what socioeconomic status we are, or what ability we have, or。
what effort we put into it. The righteousness that we need to enter into the kingdom of。
heaven comes from Jesus alone because he has fulfilled the law and the prophets. In other。
words, the entire Old Testament scripture is found in fulfillment in the person of Jesus。
through his life and his teachings. So, I've seen one of the preachers did this exercise。
once before. He pretty much went through all the book in the Old Testament and tried to。
show us how Jesus fulfilled each of these Old Testament scriptures. So, I did my own。
similar exercise here, but I'm not going to go through every single book in the Old Testament.。
I just pick out a few to kind of try to show us what it means that the Old Testament scripture。
ultimately being fulfilled in the life and teaching of Jesus. So, ready? Here we go.。
In Genesis, Jesus is the promised offspring from the woman who will crush the serpent's。
head. In the book of Exodus, Jesus is the Passover lamb whose blood save us from death.。
And also, Jesus is the tabernacle that dwells among us as his people. In the book of Leviticus,。
Jesus is the ultimate offering that deals with our sins once and for all. And Jesus。
is also the high priest that become the mediator between God, a holy God, and a sinful people.。
In the book of Numbers, Jesus is the bronze serpent in which those who look to him will。
be saved. In the book of Deuteronomy, Jesus is the greater prophet that Moses has promised.。
And in the book of Proverbs, which we have looked into the past two weeks with Pastor Mark,。
Jesus is the wisdom personified. In the book of Isaiah, Jesus is Emmanuel, God with us.。
He is the suffering servant who was despised and rejected, pierced for our transgressions。
and crushed for our iniquities. And by his wounds, we are healed. In the book of Jeremiah,。
Jesus is the new covenant that the Lord promised. In the book of Ezekiel, Jesus is the one who。
will give us a new heart and a new spirit in order to do the will of God. And in the book of Daniel,。
Jesus is the one like the son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. And I can go on and on,。
but hopefully you get the point that because Jesus has fulfilled the law and prophets to。
enter into the kingdom of heaven and experience a truly blessed life, it doesn't depend on。
our own righteousness, but the righteousness of Jesus alone. And all we need to do is to。
follow him and live in conformity with him. So I want to come back to this verse in Romans 10,。
verse four again. Christ is the combination of the law so that there may be righteousness。
for everyone who believes. So we don't usually use the word combination in our day-to-day。
conversation, right? But the word combination here refers to the Greek telos, which pretty。
much means the end or the goal. So when Paul say Christ is the combination of the law,。
what he is referring to is that the angle of the law is to lead us to Christ by revealing。
to us our need for greater righteousness that can only come through Jesus. Again,。
because our own righteousness can never be enough to save us. So are you still trying to。
earn your own righteousness? Once again, I want to start, I want to end with the same。
questions that I start this sermon with. Who or what are you putting your trust in that。
you think will lead you to a true and blessed life? Are you still searching for a way that。
will lead to a truly blessed life, but with the intent to do it on your own strength?。
Here's the invitation from Jesus. Come, follow me. So in a few moments, we're going to take。
the communion together as a church and as the body of Christ in response to our message。
today. And my hope is that this will be a time for us to slow down, to reflect on the。
message that we have just received, and also to remember his sacrifice for us at the cross.。
And 2 Corinthians 5 21, it says, "For God made Christ who would have never sinned to。
be the offering for our sin, in order that we could be made right with God through Christ."。
So in communion, the bread symbolizes the body of Christ broken for us in order that。
we could be made right with God through Christ. And the cup, it represents the blood of Christ。
poured out for us in order that we could be made right with God through Christ.。
And so for those of you who are new here at UV, we have two tables set up with our communion。
elements, one here at the front and one at the back. And before we take the communion。
as the body of Christ, I'm going to put up a couple of reflection questions from my sermon。
this morning up on the screen. And yeah, Phoebe, are you able to go back to my slides?。
Okay, yeah. So I'm going to put these questions up. And what I want you to do is just to,。
yeah, take some time to sit before the Lord and reflect on these questions.。
Who and/or what are you putting your trust in that you think will lead to a true and blessed life?。
And in what ways are you trying to earn your own righteousness instead of trusting and submitting to Jesus?。
And during this time, I will have Lucy play a song in the background. This song is called。
"Manifold," and it is actually written by a good friend of mine, Pastor Jordan Brown.。
And the idea of this song came from Ephesians 3, 10 to 11. And this is basically a song,。
this song is a call for the church to be the manifold wisdom of God to the world around us。
and to be the presence of God's kingdom here on earth. So, when Lucy is playing in the background,。
whenever you are ready during the song, you can come up and grab the element,。
and then you can go back to your own seat and take some time to reflect on those questions.。
And whenever you're ready, take the bread and the cup at your own time.。
And after that, feel free to join us in singing this song together.。
And one last thing before we enter into communion, I want to speak to those in the room。
who might not identify themselves as followers of Jesus yet.。
First and foremost, we really appreciate you being here, and I just want to say thank you for。
coming here and joining us in our worship this morning. But we ask that you not partake in the communion。
because taking the bread and the cup is a public declaration of one's beliefs in the work that Jesus has done on your behalf.。
So, if you're not ready to commit your life to Christ yet, I would encourage you instead to use this time。
to really reflect and consider what the good news of Jesus, of the gospel is,。
what Jesus has done on your behalf, and his desire for you to experience the truly blessed life.。
So, yeah, you can take some time to sit and reflect for those questions,。
and whenever you're ready, you can come up, take the element on your own, and yeah, take it.。

- Father, thank you.。
Thank you for the cross.。
Thank you for the free gift of salvation。
that you made Jesus who knew no sin。
to be a sin offering for us。
in order that we could become the righteousness of God。
through Christ.。
I ask that this truth will really grow deep in us。
that we're able just to abide in your love。
through Jesus that you have for us.。
And so I just ask that because of this truth,。
we're able to live out who you have called us to be,。
to be your kingdom presence to the brokenness around us,。
to be the manifold wisdom that you have foretold。
and be the light and the salt to the world around us.。
Thank you, Jesus.。
Pray this in your son's name, amen.。
So thank you all for joining us for our service today.。
We have some refreshment prepared by Kelly outside.。
So I would encourage you all to stay after our service。
and hang out and enjoy some light refreshment.。
You are dismissed.。
