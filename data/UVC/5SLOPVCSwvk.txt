[no audio]。
Well, good morning. I just want to start by saying how grateful I am to be here。
and how grateful I am to you all for having me and my family here.。
[Cantonese]。
We love Urban Voice and love the time that we've spent here, and being here today is really special for us.。
It feels like a little reunion seeing a lot of good friends again, so it's a blessing.。
[Cantonese]。
And this time of year is a special time of year, time of year that I enjoy when we celebrate Christmas.。
[Cantonese]。
I enjoy the get-togethers like today, the food, the decorations, all of those things.。
[Cantonese]。
I even like the Christmas movies, all the good ones and the cheesy ones that are on TV all the time this year.。
[Cantonese]。
But this morning I want us to think a little bit about the meaning of Christmas and what the heart of the meaning is.。
[Cantonese]。
Because Christmas is much more than just the gifts and the decorations and the lights and the time with family and friends.。
Those things are wonderful, but the meaning is deeper than that.。
[Cantonese]。
So let's look at a few verses in the book of Luke, chapter 2.。
[Cantonese]。
We're going to read verses 8 to 14.。
[Cantonese]。
These verses come from right after the birth of Jesus.。
[Cantonese]。
Jesus has just been born in Bethlehem in the stable.。
[Cantonese]。
And the Bible tells us that there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.。
[Cantonese]。
An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.。
[Cantonese]。
But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid.。
[Cantonese]。
I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.。
[Cantonese]。
Today, in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you.。
[Cantonese]。
He is Christ, the Lord.。
This will be a sign to you.。
You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.。
[Cantonese]。
Suddenly, a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel.。
[Cantonese]。
Praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest."。
[Cantonese]。
And on earth, peace to men, among whom his favor rests.。
[Cantonese]。
Now these verses tell us that the birth of Jesus was good news, really good news.。
[Cantonese]。
In fact, verse 10 specifically tells us it was good news of great joy to all people.。
[Cantonese]。
But why? Why was it such good news?。
[Cantonese]。
Why was this such a special event?。
[Cantonese]。
To begin to answer that question,。
[Cantonese]。
we have to zoom out a little bit and consider the place of the Christmas story in human history.。
[Cantonese]。
The Bible details to us God's work throughout history.。
[Cantonese]。
And although the Bible contains many different stories,。
[Cantonese]。
it's really one big story.。
[Cantonese]。
One grand narrative that runs from beginning to end.。
[Cantonese]。
It has a lot of different climatic moments.。
[Cantonese]。
And the Christmas story is a climatic moment in the Bible.。
[Cantonese]。
But it's not the beginning of the story.。
[Cantonese]。
And it's not the end of the story either.。
[Cantonese]。
To start to grasp the importance of the birth of Jesus,。
[Cantonese]。
we need to go back to the beginning of the story。
when God began to work with humans.。
[Cantonese]。
The story of the Bible begins with the act of creation.。
[Cantonese]。
Now before creation there was God.。
[Cantonese]。
The scripture tells us that he has always existed.。
[Cantonese]。
He has no beginning or end. He is uncreated. He has always been.。
[Cantonese]。
Earth did have a beginning and so did we.。
[Cantonese]。
God spoke the earth into existence.。
[Cantonese]。
He created out of nothing from the force of his power and wisdom.。
[Cantonese]。
And he made everything on the earth including us.。
[Cantonese]。
God created us and made us uniquely in his image.。
[Cantonese]。
Nothing else that he made was made in his image.。
[Cantonese]。
Humans are very special in that regard.。
[Cantonese]。
Now being made in his image means many beautiful things for us.。
[Cantonese]。
But one thing that it means is that we are relational。
beings.。
[Cantonese]。
God created us for relationship.。
[Cantonese]。
He created us for a right and healthy relationship to him.。
[Cantonese]。
And for right and healthy relationships with one another.。
[Cantonese]。
But not long after the moment of creation,。
[Cantonese]。
there was a problem.。
And it was us.。
[Cantonese]。
See, we as humans have always thought we're a little bit smarter than God.。
[Cantonese]。
And that we could really improve on the world he made if only we were in charge.。
[Cantonese]。
And the very first man and woman decided they didn't want to let God be in control.。
[Cantonese]。
They didn't want to follow his instructions.。
[Cantonese]。
They felt like they could do better making their own choices.。
[Cantonese]。
And so they chose to reject God.。
[Cantonese]。
And to reject his instructions for life.。
[Cantonese]。
And that was the first broken relationship.。
[Cantonese]。
The first breakup that happened.。
[Cantonese]。
And it wasn't God, it was us.。
[Cantonese]。
We're the ones who said, "God, it's not me, it's you. It's your fault."。
[Cantonese]。
"I want to go my own way and do things on my own."。
[Cantonese]。
And ever since that moment throughout time,。
[Cantonese]。
all of us have made that same choice.。
[Cantonese]。
All of us at some point have chosen to reject God.。
[Cantonese]。
And to pursue our own comfort and our own ideas and what seems best to us.。
[Cantonese]。
And that has led to all of the pain and the heartache of the human condition.。
[Cantonese]。
Instead of choosing right relationship with God and each other,。
[Cantonese]。
we choose to please ourselves.。
[Cantonese]。
And out of this comes selfishness,。
and greed and lust and oppression, hatred, wars, jealousy, racism, lies, betrayal, theft,。
the list goes on and on, all these things.。
[Cantonese]。
And the reality is there's not any one of us who hasn't done that.。
[Cantonese]。
Everyone in this room has at some point acted selfishly.。
[Cantonese]。
Or done something to hurt another human.。
[Cantonese]。
We've all done that, I certainly have.。
[Cantonese]。
All of us have sinned and fallen short of what God wants us to be.。
[Cantonese]。
But there's a glimmer of hope here.。
[Cantonese]。
And that is that God wasn't okay with a broken relationship.。
[Cantonese]。
God didn't want to leave it that way.。
[Cantonese]。
So God had a plan from the very beginning.。
[Cantonese]。
His plan was to restore and heal our relationship.。
[Cantonese]。
To make things right.。
[Cantonese]。
And to make a way for us to be forgiven.。
[Cantonese]。
God's plan was to send us something.。
[Cantonese]。
Or rather someone.。
[Cantonese]。
God didn't choose to send us a letter or a text or a voicemail.。
[Cantonese]。
Not an email or a DM or any other kind of message.。
[Cantonese]。
God sent his only son.。
[Cantonese]。
And that's who Jesus was.。
[Cantonese]。
The son of God sent on a rescue mission.。
[Cantonese]。
To heal and restore and ultimately save us.。
[Cantonese]。
That's why in verse 10 the angel says the birth of Jesus is good news of great joy.。
[Cantonese]。
Jesus was the first gift of the first Christmas.。
[Cantonese]。
And God gave this gift to all of us.。
[Cantonese]。
Every human that has ever lived or ever will live on the earth.。
[Cantonese]。
God gave us this gift of his son.。
[Cantonese]。
And through his son.。
[Cantonese]。
The gift of relationship with our creator.。
[Cantonese]。
But how is it that Jesus could rescue us?。
[Cantonese]。
And what was it about his birth that was so different than all the other births?。
[Cantonese]。
The Bible tells us that Jesus was and is someone very special.。
[Cantonese]。
Because he was the son of God.。
[Cantonese]。
He was fully God.。
[Cantonese]。
And yet also fully human.。
[Cantonese]。
The book of John chapter 1 tells us that Jesus is the word of God made flesh.。
[Cantonese]。
The revealing of all that God is.。
[Cantonese]。
That means all of God's justice, God's love, God's peace, and infinitely more than that。
brought together into human flesh.。
[Cantonese]。
Full of grace and truth.。
[Cantonese]。
Jesus was Emmanuel.。
[Cantonese]。
God with us.。
[Cantonese]。
Notice in verse 14, the original language doesn't just communicate peace to us.。
[Cantonese]。
It communicates peace among us.。
[Cantonese]。
Jesus was the manifestation of God.。
[Cantonese]。
Not just to show us who God is.。
[Cantonese]。
But to be with us.。
[Cantonese]。
To live among us.。
[Cantonese]。
And to make us able to live with God.。
[Cantonese]。
Jesus left the comfort of heaven to do this.。
[Cantonese]。
He made himself subject to all the limitations and brokenness of humanity.。
[Cantonese]。
So that he could rescue us.。
[Cantonese]。
Because he was human.。
[Cantonese]。
Jesus dealt with every struggle that we deal with.。
[Cantonese]。
He became tired.。
[Cantonese]。
He experienced hunger.。
[Cantonese]。
He got cold.。
[Cantonese]。
All of those things that happened to us.。
[Cantonese]。
He was also tempted to reject God and sin just like we are.。
[Cantonese]。
He was tempted to be angry.。
[Cantonese]。
To be selfish.。
[Cantonese]。
To lust.。
[Cantonese]。
To seek revenge on those who had wronged him.。
[Cantonese]。
He was tempted to be greedy and pursue his own comfort.。
[Cantonese]。
He was tempted to be lazy and to be fearful and to give in to his fears.。
[Cantonese]。
He was tempted to be consumed with anxiety and to be stressed and worried.。
[Cantonese]。
All the things that challenge us and hurt us.。
[Cantonese]。
He dealt with those same things.。
[Cantonese]。
But in all those temptations he didn't sin.。
[Cantonese]。
He didn't give in to any of those things.。
[Cantonese]。
He loved and served and healed those that he met here on earth.。
[Cantonese]。
And at the end of his life, he gave himself as a sacrifice for us.。
[Cantonese]。
He died on a cross.。
[Cantonese]。
Murdered in a way that he never deserved.。
[Cantonese]。
So that he could win life for us.。
[Cantonese]。
In a way that we never deserved.。
[Cantonese]。
He traded his perfection for our brokenness.。
[Cantonese]。
So that through him, we might find perfection and have our brokenness restored.。
[Cantonese]。
His death in our place gave us an opportunity to know our creator.。
[Cantonese]。
But he didn't stay dead.。
[Cantonese]。
After three days he was gloriously resurrected.。
[Cantonese]。
And he defeated death once for all.。
[Cantonese]。
He opened a doorway to freedom.。
[Cantonese]。
From sin and death.。
[Cantonese]。
He opened a doorway to relationship with our creator.。
[Cantonese]。
And he opened a doorway to heaven and eternal life for those who believe in him.。
[Cantonese]。
That's why his birth was good news.。
[Cantonese]。
It was the beginning of God's great rescue plan to restore us.。
[Cantonese]。
The arrival of Jesus was the first step in our healing.。
[Cantonese]。
And that brings us to another unique and powerful truth about the birth of Jesus.。
[Cantonese]。
And that is the intentional nature of Jesus stepping into our world.。
[Cantonese]。
He did it on purpose.。
[Cantonese]。
Have you ever thought about the fact that Jesus actually chose where he would be born?。
[Cantonese]。
He's the only person in history who's been able to do that.。
[Cantonese]。
If you could go back and choose your birth,。
[Cantonese]。
your family, where you would be born,。
[Cantonese]。
maybe there's something that you would change.。
[Cantonese]。
But Jesus did have the opportunity to choose.。
[Cantonese]。
He could have been born anywhere to any parents.。
[Cantonese]。
But he chose to be born to an unknown, poor, and hard-working couple。
from a tiny, struggling town in an oppressed country.。
[Cantonese]。
When Jesus was born,。
[Cantonese]。
Rome ruled his homeland.。
[Cantonese]。
A Caesar sat at the pinnacle of human power in Europe.。
[Cantonese]。
And the Han Dynasty sat at the pinnacle of human power in Asia.。
[Cantonese]。
There were kings throughout the world.。
[Cantonese]。
Influential families,。
[Cantonese]。
wealthy clans,。
[Cantonese]。
people with palaces and grand estates.。
[Cantonese]。
And riches and servants and animals.。
[Cantonese]。
But Jesus didn't choose to be born there.。
[Cantonese]。
He didn't choose to be born in a capital city.。
[Cantonese]。
Or in a palace.。
[Cantonese]。
He chose to be born in a country that was suffering under heavy oppression.。
[Cantonese]。
He was born in a small town so full of travelers,。
[Cantonese]。
that his parents couldn't even find a decent room.。
[Cantonese]。
He was born in a place where animals were kept.。
[Cantonese]。
And his first bed was literally a feeding trough.。
[Cantonese]。
This shows us clearly that Jesus。
[Cantonese]。
purposely entered into our brokenness.。
[Cantonese]。
He didn't just barely approach us and hold his nose to get away from the stench.。
[Cantonese]。
He didn't just come around the corners of our brokenness and mostly avoid it.。
[Cantonese]。
He dove straight into the middle of our human mess.。
[Cantonese]。
He saw us at our very worst.。
[Cantonese]。
And he loved us there.。
[Cantonese]。
And he knowingly walked straight into all of our chaos.。
[Cantonese]。
And that's good news.。
[Cantonese]。
That is such good news.。
[Cantonese]。
Because we humans are still a mess.。
[Cantonese]。
Our lives are still full of brokenness and chaos.。
[Cantonese]。
We have struggle and hurt and pain.。
[Cantonese]。
But Jesus showed us beyond a shadow of a doubt。
[Cantonese]。
that our brokenness doesn't keep him away.。
[Cantonese]。
He's here to fix the worst that we could have to offer.。
[Cantonese]。
There's nothing too broken that he can't fix.。
[Cantonese]。
There's nothing or no one too dirty that he can't cleanse.。
[Cantonese]。
There's no pain or hurt too deep that he can't heal.。
[Cantonese]。
And there's nothing so dark that he cannot forgive it.。
[Cantonese]。
And that is good news.。
[Cantonese]。
News of great joy to all people.。
[Cantonese]。
That's why the birth of Jesus was such a big deal.。
[Cantonese]。
That's why heaven was celebrating that night.。
[Cantonese]。
Stars were moving in the heavens.。
[Cantonese]。
Angels were singing.。
[Cantonese]。
That's why we still celebrate.。
[Cantonese]。
Over 2,000 years later,。
[Cantonese]。
we still talk about that night and we sing about it.。
[Cantonese]。
Because of what it meant.。
[Cantonese]。
Jesus stepped into our brokenness to bring healing.。
[Cantonese]。
Now there are just three points of application。
[Cantonese]。
I want us to think about as we close.。
[Cantonese]。
First of all, perhaps there are some people here today。
who don't have relationship with Jesus.。
[Cantonese]。
Maybe you've never heard much of this story before.。
[Cantonese]。
Maybe you always thought Christmas was just about Santa。
and presents and ugly sweaters.。
[Cantonese]。
[Laughter]。
Maybe even Christmas is a difficult time for you,。
something that you don't really like.。
[Cantonese]。
That's okay.。
[Cantonese]。
Maybe your life is messy.。
[Cantonese]。
The good news for you。
[Cantonese]。
is that's why Jesus came.。
[Cantonese]。
If you're experiencing brokenness。
[Cantonese]。
if there's difficulty in your relationship with family and friends。
[Cantonese]。
or in your marriage or your job。
[Cantonese]。
or your emotional or mental health。
[Cantonese]。
or your finances or you're trapped in some type of addiction or pain。
[Cantonese]。
the good news for you。
[Cantonese]。
is that Jesus has chosen to show up。
[Cantonese]。
right where you are。
[Cantonese]。
in the middle of all the pain and brokenness。
[Cantonese]。
and there's nothing he can't fix.。
[Cantonese]。
If you're willing to believe on him。
[Cantonese]。
and follow him。
[Cantonese]。
then he'll begin to heal your mess。
[Cantonese]。
and bring you back into that healthy and right relationship with God。
[Cantonese]。
that you were created for.。
[Cantonese]。
This is the good news for you.。
[Cantonese]。
Jesus has seen you at your worst。
[Cantonese]。
and loved you.。
[Cantonese]。
Call out to him for help。
[Cantonese]。
and if you're open to relationship with him。
[Cantonese]。
he's waiting with open arms for you.。
[Cantonese]。
Second。
[Cantonese]。
maybe you're here today and you already have relationship with Jesus。
[Cantonese]。
maybe you've had that relationship for a short time or a long time。
[Cantonese]。
but there's still some mess in your life。
[Cantonese]。
just because we're a Christian, a follower of Jesus。
[Cantonese]。
doesn't mean everything is easy。
[Cantonese]。
we still struggle。
and have pain and hurt。
[Cantonese]。
the good news for you。
[Cantonese]。
is that the same Jesus who saved you。
[Cantonese]。
wants to be at work in your life right now。
[Cantonese]。
redeeming the mess。
[Cantonese]。
fixing those broken things。
[Cantonese]。
healing you。
[Cantonese]。
turning the ashes of your failure and my failure into the beauties of his grace。
[Cantonese]。
if you're in that position this morning。
[Cantonese]。
maybe you're trying to hide some of those messy corners of your life in your heart。
[Cantonese]。
from Jesus。
[Cantonese]。
but if you're burdened and struggling。
[Cantonese]。
cast your cares on him。
[Cantonese]。
surrender to his work in your life。
[Cantonese]。
and ask him for healing。
[Cantonese]。
open every door of your heart to him。
[Cantonese]。
and invite him into those places of hurt and brokenness。
[Cantonese]。
and see what miracles he can work。
[Cantonese]。
with your heart and with your life。
[Cantonese]。
the third thing I want us to consider。
[Cantonese]。
is if you are a person who's a follower of Jesus。
[Cantonese]。
then I want to remind you。
[Cantonese]。
that Jesus has given us an example to follow。
[Cantonese]。
he left a place。
[Cantonese]。
of perfect comfort。
[Cantonese]。
and peace。
[Cantonese]。
and tranquility。
[Cantonese]。
to come here。
[Cantonese]。
to come to this。
[Cantonese]。
our brokenness。
[Cantonese]。
and he did it out of love。
[Cantonese]。
as his followers。
[Cantonese]。
he's called us to do the same。
[Cantonese]。
to carry his love。
[Cantonese]。
into the messy places around us。
[Cantonese]。
into the messy lives around us。
[Cantonese]。
into the places that are broken and chaotic and hurting。
[Cantonese]。
Jesus calls us to follow him in this way。
[Cantonese]。
he calls us。
[Cantonese]。
to help others。
[Cantonese]。
come into that right and healthy relationship with God。
[Cantonese]。
and that's also good news for us。
[Cantonese]。
as his followers。
[Cantonese]。
not only has he given us right relationship to God。
[Cantonese]。
but he's given us purpose。
[Cantonese]。
and a pathway to serve him。
[Cantonese]。
and to love others。
[Cantonese]。
so may each one of us be encouraged。
[Cantonese]。
this joyful good news。
[Cantonese]。
may we hear and receive the words that the angel shared。
[Cantonese]。
do not be afraid。
[Cantonese]。
I bring you good news。
[Cantonese]。
great joy。
[Cantonese]。
that's for all the people。
[Cantonese]。
good news for you。
[Cantonese]。
good news for me。
[Cantonese]。
good news for our neighbors。
[Cantonese]。
and may our voices rejoice with the angels。
[Cantonese]。
as we look at what God has done for us。
[Cantonese]。
and we say glory to God in the highest。
[Cantonese]。
and on earth peace to men。
[Cantonese]。
on whom his favor rests。
[Cantonese]。
let's pray。
[Cantonese]。
God I just thank you this morning。
[Cantonese]。
for what you did。
[Cantonese]。
when you left the comfort of heaven。
[Cantonese]。
to step into our broken and messy world。
[Cantonese]。
you did it out of love for us God。
[Cantonese]。
God I pray that we would encounter your love this morning。
[Cantonese]。
wherever we're at in life。
[Cantonese]。
all of us have hurt。
[Cantonese]。
all of us have fears。
[Cantonese]。
all of us have brokenness。
[Cantonese]。
may we encounter your love。
[Cantonese]。
in those places this morning。
[Cantonese]。
and may from this place。
[Cantonese]。
may we carry your love。
[Cantonese]。
to the hurting world around us。
[Cantonese]。
in Jesus name we pray。
[Cantonese]。
Amen。
