I am going to teach you how to use Premiere Pro.。
If you already know the basics, please skip to Part 2.。
This is Part 1 for those who have not used it yet.。
First, you open the program and click New Project.。
I usually don't change all the settings.。
What you need to change is to make sure your location.。
Make sure you open a new folder.。
Make sure you set up everything.。
Give it a title.。
This time I am using Premiere Pro Video Editing Part 1.。
After opening it, you will see what it is.。
You don't have to worry about a lot of things.。
You can adjust everything.。
Basically, these four boxes can be moved freely.。
You can move a lot of things.。
For example, if you press the tool box, you can drag it to another place.。
Yes, you can drag it up.。
But everyone has their own preference.。
So don't move things around.。
For example, go to Tools.。
You can drag it down and put it in your preferred position.。
The most important thing is to import your files, audio, video, and pictures.。
So you will see the "Import Media to Start" at the bottom left of my screen.。
You can right-click here and you will see "Import".。
But if you don't have this, you may not see it when you first do it.。
Go to the file above and find "Import".。
It will be the same.。
First, you can choose a video or a picture.。
But sometimes, if there are some files that are not clear in the name, you may not remember what it is.。
There is a way to see it.。
Just highlight the name and double-click the icon.。
You will see it pop up in a corner.。
That window is your preview window.。
My setting is in the upper left corner.。
You can see the video by clicking the "Play" button.。
It's a preview, right?。
If you are a picture, you can see it.。
But you can't play it.。
You can see the timeline is moving, but it won't move the other days.。
It's a picture.。
As for the audio, you can play it.。
There is no topic, but there is sound.。
That's it.。
How to start making videos?。
You can see the timeline in the bottom.。
It's like your workspace.。
For example, I want to put a video in the timeline.。
There are two ways.。
First, you can drag it directly.。
You hold and drag it.。
Or you can click the "Left" button on the cursor on the screen.。
You can drag it to the timeline.。
That's it.。
You can start your timeline.。
You can see the video is about 10 to 15 seconds.。
The video can be extended or shortened by clicking the "Short" button.。
You can see the video is getting shorter and shorter.。
You are looking at the video getting longer and longer.。
You can see the video is 1 minute and 30 seconds.。
This is the function of zoom in and zoom out.。
The above function is called V123.。
You can play more than one video.。
You can adjust the height.。
You can also add audio.。
If you have a lot of audio or videos,。
you can right-click on the space next to the eye and click "Add Track".。
If you want to add more tracks, you can click "Delete Track".。
It will ask you if you want to delete the track.。
You can highlight and uncheck the tracks.。
I will tell you the difference later.。
You can mute the audio tracks.。
For example, I want to add a picture.。
You can click "Add" and click "Picture".。
When you play the video, the picture will be changed.。
I will add one or two more videos to show you the difference.。
I will keep clicking "Video", "Picture", "Video", "Picture".。
I will add Tony's audio.。
You can see that I can't add audio because there is a "Video" button.。
I will add the audio.。
If you make a video, you will see that Tony's audio is very long.。
I will add a lot of audio to fill up the space.。
I will make the audio short this time.。
You can see that the audio is not long.。
We need to adjust the time.。
I have a music player, so I will play the music.。
This is the final product.。
I only have a few pictures.。
I want to make the audio longer.。
What can I do?。
First, the picture is long and short.。
When you highlight the picture, the cursor will be on both ends.。
When the cursor is on the end of the picture, the red bracket will be changed.。
This is to shorten the picture.。
The picture will not move, so it will stay in the same position.。
You can drag the picture as long as you want, but it will not move.。
If I want to undo, I will press "Ctrl + Z".。
I will play the music.。
I want to make the audio longer, so I will play the music.。
The video can be long or short.。
I will adjust the duration.。
Now the duration is 100%.。
I will adjust the duration to 50%.。
Why is the duration not changed?。
Actually, the duration is not changed.。
I can play the music longer.。
The video was long, but now it is longer.。
When I play the music, the video will be slower.。
Can you see it?。
The video is much slower.。
I will shorten the video.。
The video is longer, but the video is shorter.。
If the video is shorter, the duration is 150%.。
Now the video is only 16 seconds.。
The video is shorter.。
The video will be faster when I play the music.。
This is how you play with video.。
What else can be changed?。
For example, I need this picture to be 10 seconds long.。
But I am bored.。
There is a trick.。
Go to the "At the beginning" of the timeline.。
Go to the "Back 1 frame" of the timeline.。
This is a very useful trick.。
This is still a video of a girl.。
This is the picture.。
How can I adjust the duration of this picture?。
How can I make this picture not boring?。
There is a way.。
Zoom in and zoom out.。
First, highlight the picture.。
Then, click on the "Preview" box.。
Then, click on "Effect Controls".。
Then, click on "Highlight Picture".。
This is a little complicated.。
The program reads each frame.。
At the beginning of the frame, the frame rate is 100%.。
The position is 960x540.。
There is a stopwatch.。
First, click on the stopwatch.。
Then, you will see two points.。
What is strange?。
I will zoom in a little.。
You will see three small points.。
At this time, the program will know the frame rate is 100%.。
I want to make it 200% now.。
You can see the frame rate is bigger.。
I want to zoom in the picture.。
But I want to zoom out after 5 seconds.。
So, you have to click on the "Add Keyframe" button.。
You have to add a command here.。
Click on this frame.。
You can see two points.。
The computer knows what to do at this moment.。
You can choose the frame rate you want to change.。
Click on the stopwatch.。
At this time, the frame rate is 200%.。
But I want to change it to 100% at this time.。
What should I do?。
I will zoom out now.。
But you don't have to do every frame in between.。
You just need to tell the program that you want to change the frame rate to 100% at this time.。
Then the program will play out the zoom function smoothly.。
I will play it for you.。
Don't just look at the bottom.。
You have to look at the top.。
I will show you again.。
It is zooming out.。
Now your video is not so boring.。
Because you have something moving.。
Although you are playing the picture.。
Zoom in and zoom out.。
Just move the scale is one of the ways.。
But do you remember that I asked you to put the stopwatch in the position?。
In addition to the scale, you can also play with the position.。
Okay, let's go back here.。
This is the final product.。
I want them to be like this.。
But at the beginning, I want the woman to be a little higher.。
What should I do?。
960 is like a vertical axis.。
Horizontal and vertical.。
When you put the cursor on the 960, you will see two arrows.。
You can hold it and move it left and right.。
You will see that the picture is actually moving.。
For example, I want to focus on a black man.。
Or maybe these two black people.。
At this time, focus on these two black people.。
But when I go outside, I want it to go back to the middle.。
I just need to move one time frame.。
Now when you play, there are different effects.。
You can play with this setting in many places.。
But remember the original position.。
When we put the picture in the middle, the settings of Premiere Pro are usually 986 and 540.。
540 is the top and bottom.。
If you don't remember, press 540.。
The number in the middle is 960 and 540.。
You can see that the screen is a little slow.。
I set it to full resolution.。
If you see the screen is moving, I usually set it to 1/4.。
Then the screen will be smoother.。
If you notice, I added a little more.。
Because I adjusted the settings.。
If you don't want to do anything, you can add more.。
You can highlight it individually.。
After highlighting, press delete to delete.。
Of course, you can press Ctrl + Z to undo.。
You can play with the picture to make it more vivid.。
Zoom in and zoom out.。
Zoom in and zoom out from the left and right.。
You can also adjust the time.。
You can also zoom in and zoom out.。
You can also do this function.。
For example, you can zoom in on this woman at the beginning.。
Then slowly zoom out.。
You can also see the background on the side.。
You can see that the transition between each video is quite boring.。
Because when you play, it suddenly changes to another one.。
How to make a more interesting transition in the middle?。
This is called dissolve.。
It is not called transition in this program.。
How can I do this?。
You can go back to the import box.。
You can see the top of each box.。
If there is a double arrow, you can press it.。
Then look at the effects.。
It's not effects control.。
It's effects control.。
Then it tells you that there are many presets, audio transitions.。
You can slowly cut it.。
But if you know your function, you can type it directly.。
These transitions are called dissolve.。
You haven't finished playing, but it's usually out.。
It's out.。
There are many different dissolves.。
It's actually a transition.。
For example, cross dissolve.。
Highlight it and drag it down.。
Just put it at the end of the box.。
I want to show you something.。
I just went to the effects.。
Where did I go?。
You just have to press the project button.。
You will be back.。
I found something.。
If you have two pictures.。
I have two pictures on the side.。
Put a transition in the middle of the two pictures.。
Go back to the effects.。
When you put cross dissolve here,。
You can see that I can put the dissolve in the middle of the two pictures.。
You can see that the two pictures are highlighted.。
You can put it on the left.。
On the right.。
But it's also in the middle.。
This is the dissolve function.。
Put it in the middle of the two pictures.。
When it transitions, it's called cross dissolve.。
You can see it slowly.。
Cross because both will appear at the same time.。
Then dissolve to another.。
A very smooth transition.。
If you like this style.。
If you don't like it, you can change to another.。
For example, if I don't want it, I can highlight it and press delete.。
I can dip it to black.。
You can see that the glow will be black and come out.。
Or dip to white.。
There are many different dissolve methods.。
There is a method called film dissolve.。
I think it's the same as cross dissolve.。
What I want to say is that no matter what you are,。
This dissolve transition can be very long and short.。
First highlight it.。
Then you will see that when the control box is opened,。
You will see that something pops out.。
I usually don't need to use the top one.。
I just need to do it here.。
Because after highlighting, you can see that the cursor is in the film dissolve box.。
There will be a red bracket.。
Press it to lengthen it.。
Just do it like this.。
You can go to the preview box.。
When you mouse over, you will see many different buttons.。
First, you can press the lengthen button.。
You can see that it is only lengthened one side.。
It is different from the previous one.。
Both sides are lengthened evenly.。
If you see this symbol,。
You can move the box forward and backward.。
There are different effects.。
Because when you move it forward,。
The left hand picture will disappear very quickly.。
The right hand picture will come out very quickly.。
There are different effects.。
I usually don't press the transition.。
I usually put the mouse in the middle and press the left hand button.。
It will be fine.。
If you have the same nature,。
It is easy to do the same thing.。
But if you want to do the same thing,。
Between a video,。
This is a video.。
This is a picture.。
I found that sometimes the cursor can't drop exactly in the middle.。
You see, I can't drop the cursor in the middle.。
What should I do?。
I can highlight the cursor.。
Remember that we have this function.。
Go to the effects control.。
There is this function.。
I can do it here.。
I put the cursor in the middle.。
I want the dissolve transition to be longer.。
I can drag it back.。
Sometimes you will find that the cursor can't be placed in the middle.。
You can try to move it to the effects control.。
You can play around with it.。
This is one of the transition methods.。
How to dissolve, how to transition.。
You can cross dissolve, dip to black, dip to white.。
These are very basic.。
You can find it here.。
It is what we need to do for now.。
If you think it is clean cut,。
It will be better if you jump to another place.。
You don't need to put anything between the clips.。
After talking about video, let's talk about audio.。
I have muted two audio clips.。
Let's listen to the audio.。
Let's listen to it.。
The background music is very good.。
But when Tony talks,。
I can't hear him at all.。
What should I do?。
I want to keep the background sound.。
The level is really good.。
What should I do?。
You can do one thing.。
Highlight the background.。
How to adjust the volume?。
If you want to lower the volume of the audio at the same time,。
There are two ways.。
First, highlight it.。
Right click, go to audio gain.。
You can see that it only changes the volume.。
You can increase the volume.。
Press positive number,。
Press 5, press 10.。
You can see that the volume is reduced.。
You can increase the volume.。
Press 5, press 10.。
You can see that the volume is reduced.。
You can increase the volume.。
If you want to decrease the volume,。
you can press negative.。
For example, I think it's better to increase the volume.。
You can decrease the volume.。
You can see that the volume is reduced.。
You can see that the volume is reduced.。
Let's listen to it again.。
It seems better.。
But Tony's voice is still very low.。
So I will increase the volume.。
I will increase the volume.。
Press 5.。
Let's listen to it again.。
It's better.。
Maybe...。
When Tony speaks,。
the background should be quieter.。
But the beginning of the background is very good.。
I don't want to increase the volume.。
I don't want to reduce the volume.。
What should I do?。
Can I just increase the volume?。
Yes, you can.。
But if you increase the volume,。
the sound will be too loud.。
You should reduce the volume.。
There are two ways.。
First,。
you can turn the audio。
into two audio.。
You can turn the audio into two audio.。
You can keep the same sound in the beginning.。
You can reduce the volume in the end.。
But the sound will not be as beautiful.。
Because the sound will be very awkward.。
The sound will be very awkward.。
How can you slow down the sound?。
How can you slow down the sound?。
First,。
put the timeline cursor。
a few frames before Tony speaks.。
put the timeline cursor a few frames before Tony speaks.。
Highlight the audio.。
Preview the box.。
If you don't turn on the effect controls,。
turn it on.。
If you don't turn on the effect controls,。
turn it on.。
If you don't turn on the effect controls,。
turn it on.。
This is called "Levels".。
Remember,。
you are asking the computer。
to do something at this time.。
So you need to set a time.。
Press the stopwatch button.。
Press the stopwatch button.。
Press the stopwatch button.。
You can see the diamond.。
You can see the diamond.。
It means the computer knows what to do.。
But what should you tell it?。
You want the sound to be。
quieter from here.。
