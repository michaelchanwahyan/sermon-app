(speaking in foreign language)。
- Well, we have a very special speaker today, all right?。
And Wasam asked me, is he the first Arab。
in our congregation, I think, right?。
You're the first one, right?。
Iraqi, right?。
And he's a native Iraqi, and he's from Baghdad, Iraq.。
How many of you have been to Baghdad, Iraq?。
(audience laughing)。
One, okay, all right.。
And he, through a very dramatic experience,。
came to Christ in Baghdad, Iraq.。
And he will tell you more about his story.。
Now he's Associate Minister of Sunset Church of Christ。
in Taylor, Michigan.。
Taylor, Michigan, you've been there, right?。
Michigan, you've been there, right?。
State of Michigan.。
And his vision is to tell Muslims about Christ。
and to tell Christians about Islam.。
And I think this is a very relevant topic today.。
Our coworkers, our friends, our neighbors,。
maybe Muslims, or maybe they believe in Islam,。
and they love to tell you about their faith。
and how to respond as a Christians.。
So a very, very relevant topic.。
And Wasam has also written two books.。
The first one is "I Am an Arab and I Am a Christian."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
The second book he has written is "Islam in Christ's Eyes."。
It's a scripture study, it's a group study guide。
to help you understand Islam from a Christian perspective。
and how to respond to Islam.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Wasam, we wanna welcome you.。
- Thank you.。
(audience applauding)。
Thank you.。
Good morning.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
It is so surreal that I'm invited in one weekend。
to talk in two Chinese congregations.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I started the Arab Christian ministry.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Upon my graduation。
from Sunset International Bible Institute.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Locally, I work from my church, preaching the gospel。
to the predominantly Muslim population。
in the neighboring Dearborn, Michigan.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And globally, I work as the adjunct assistant dean。
for the Arabic studies。
with Sunset International Bible Institute.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And yet, I think you are never famous。
until you have your name said in Chinese.。
(audience laughing)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I was born to a Muslim family in Baghdad in 1979.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
A few months after my birth,。
Saddam Hussein became our president.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And Ayatollah Khomeini led the Islamic revolution。
in the neighboring Iran.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And we started to have the war。
between the two countries that lasted for eight years.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I was born and raised in a classic example。
of a world that was not told to love one another.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
A world that is not shaped by the goodness。
and the love of Jesus Christ.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Shortly after the war, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
We had the sanctions that lasted for 13 years。
in which my whole family lived on $1 a month.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And we had the Gulf War of 1991.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Up until that point,。
Saddam Hussein was a secular socialist military dictator.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But after he had a Shiite revolt in the south,。
(speaking in foreign language)。
he realized he could not impose a secular system。
on the predominantly Muslim people of Iraq.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So after he crushed that revolt,。
he started to put on a show of Islam.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He wrote Allahu Akbar on the Iraqi flag.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He ordered the Quran to be taught。
in all the Iraqi schools.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He built hundreds of mosques all around Iraq.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And he started to turn the Iraqi community。
from being secular to being more Muslim.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
My father retired in 1992.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And my mom started working as a seamstress,。
mending the clothes of our neighborhood。
to provide for the family.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I was in the middle of my teenage years,。
in the middle of the 1990s.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
When Iraq was officially at enmity。
with everything that is different in the world.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
We did not have the terrorism and the car bombs。
and Al-Qaeda that is ravaging the Middle East now.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But all of that was a culture that was preached in mosques.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Taught in schools.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And propagated by the government's limited channels.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Hate was preached everywhere.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
It is hate that eventually caused me。
to convert out of Islam.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Hate is evil, whether it is in Iraq。
or in America or in China.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
We did not starve for food or water。
because of the sanctions years.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But we were starving for a different kind of bread。
and a different kind of water that we did not even know.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
My four year old sister passed away in 1996.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
My mom, a panicked mother,。
and the funeral of her daughter was--。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Was begging for someone at the funeral。
to provide her with a glimpse of hope。
that that innocent child went to heaven.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
No one was able to provide her with that hope.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And the only man who was knowledgeable in the Quran。
told her she will be judged for the very first breath。
she took in when she was born.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
A few months later that same year.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
My uncle got cancer.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He was the uncle that I loved most.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He was so kind and so generous and so humorous.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But when I last saw him,。
he would cry every time I talk with him.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Not only because he saw his death coming,。
which he did in a few days.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But for the first time in his life,。
he was unable to go to the bathroom.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
To get ritually clean for the Muslim prayers.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He was in bed, soiling himself.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He thought God was done with him.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And he died without hope.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
That's when I decided that's it,。
between me and God,。
rejected Islam and became an atheist.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I thought I would be happy if I were an atheist.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But somewhere deep inside me,。
I was looking for justice and for a sense of direction.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I wanted to entertain and distract myself.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I started to think about the world。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I started reading books,。
listening to music and watching movies.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Most of the books that I read quoted the Bible.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I got curious to get myself a copy of the Bible。
only to understand these quotes.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I was in my second year in college。
studying civil engineering.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
When the first Mission Impossible movie was released.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Tom Cruise picked the Gideon's Bible and read Job 314.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
That was the first time I see the Bible.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I got so curious.。
I went to a flea market in Baghdad。
and bought my first Bible.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
It was the Gospel of John.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I thought that was the entire Bible.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I did not find Job 314 in the Gospel of John.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So I thought Muslims were right.。
Everybody is making up a different Bible.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Something caught my attention in the Gospel of John though.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
The way Jesus addressed。
the hypocritical religious authorities of his time.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Something you're not supposed to do in a Muslim community.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I was born and raised to two devout Muslim parents.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And they taught me that every Imam。
is a steward of God's word.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And we should not question them.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Well, not Jesus in that book.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
It was the summer holiday。
between the second and the third year in college.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
When I was back at that flea market。
flipping the New Testament.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I saw the Gospel of John in the New Testament.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
That was the first time I realized。
that the Gospel of John was not another Bible.。
It was part of a bigger book.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So I bought the New Testament.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
A few days later,。
I realized that the New Testament。
was part of another bigger book.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So I realized that I lost a lot of money already.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And bought my first complete Bible.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I was so shocked to see the accurate historical。
and geographic description in the Bible。
of a world that I am familiar with.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Babylon, that's 50 miles to the south of my parents' house.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Babylonians and Assyrians,。
these are the native Iraqis.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Nebuchadnezzar, his poster is next to Saddam Hussein's。
picture in every street corner in Baghdad.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
The captivity, the pride of the Iraqi history。
that we studied in the seventh grade.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I'm sorry.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And I was thinking, man, the guy who made up this book。
really knew his history and geography.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
A Christian philosopher once said.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
That there are three things that we all need.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And these are first, truth.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And then goodness.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And then beauty.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But he said what we want is the exact opposite order.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
We want beauty first.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And then goodness and then truth.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
The beauty of the Bible caught my attention first.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
It is the most influential and most beautiful piece。
of literature that was ever written.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Then I fell in love with the goodness of the Bible.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
A book that preaches love and not hate.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Peace and not violence.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Forgiveness and not vengeance.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Integrity, benevolence, you name it.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And I fell in love with the Bible for being good。
way before I believed in the Bible for being true.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I had so many questions to ask.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I did not have any Christian friends.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But when the third year in college started,。
I saw a man with a cross in his shirt in our class.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He obviously flunked the third year.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I asked him, are you a Christian?。
Do you know your Bible?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He said, go ahead.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I said, do you Christians believe that you are saved。
by God's grace or by your obedience?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Like every other preacher,。
he did not directly answer my question.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But he took the opportunity。
to introduce the gospel message to me.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He explained to me how God is a holy and just God。
that does not tolerate sin.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But at the same time, he's a loving God,。
so he sent his son to take our sins on him。
and die on the cross for us.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
It's a combination of God's grace and our obedience.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I said, interesting.。
One more question.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Do you really believe that?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He said, oh yeah, we do.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Next day, he brought me some literature。
that talked about how many tens of thousands。
of Bible manuscripts we have today in the museum.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
From different times, from different places,。
written in different languages.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And they all match each other.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
That was the first time anyone tells me。
that the Bible has not been corrupted.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I was 19.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I was so happy to learn that the book。
that has the solution to every problem。
my community is suffering from turned out to be true.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I was so happy to learn that the book。
that was both beautiful and good turned out to be true too.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I thought everybody else would be as happy.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I was wrong.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
The first person I tried to share the gospel with。
was the woman that I loved the most.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
My mom used to wake up before me。
to make breakfast for me every day.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And at that time, she would not answer me。
when I say good morning, mom.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
One morning I asked mom, what's wrong?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
She turned to me and she grabbed me by the collar.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And she asked me, please tell me。
what did I fail to provide to you?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
That you do this thing to me.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I said, what thing?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
She said, I've been working day and night。
to make a human being out of you.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I've been wearing my eyes out on that sewing machine.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
To send you to school.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And you've been using my money to buy that blasphemous book。
that I've been seeing among your college books.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Look at yourself, grow up.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
With that,。
with the lack of wisdom and the lack of encouragement.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
With the fact that I started to lose。
many of my Muslim friends。
and did not gain any new Christian friends.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And with the fact that I started to get harassed。
by the religious authorities in my neighborhood.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I came to that point where I thought,。
maybe this is all wrong.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Maybe there is no God.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Maybe the gospel was just another philosophy。
I wanted to entertain and distract myself with.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I renounced the Christian faith and gave away my Bible.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
A few months later,。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I realized,。
(speaking in foreign language)。
that the hope and the satisfaction,。
(speaking in foreign language)。
and the fulfillment and the assurance,。
(speaking in foreign language)。
that I had when I claimed God's promises。
in the Bible as my own,。
(speaking in foreign language)。
cannot be replaced with anything in this life.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I'd rather be a persecuted Christian with hope,。
(speaking in foreign language)。
than a comfortable non-believer with no hope.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So I got a new Bible.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
In English this time, so my mom would not understand it.。
(audience laughing)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And I continued to read the Bible in secret。
for the rest of my stay in Baghdad.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
My biggest discouragement was that it would take me 12 years。
going to every single church building in Baghdad。
trying to get baptized in faith.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I finished school in 2000.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Finished my service as a Republican guard in 2002.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
America invaded Iraq in 2003.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
We started to have the internet。
and we started to be open to the outside world.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I would go online and download sermons and Christian songs。
and upload them to my MP3 player。
and listen to them on my way to work every day。
and read the passage from the Bible.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Until that one morning in 2009.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
When my workplace, the Iraqi Department of Public Works.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Was rocked by a truck bomb.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I was in the staircase, I came out of it without a scratch.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
We moved to a substitute building。
in another neighborhood in Baghdad.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
That building had an internet cafe next to it.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
One afternoon I signed up for a free Bible study.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And that's when everything started to change.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
A woman was assigned to grade my Bible tests.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
She asked me in her first email if I had any prayer requests.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I said, "Would you please pray that I can get baptized?。
"I've been a believer for 12 years already."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And would you please pray that I can live。
in a Christian-friendly community。
where I can say Jesus is Lord。
without getting killed right on the spot.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
That same day I came across a free book called Bible Basics.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Written by a British man who had a ministry in Latvia.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I ordered a free copy of that book.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He ended up coming to Iraq and baptizing me。
in a bathtub in Kurdistan, Northern Iraq.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
The woman that used to grade my Bible tests。
was a caregiver for a quadriplegic man。
in a Christian man's house in Pennsylvania.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
The Christian man told her if that Iraqi plans。
to come over here, he can stay with us.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
A few weeks later, the American embassy in Baghdad。
started issuing visas for Iraqis。
for the first time in 20 years.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So I applied for the visa.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Bought the plane ticket.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Packed one bag.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Said the final goodbyes to my family.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Flew all the way from Baghdad to New York City.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Came to this nation with one bag.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
With only enough money to survive for weeks.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And with one contact, a poor woman in the Amish country.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
One Christian man there heard my story.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He had me speaking in his church in Pennsylvania.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
The preacher of which turned out to be a graduate。
from the school I eventually ended up going to.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
He raised support money for me to go to school。
on the time I ran out of the last dollar。
that I brought with me from Iraq.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I finished school and moved to the Detroit area.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Back to the Muslim community,。
the same community I escaped from.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Eight years ago, I used to hide my faith to stay alive.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And today, I share my faith to make a living.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Once again, appreciate your invitation.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And your time and thank you and God bless.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(audience applauding)。
Thank you very much.。
Well, we still have five minutes。
and maybe there are some questions from the congregation。
and we wanna ask you or you wanna answer。
if you have an answer.。
I am all yours.。
(audience laughing)。
Do you guys have any questions?。
Yes, ma'am.。
- Oh, Emily, please get a mic.。
- Can you tell us how bad they would treat Christian。
back in like Iran or Baghdad that you used to,。
well, before you leave?。
- There is much more to,。
well, they are persecuting Christians in Baghdad。
that you would know.。
Okay, learn the basic facts first.。
When I was born and raised,。
that was under Saddam Hussein。
who was a member of the Ba'ath Party。
that was established by a Greek Orthodox Christian.。
The Iraqi Prime Minister,。
the international face of Iraq, Tariq Aziz,。
was a Catholic Christian.。
And so there has not been any persecution。
on a religious basis under Saddam Hussein.。
Now, after Saddam Hussein,。
we still have a civil constitution。
and we still have a lot of Christians.。
In fact, my boss in Baghdad when I was an engineer。
was a Catholic woman,。
but the government is not strong enough。
to impose law and order.。
When a car bomb explodes in an Iraqi marketplace。
and kills 99 Muslims and one Christian,。
that story will be reported somewhere。
as a Muslim persecuting Christians.。
I think there is much more to the stories。
that you can hear, at least from Baghdad,。
from what I saw in Baghdad,。
than what you see from your end.。
Christians are being persecuted everywhere。
and more severely in the Muslim countries。
than here in the United States,。
but there is much more to the story.。
- Any other questions?。
(audience laughing)。
How many-- - Yes, ma'am.。
- Oh, sorry.。
- I'm interested to know how did you tell your mom。
and your family when you leave the country?。
- Okay.。
Good question.。
My mom first did not take me seriously.。
Then she took me seriously and she was really sad.。
Then right before I left, she said,。
"I know that you are doing the right thing,。
"but promise me one thing.。
"You do not join a drug dealing gang."。
(audience laughing)。
So that's the only thing she knew about America.。
I said, "No, Mom, I'm not gonna do that.。
"I would never do that."。
Unfortunately, things in Iraq started to go。
from bad to worse at that time.。
It's not as bad anymore.。
So ISIS came into the scene and more people got killed.。
And my mom eventually said, "You have always been wise.。
"I have never told you that,。
"but I knew that you were doing the right thing."。
My whole family knows about my conversion。
and my work now and they are fine with it.。
In fact, the first book that I wrote,。
the book that exposes Islam, actually that's the second book.。
The first book is "Islam in Christ's Eyes."。
I told my mom, "I wrote a book that exposes your faith。
"as bad and false and I dedicate it to you."。
She said, "I'm proud of you."。
(audience laughing)。
- Right there, Steve.。
- Sir.。
- Can I get a mic?。
- You made your mom change her view.。
- Time.。
- Time?。
- Yeah, you only have one chance。
to offend somebody with the gospel message.。
Two decades later, no one really cares.。
(audience laughing)。
- So you cast the bombardment。
of the gospel message, basically?。
- Well, no, my family are still all devout Muslims.。
And yeah, I mean, to be tolerant and receptive。
and respectful is one thing.。
To, for their hearts to be convicted of their sin。
and for them to really feel that they need a savior,。
that is a different thing.。
It's always harder with the family.。
I mean, when I first started to tell my mom about the gospel。
she told me, "Are you saying that you are right。
"and this whole world is wrong?"。
To her, the whole world is Islam.。
And so, yeah, I mean, it took time.。
That's the only thing.。
Yeah.。
- Well, as I said in the introduction,。
we have some friends or neighbors or co-workers。
who are in the Islamic faith.。
We are Christians and what are the pointers。
that you can share with us, how to share the faith,。
how to connect with a Muslim neighbor?。
- Okay, long story short, show them the love of Christ。
before you show them the truth of his gospel.。
'Cause people are interested in what is beautiful first。
and then what is good and then what is true.。
I have a whole course on that called Islam in Christ's Eyes。
that starts with, see, when you preach the gospel to anyone。
you will have to start where they are at now.。
And so what Muslims believe now and where to start,。
the theology of Islam explains the element。
of the Islamic faith, I talk about that.。
And to understand how things ended up。
the way they are at now in the Muslim world,。
you will have to have a basic exposure。
to the history of Islam.。
So history and then theology and then how to preach。
the gospel to Muslims, this all is a course。
that is called Islam in Christ's Eyes。
that I'm giving now in, what's the name of the congregation,。
the other Chinese congregation that I'm talking to?。
They have the name in Chinese characters,。
I have no idea. (audience laughing)。
And they gave me a ride here and a ride there.。
And so, before you share the gospel,。
okay, before you ask how can I share the gospel,。
you will have to ask an equally important,。
if not a more important question,。
why should I share the gospel with them?。
What is the motive when you want to share the gospel?。
What is the proper motive if you wanted to share the gospel。
with your non-Christian neighbor?。
Here is the right motive.。
When you share the gospel with your neighbor,。
Muslim or non-Muslim, remember that if they responded。
to that message of salvation,。
you will be stuck with them for all the eternity.。
Is this what you really want or not?。
If you don't love them that much,。
if you cannot stand seeing them in your neighborhood,。
don't you dare preach the gospel to them.。
Move on and preach the gospel to somebody else。
that you really like.。
So start with the proper motive first,。
and then the means, and then the opportunity.。
And no, we are not trying to murder anybody here.。
(audience laughing)。
- All right, so let's give a round of applause to Wissam.。
- Thank you.。
- Why don't we pray together?。
- Sure, please.。
- We pray for his ministry in Michigan.。
We also pray for more Arab people coming to Christ.。
- Thank you.。
- All right, let's pray.。
Father God, we just want to give you thanks。
because you are the God of the whole world,。
and you love every one of us with grace,。
and with love, and with beauty.。
We pray for Wissam.。
We praise you for how you have led him to come to Christ,。
to come to know the gospel,。
and come to the United States to start the ministry,。
to preach Christ to many Muslims in his neighborhood.。
We just pray that you will continue to use him,。
use his story, use his experience, his knowledge,。
to bring many to Christ, for your glory.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
- Amen.。
- Thank you very much.。
- I appreciate that, thank you.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(audience laughing)。
- Oh, wow.。
- That's right.。
- Is that all the Chinese you can speak?。
(audience laughing)。
- Yeah, and I got that from Brush Hour.。
- All right, so.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Islam in Christ's Eyes.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I am a Christian.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
