Most minds of fiction on the planet can't even begin to comprehend or understand how。
great things are going to be, how glorious our future is, our hope in heaven is, where。
our bodies and minds are perfected, the heavens and the earth perfect, perfect justice, perfect。
peace, perfect love, utter perfection.。
And according to Paul, all of this is utterly glorious.。
And therefore, our present sufferings are nothing but a mere drop in an infinite ocean。
of glory and perfection.。
And so that right there is why he can endure suffering and why he can say it's only temporary。
and it's only light, because he knows something is coming that is so much greater.。
And then Paul continues.。
He doesn't stop there, although he could, but he continues to explain how great this。
future glory is that allows us to persevere through suffering.。
The next two verses, Paul says this.。
"For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.。
For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of。
the one who subjected it in hope."。
So, Paul continues by painting this picture, he gives us this analogy that all of creation,。
the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the hills, the oceans, everything is waiting。
for this coming moment in anticipation.。
And the reason that it's waiting is because it has been subjected to frustration, it says.。
And the reason that all of creation, as good as it is, has been subjected to frustration,。
we see all the way back in the beginning, in the opening chapters of Genesis, when God。
subjected creation.。
You see that when the fall of man happened, when sin entered the world through Adam and。
what him and Eve did in the garden, God not only cursed Adam and Eve, but he also cursed。
the ground.。
He cursed creation.。
And the reality that creation has been subjected, it's evident everywhere you look in a lot。
of different ways.。
Like I said before, our bodies are always breaking down, but the earth itself, all of。
creation is also breaking down and things are not right, they're not as they should。
be.。
And so you can think in creation, what examples of this do we see in nature?。
Earthquakes and tsunamis that destroy so much.。
Forest fires and droughts where you have whole nations burning for days, weeks on end.。
Those things, we call them natural disasters, but they're not really natural.。
That's not the original way God created the earth.。
That came when sin came, when God subjected the world.。
You can also see this, if any of you guys in here are like into physics, maybe you're。
a little bit nerdy like me, you know about the second law of thermodynamics?。
Anybody know what I'm talking about?。
Okay, okay, I'll break it down for you guys, I'll break it down for you guys, okay?。
So the second law of thermodynamics, simply put is that everything is winding down.。
Everything is going from a state of order to disorder.。
So things are always breaking down.。
As soon as you buy a car, you drive it off the lot, immediately loses its value.。
You buy a house, over time it breaks down, the pipes, they're leaky, the roof needs。
to be replaced, everything is always breaking down.。
And this is true even in our own lives, I'll give you guys a little bit of an example。
for myself, I'll be honest.。
As the years go by and I look back at pictures of myself from college or from high school,。
I'll always ask my wife, Kiamia, just be honest with me, Kiamia, you know, look, is。
my hairline falling back, okay?。
I have to wonder, because everything is winding down, eventually all these beautiful locks。
will be gone.。
My dad is bald, my grandpa's bald, it's coming for me one day.。
That's just the reality, and it's goofy, it's kind of silly, but it's true.。
Everything in creation is winding down.。
But even in this frustration, there is a hope.。
Even for creation, there is a hope.。
And so what is that hope?。
Paul explains in the next verse.。
That the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into。
the freedom and glory of the children of God.。
And so this hope, even for creation, is the emancipation of all creation from the bondage。
to corruption.。
That there is a certain glory that all of creation, like the children of God, will freely。
receive when God makes all things new.。
And it is this beautiful new creation that you can see in Revelation chapter 21, chapter。
22, when the universe will no longer trend in the direction of death, disease, and decay.。
There will be no more disorder.。
All things will be restored to perfect order.。
And this future is so great that Paul gives us this picture of all creation waiting, anticipating。
to see what is brought about when that glorious future comes to fruition.。
And again, Paul just continues building upon this picture, building this metaphor to underscore。
the greatness of the glory to come.。
And I want to explain here the reason that Paul is doing this.。
He's explaining how great it is and the glory to come and that creation is growing.。
And because this is all building into that very first point of how we can deal with our。
suffering is by looking to a future hope.。
So I want you guys to kind of get a sense of this weight of the future glory, how awesome。
it is.。
Paul really, really goes to great lengths to get his readers to understand how great。
it's going to be because that will help us deal with suffering.。
And so he says in verse 22 and 23, "We know that the whole creation has been groaning as。
in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.。
Not only so, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit grown inwardly。
as we wait eagerly for the adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies."。
So Paul gives us this, and I think this is like the perfect metaphor for what he's teaching。
here about suffering, is the metaphor of childbirth.。
And as I mentioned before, my wife, 38 weeks pregnant, we've been doing these childbirth。
education classes once a week.。
And we go to the class, and we have to learn how to prepare, what labor is like, how to。
get ready, make sure your bag is packed, make sure you have the car seat in the car.。
And one of the things that I've had to watch is childbirth videos.。
And, okay, if there's any moms, fathers in here, even if you're not a mom or a father,。
you know a mom, okay?。
And so there's just something about childbirth that if I were to describe it, I would say。
that it's not a quiet situation.。
It's not the most peaceful, serene, quiet environment.。
It's kind of a noisy thing.。
And a lot of these videos I've seen, these women when they're in labor, they're just。
groaning is the best word you can say.。
They're not really saying words.。
They're just groaning in anticipation.。
And I was thinking that maybe I would give you an example, but I'm not going to do that.。
I'm not going to, you know, that's loud.。
But you get the idea.。
It's just this groaning and it's wordless, but they're just longing and waiting for this。
baby to come into the world.。
And so we can learn from childbirth some beautiful truths about our own suffering.。
And months and months of pain and sickness and suffering, it teaches us something that's。
true for everyone.。
And so when we think about childbirth, we think about this beautiful way in which God。
has designed us to bring life into the world.。
There's three things we can learn from this about our own suffering.。
The first is that it is absolutely temporary.。
So for all the moms out there, could you imagine living in a world where you did not know that。
nine months was like the limit?。
Imagine living in a world where you could be pregnant for nine months, but you could。
also be pregnant for nine years, and you just didn't know.。
Okay?。
You just did not know when it was going to come to an end.。
Imagine how hard that would be.。
Okay?。
And as tough as those nine months are, you always have this thought in the back of your。
head, "Okay, 40 weeks.。
Okay, if I can get to 40 weeks, okay, I can handle it.。
I got two weeks left.。
I got one week left.。
I can do this."。
Right?。
And so the fact that the suffering is temporary, it gives you some peace as you bear it.。
It gives you some hope and some encouragement.。
And the second thing is that suffering is absolutely purposeful.。
When a woman is pregnant, all that, the sickness and the aching and the pains, it's not pointless.。
All of it is a part of God's beautiful process of bringing life into this world.。
And so all of that pain is purposeful.。
And so it just, it allows you to suffer it and bear it a little more because you know。
God is using all of this for a beautiful and glorious purpose.。
And that none of my suffering is purposeless.。
And the last thing, and I think the most beautiful thing, is that all that suffering is absolutely。
worth it.。
I've talked to so many moms over the past few months, getting advice and asking them。
about their experience.。
And the one thing they'll always tell me, well, two things.。
The first thing, they'll always agree that it is difficult, that it is not easy.。
But the second thing they always say is that that moment when they first saw their little。
baby girl, or they first held their baby boy to their chest, all the pain, all the suffering,。
it just melts away.。
It becomes one of the happiest moments of their life.。
And the pain is replaced with pure joy, right?。
And so all of that suffering is absolutely worth it.。
And so this is true in childbearing, but it's also true in creation.。
And it's true for us that suffering in this fallen world is only temporary and it's not。
purposeless, but it will be absolutely worth it.。
And so we can know confidently that this future day of glory is coming, not just for creation,。
but for us also.。
And we can know that, Paul says, because God has given us a guarantee.。
He has given us a down payment, and that's the Holy Spirit.。
He says that the Holy Spirit is the first fruits.。
And this is a concept we get from Scripture where when the produce came, when it was time。
for the harvest, the Israelites would give a first fruit offering to God, knowing that。
He would make sure that their crops came in again during the next harvest and they had。
enough food to eat.。
And so that first fruit offering, it was like this trusting in God, this guarantee of what。
is to come.。
And so the Holy Spirit serves a similar purpose for us.。
He is a guaranteed down payment.。
He is a promised portion of a coming fullness.。
And again, that fullness, that glory, that future hope allows us to persevere when we。
suffer in this life.。
Paul continues, verse 24 and 25, "For in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen。
is no hope at all.。
Who hopes for what they already have?。
But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently."。
So we're hoping, we're waiting for this future glory.。
We may not have it yet.。
We may not see it yet, but we know it's coming and we have the confident assurance that it。
will come.。
And I want to make a point to explain that when you read in the Bible about hope, that。
biblical hope, true hope, as Paul is talking about here, it is not just like a regular。
sense of hope.。
It's not like a kid who writes a Christmas letter and is hoping to get his favorite toy。
and he might get it, but he might not.。
That's not the kind of hope we have.。
We have a hope that is grounded in the promises of God, a God who doesn't lie, who doesn't。
change his mind.。
And so we have a hope that is assured, that we know will come to pass.。
It's a confident assurance that we have.。
And it's because of that confident assurance of the future glory to come that we can eagerly。
and patiently wait through our sufferings.。
So, all of that metaphor and analogy and word picture Paul gives us leads us to our first。
answer, our first answer to the question of suffering, how can we deal with suffering?。
It is by knowing and believing in this future hope to come, this glory that's unimaginable,。
that outweighs any suffering you can experience in this life.。
That coming glory is so great we can bear under any suffering and difficult circumstances。
in this life.。
But Paul continues, and we're going to see now a second reason how we can endure suffering。
in this life.。
Verses 26 to 27 says, "In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness.。
We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through。
wordless groans.。
And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes。
for God's people in accordance with the will of God."。
And the beautiful thing about this is that we do not suffer alone.。
A lot of people have this, a lot of people in the world who reject the idea of God.。
They say things like, "I just can't believe in a God who allows suffering.。
I can't believe in a God who just sits back and does nothing while people suffer."。
And the truth is, I would not believe in that kind of God either, because that is not the。
kind of God we have.。
We have a God who, one, not only entered into the world to suffer as the world suffers,。
but we have a God who in the Holy Spirit is with us in our weakness, in the midst of our。
suffering, so that we don't have to be alone.。
And even when we don't know why we suffer, even when we don't know quite what to pray。
for or how to respond to suffering, Paul says that the Holy Spirit knows what we need, and。
the Holy Spirit is going to God the Father, interceding on our behalf, because on one。
hand, the Holy Spirit who's inside of us knows exactly what we need.。
On the other hand, the Holy Spirit knows the mind of God, and He knows the exact will of。
God, so we can be confident that even when we're in a moment of weakness and we don't。
know what to say to God, how to pray, what to do, the Holy Spirit who knows us and knows。
the Father's will goes to God on our behalf.。
And those things that we need, those requests taken to God, in His will, will be done.。
And so we have that confidence that God is with us, God is always working about His will,。
and that's exactly what we need.。
A question that can arise that Paul's going to answer in this next verse, though, is what。
exactly is the will of God?。
If the Holy Spirit, when we don't know what to pray for, is interceding, working for us。
to achieve the will of God, what exactly is the will of God for us in the midst of our。
suffering?。
Paul says in verse 28, "And we know that in all things, God works for the good of those。
who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose."。
So God's will is our good.。
God is working all things out for our good.。
And that can be difficult to imagine.。
Just think about it.。
Do we truly believe that God is working all things for our good, that God is working cancers,。
criticism, rejection for our good?。
Just as much as He is working beautiful things, pleasurable, amazing things for our good,。
God is working all things for our good.。
And therefore, even when we suffer, our suffering is not meaningless.。
It is not purposeless, because God is even using suffering for our good.。
And I think that's such a beautiful truth, that our suffering is not meaningless and。
is not purposeless, because take a second and think about a world in which there is。
no God.。
And for many people on the planet, this is the world that they think they live in, a。
world with no God, no Creator, no ultimate meaning, no ultimate purpose, no right or。
wrong.。
In that kind of a world, our suffering is totally meaningless.。
In that kind of a world, we're just creation, we're just accidents, not even created.。
That sometime in the past, there was just something that happened in the midst of nothingness。
and created the world, but there's no intended order or no design.。
And so we ultimately have no purpose, we have no Creator.。
And so when we suffer, we just suffer.。
It's not good, it's not bad, it just is what it is.。
That kind of life is depressing and it's sad, but that is not the reality we have, because。
we do know there is a God in heaven, and He's sovereign, and He rules and reigns over。
everything and uses all things for our good.。
So even when we suffer, there's a meaning, there's a purpose behind it, and we can be。
comforted because we know that meaning and purpose is for our good.。
One thing I do want to say about this verse, because it's a very popular verse, and it's。
easy to pull this verse out of its context, and it's easy to try to spin this verse into。
a way Paul did not intend.。
So what Paul is not saying is that God is going to do whatever you think is good, that。
God is going to give you whatever you think is good, and that if you think money and riches。
and car and all success and every avenue of life is what's going to happen, that's not。
what Paul is saying, because Paul is somebody, again, he knew what it was like to suffer.。
He knew what it was like to be rejected, to be despised, to be hated, to be hungry, but。
that's not because Paul was outside of God's will or disobedient to God.。
He was obedient to God and still experienced those things.。
The truth of what God really wants for us, and that's not to say that He doesn't ever。
want us to have nice things and have good things.。
There are times when He does, but the ultimate good that God is working out, and what Paul。
is talking about here, is not exactly what the world may define good to be.。
Paul is going to define what that ultimate good is.。
In the very next verse, he says this, "For those God foreknew, He also predestined to。
be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brothers。
and sisters.。
And those He predestined, He also called.。
Those He called, He also justified.。
Those He justified, He also glorified."。
So you can see what Paul is saying here is that our ultimate good is to be conformed。
to Christ, is to become like Jesus Christ.。
That is the ultimate good that God always desires in every situation, and God uses everything,。
all things, every situation to that end, to make us like Jesus Christ.。
That is the ultimate goal of our lives, as followers of Jesus Christ, is not to get rich,。
is not to be the most popular, or the most well-liked and respected, but is to be like。
Jesus Christ.。
No matter what circumstances we find ourselves in, we should long to be like Christ, to think。
like Christ, to love like Christ.。
That is what God wants for our lives.。
And we see that not only do these verses reveal what God is working all things for in our。
lives, but it also reminds us the reason that we can be confident of these things, that。
we can be absolutely assured that God's got us, is because in this verse, in this passage,。
we see what, for generations, for centuries, the church has celebrated, and it's often。
called the golden chain of salvation.。
And it's the reason that we can be confident that God has us, and gives us assurance that。
he's holding us, he's keeping us safe, like an anchor who holds a boat down.。
God has this, because Paul says, "Those whom God foreknew, he predestined to be conformed。
to the image of his Son.。
And those he predestined, he called.。
Those he called, he justified.。
Those he justified, he glorified."。
And Paul is writing these verbs here, called, predestined, justified, glorified.。
And even though that glory we know is a future glory, Paul's writing about these things as。
if they've already happened, as if it's a present reality that we already are glorified.。
And what Paul is doing is telling these readers that if you have been predestined by God,。
foreknown by God, which doesn't mean that he just knew of you, which is true of everyone.。
God knows everything, and therefore, from the beginning of time, God knew everyone.。
But those who God foreknew, he loved in a special way.。
He knew in a special, intimate way.。
And those who he foreknew, he predestined.。
Those he predestined, he called.。
Those he called, he justified.。
Those he justified, he glorified.。
That's a confident thing, that if you have been foreknown by God, it's already a done deal.。
You're glorified by God, as if it's already happened.。
And so that is how we can be so confident of these things.。
Even when we suffer, even when it seems like things are not going right, this right here。
gives us so much hope.。
And so we see here that second reason that we can suffer.。
One is because there's a future glory coming that is so great, no amount of suffering can。
even begin to compare.。
And number two is that we are never alone in our suffering.。
God's always with us.。
And he has been before the world was even created.。
And now the third reason we see here of why we can endure this suffering is because none。
of our suffering is meaningless.。
It all has a reason.。
It all has a purpose.。
And so those are three things that are just so encouraging in the midst of our suffering.。
God's working all things for our good, so our suffering, it is not meaningless.。
There's a reason behind it that is good for us, that's great for us.。
And that truth that many worldviews, many philosophies and religions don't have this。
hope in the midst of suffering that we have.。
Those three things that can keep us grounded in the midst of our suffering.。
And I think that there's a beautiful example of this all the way as far back as, again,。
the book of Genesis and the life of Joseph.。
We see these truths at play when Joseph, loved by his father but hated by his brothers, was。
betrayed, thrown into a pit, sold into slavery, goes into the land of Egypt, and then he's。
harassed and falsely accused by his master's wife.。
Then he's put in jail, and he's left in jail, and he helps these two guys who were formerly。
working in the house of Pharaoh.。
He helps one of them get back into Pharaoh's good graces.。
And Joseph tells this cupbearer of Pharaoh, "When you get back into Pharaoh's household,。
tell him about me so that I can get out."。
And when the man gets back into Pharaoh's household, he forgets about Joseph.。
And Joseph spends even more time falsely accused, wrongly imprisoned.。
All of this, through all this suffering, we see God is still with Joseph.。
God never leaves Joseph.。
God never lets Joseph suffer for no reason.。
We start to see that God is working in the midst of all this because the time comes when。
Joseph is called up.。
He gets his chance.。
He goes before Pharaoh.。
He interprets Pharaoh's dream favorably.。
It comes to pass, and he gets elevated to the second most powerful position in Egypt,。
all because God was always working through his suffering.。
And a famine comes across all the land, and because Joseph, through God, saw it coming,。
he had stocked up grain and food.。
So when all the different peoples in the nations around Egypt have to come receive grain,。
his brothers, who set this whole thing in motion, throwing him in the pit, selling him into slavery,。
they come to him now to get help from him so they can live.。
And they don't really realize it's him.。
There's this kind of back and forth that occurs.。
But in the very end of this narrative, we see that he is kind of restored to them.。
He accepts them.。
He reveals himself to them, to his father.。
There's joy.。
They're celebrating.。
But when their father, Jacob, dies, the brothers get scared, because now they think that Joseph。
is going to get revenge.。
There's no one to stop him.。
But when they come to him in fear, trembling, he tells them not to fear.。
And he gives this beautiful verse, I think sums up the story, the life of Joseph so perfectly,。
and it exemplifies what we're talking about in Romans chapter 8.。
Joseph tells them, "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good, to accomplish。
what is now being done, the saving of many lives."。
So we see that God is sovereign over everything.。
And it's not that what his brothers intended for evil, God used for good, as if God had。
to create a plan B and scramble to figure out, "How can I turn this bad situation out for good?"。
What he says is that, "You intended to harm me.。
God intended it."。
So God was already sovereign over their decision, over their choices, using it for Joseph's good.。
That's exactly what Paul is bringing out in Romans chapter 8.。
That's the same thing God does for us.。
He's always working, he's always using all things, suffering included, for our good.。
So when we think about this beautiful truth, one, that God is using all things for our。
good, which means our suffering is never purposeless or meaningless.。
Two, the Holy Spirit is working on our behalf, always interceding, so that when we suffer,。
we're never alone.。
And three, when we suffer, we have on the other hand, this future glory that is so great,。
it makes all our suffering pale in comparison.。
Those three truths give us a new perspective on how to handle suffering in this life.。
And so when we suffer now, we don't need to ask the question, "Why me?。
Why am I suffering?。
How could I ever get through this?"。
We should ask ourselves, "What can I do now in my suffering with these beautiful truths,。
with what God has revealed?。
How can I apply them to my life to persevere through the suffering, or to encourage someone。
close to me who is also suffering?"。
So I want to leave you guys with three final questions and three final exhortations to。
take this word to heart, that we could all use it, be encouraged by it, and apply it。
in our lives to the glory of God.。
So, brothers and sisters, when you suffer, are you tempted to give up hope?。
Are you tempted to lose faith?。
Remember that your suffering is temporary.。
It will not last forever.。
It cannot last forever.。
And not only that, but the future glory to come, which will replace that suffering, is。
guaranteed to come, and it's so amazing.。
It's so great.。
It's perfect.。
It's glorious.。
And it totally outweighs any suffering you can face in this life.。
So look beyond your suffering.。
Fix your eyes on the glory that is to come, and keep your hope in that which is unseen.。
When you suffer, are you tempted to believe that you are alone, or that no one is there。
to help you?。
Are you inviting the Holy Spirit in the midst of your suffering and weakness to help you?。
Remember that even in your weakness, the Holy Spirit is there for you, interceding on your。
behalf, taking your needs to God, and the will of God will be done in your life.。
Rely on the Holy Spirit.。
Depend on His working in and through your weakness.。
Turn to Him when you suffer.。
And lastly, when you suffer, are you tempted to believe it's all for nothing?。
Do you truly believe that God works all things for your good, that your suffering is not。
meaningless?。
Remember that, as Paul says, the truth is that God does work all things for your good.。
For those who love God and have been called according to His purpose, and we saw that。
this purpose has been in play from before the foundation of time.。
And that's how you can be confident that God is and will work all things for your good.。
And this means that your suffering is never in vain.。
God's always working for you in eternal weight of future glory, even in the midst of your。
suffering.。
Know that your Heavenly Father is good.。
He's taking care of you.。
No matter what we go through in this life, God is there for us, and He's got us for all。
eternity.。
Trust in Him.。
Will you please pray with me?。
Heavenly Father, Lord our God, I just want to thank you.。
Thank you that you have given us this perspective on suffering, that you have given us a future。
hope that we cannot even fully comprehend, but we know it is so great, so glorious.。
Any suffering we face in this life utterly pales in comparison.。
Thank you, God, that you do not leave us to suffer alone, but that you have given us your。
Holy Spirit who helps us in the midst of our weakness, who takes our request to our Father。
in Heaven, and that His will will be done in our life, that all things will be worked。
out for good.。
And we thank you, Father, that none of our suffering is meaningless, none of it is in。
vain or futile or purposeless, but that you are using it all for your good, which is our。
good.。
Help us, Father God, to in all things become more like Jesus Christ.。
Please take this word, hide it deep in our hearts so that when we suffer, we will know。
that we have hope, or when that someone near us is suffering, we will be able to share。
that hope with them.。
And please, Father God, put a burden in our hearts to take this good news, to take this。
gospel of hope to a world that desperately needs it, so that those who do not know about。
this hope, who don't know that there is purpose in all suffering, that all things can be worked。
for good, help us to take this gospel to them, Father God, that they would receive the blessings。
and the hope that is found in no other name than Jesus Christ.。
We thank you for this day.。
We thank you for this opportunity to be here to hear your word, Father God.。
Just pray that you would sanctify us by your word.。
And I ask all these things in Jesus' precious name.。
Amen.。
