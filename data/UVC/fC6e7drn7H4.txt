Welcome to all of you.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
I have a very short message to you.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
This is a very important message, okay?。
Even though it's a short message, but a very, very important message.。
And this verse in the Bible says,。
"Give thanks in all circumstances,。
for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Now, you have to pay attention.。
The Bible does not tell us that we have to give thanks for everything,。
including evils, including injustice, including sufferings in our lives.。
The Bible is not telling us to do this.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
The Bible does not tell us to give thanks for everything.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
The Bible is telling us, "Give thanks in all circumstances,。
including unhappy circumstances,。
including some of the painful moments that we have."。
We can give thanks, and we have the resource。
to give thanks in all of these circumstances.。
That's what the Bible is talking about.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Now, we thank God.。
We can thank God to be with us,。
to be present with us in hard times, in difficult times.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
And we can thank God that nothing,。
including unhappy moments, all of this happened outside,。
nothing outside of his wisdom for us.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
I don't know if you have played this game called "I Spy."。
And I give you an amazingly detailed picture,。
and you have to find what I want you to find.。
Have you ever played that, "I Spy"?。
Something like this.。
In a very complicated picture,。
you have to find the happy, smiling onion, all right?。
Can you see that on the right?。
You can find it, right?。
Why don't we do this game right now?。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Of course, you can find it right now,。
but I'm going to show you a picture, the first picture,。
and you have to find me the happy, smiling onion, all right?。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Why don't we do it by table, okay?。
Why don't we do it by table, okay?。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
See if the people around the table can find the happy onion, all right?。
The first one is this one, all right?。
So let's find the happy onion, all right?。
Happy onion.。
If you find it, raise your hand, okay?。
Now, I must tell you there are three.。
There are three happy onions here, okay?。
Where is it?。
Where is it?。
Okay, is it on the right?。
Is it on the right?。
On the right or on the left?。
Okay, there's a big one right there,。
and then there's a right one in the lower right.。
And can you find the third one?。
This table can find the third one.。
Where is it?。
Bottom left, yes, yes, yes.。
Can you find it?。
Yeah, these are the happy onions.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Okay, now you have to pay attention.。
Okay, now how many of you couldn't find it?。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
I'll give you a second chance, all right?。
Second one, ready?。
Okay, we do it by table, all right?。
Here's the second one.。
All right, I'm sure you can find the first two.。
Yeah, where's the third one?。
Where's the third happy onion?。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Where is it?。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
You can find it?。
Okay.。
Why is it taking so long?。
Oh, you got it?。
Where is it?。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Oh, there are many.。
Okay, all right, here we go.。
All right, there you go, there you go.。
How many of you find it?。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Go on, happy onion.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Well, let me give you the last one, okay?。
Let's try it, all right?。
Ready?。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Here.。
Where are the onions?。
Of course, you can find the first one and the second one.。
Where is the third one?。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Again, you guys?。
Oh, because they're closest to the TV, all right.。
Yeah, right there.。
Wano, where is it?。
It's like right there, right there.。
Okay, all right.。
Here are the onions.。
The happy onions, happy onions.。
Well, this is something what we do when we give thanks, all right?。
The exercise of giving thanks or finding things to give thanks for。
is kind of like finding the onion, the happy onion,。
in the complicated picture.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Now, it's much the same way, okay?。
The Bible is not trying to tell you positive psychology.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
The Bible is telling you there is an understanding of God。
behind giving thanks.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
God has everything in control.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Now, what happened this year for you,。
I'm sure it's kind of like this picture, very complicated.。
So I want you to do one thing for me,。
to look for ways that you should be thankful for this year.。
So far, we have gone through 11 months in this year.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Now, you have to think.。
You have to rewind.。
Rewind what happened this year.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
And look for things you might have missed.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
And things you can be thankful for.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Now, this is what the Bible says.。
It's a cultivation of your life.。
Cultivate your spirit so that you can center on God。
who is in control and God who is leading you all the way through.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
There's a famous African-American writer called Alex Haley.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
And in the office of Alex Haley, he's a very famous novelist.。
And in his office, there was a picture called "Turtle on Fencepost."。
"Turtle on Fencepost."。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
And why does he hang this picture in his office?。
He says, "Every time I begin to feel proud of myself,。
I look at the turtle on top of the fencepost,。
and remember, the turtle did not get there on his own.。
He had help."。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Now, I think this is the perfect analogy for our life.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Of course, this phrase "post-turtle" is often used politically.。
Talk about dumb politician.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
But this is an analogy for our life.。
We didn't get there by ourselves.。
We had help.。
And ultimately, God has helped you.。
God has brought you to this place, to this spot.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
So, in the season of Thanksgiving,。
we can call this "Give Thanks Because Of."。
Give Thanks Because Of, because every time you look at this picture,。
as Alex Haley said,。
we don't get there by ourselves.。
We had help.。
And ultimately, God had helped us.。
That's why we thank God.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Now, we can call this Thanksgiving exercise。
"Give Thanks Because Of."。
Give Thanks Because Of.。
You have success and you have come to this place。
because of the well-being God has granted you,。
because of shelter and security.。
That should not be taken for granted.。
Because of the opportunities that is right in front of you。
so that you can grow, and that is granted by God.。
And the small joys in your life,。
that should not be taken to be granted.。
And ultimately, Jesus Christ and His cross,。
the love of God, the grace of God to be with you,。
that should not be taken granted for.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
This is what we call "Give Thanks Because Of."。
Right?。
So try to rewind this year.。
What had happened to you?。
What have you gone through?。
Think about the grace of God.。
Think about the providence of God.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
And then there's another level of giving thanks.。
Not only giving thanks because of.。
It's giving thanks even though.。
Giving thanks even though.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Even though there were challenges and setbacks in your life,。
there's more inconveniences, frustrations that happened this year.。
Unanswered prayers, perhaps many of those.。
Imperfections in your life.。
Imperfection struggles, flaws that make you more real.。
Make people more real.。
Make your family and your relationships more real,。
more authentic.。
So think about some difficulties you have faced this year。
to help you grow in resilience,。
to help you grow in patience.。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
the encouraging prayers。
that knows how to be rejected.。
These things...。
God gave to us.。
God made us go through。
these trials and 1957。
these hardships when we were university student so we could go forward。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
We must remember Jesus Christ and His cross。
even though all this happened。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
A life of thanksgiving。
Now as we close our today's worship。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
I want to invite you to give thanks。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
And we want to do something together as a church, as a family。
as a spiritual family。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
And on your tables。
you find some ribbons。
some broken ribbons。
some strips of ribbons。
these ribbons are for gifts。
okay, wrapping up a gift。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Now I want you to do something together。
let's do something together。
let's rewind what had happened this year。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
What is worthy of giving thanks?。
Right, either setback or challenges or opportunities。
or something that is good。
some blessings in your life。
count the blessings and count the things that we should be thankful for。
and I want to invite you to use the permanent marker。
to write it on the ribbon。
alright, this is your gift of giving thanks。
alright, let's take a moment。
to think about what we can give thanks for this year。
and think about it, it takes time。
look into the details。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
Now I want to invite you to do so right now。
it can be very general。
in the well-being, health, success。
small successes in your life。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
I want you to write it on the ribbon。
I want you to do one thing today。
if God has reminded you。
at least one thing you should be thankful for。
maybe one thing you have missed to give thanks for。
I want you to write it on the ribbon and then you bring it up here。
you can leave your seats and after you have written。
the items of Thanksgiving on the ribbon。
you can hang it on the cross in front of me。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
or do a small prayer。
you say, "God, thank you"。
you write it down and bring your ribbon。
and hang it on to the cross in front of me。
[speaking in Cantonese]。
