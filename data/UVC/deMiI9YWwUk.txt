Hello, everyone!。
Welcome back to Family Sunday School.。
I'm Ms. Rebecca.。
Today is the 7th episode.。
Have you noticed anything different about Ms. Rebecca today?。
Her hair is different, right?。
She's wearing a pony tail.。
Do you know what a pony tail is?。
"Ma" is horse. "Mei" is tail.。
So what is a pony tail?。
Pony tail!。
Ma is pony tail.。
Ma Mei!。
Pony tail.。
And what color is Ms. Rebecca wearing?。
You can't see it now, but her top is black.。
Her bottom is also black.。
All black.。
Why?。
Why?。
Why is Ms. Rebecca wearing all black?。
We'll find out in today's story.。
But first things first.。
Let's talk about the last episode.。
Let's repeat.。
We talked a lot about crowns in the last episode, right?。
Did you make a crown?。
Is it full of gold and jewelry?。
It's shining.。
But our Savior Jesus decided to wear what crown?。
Yes, it's very painful and tight.。
It's like a new crown.。
It's all thorns.。
Thorns poking at his forehead.。
It's bleeding.。
He's even holding his own cross.。
What does the sign say?。
King of Jews.。
He's being mocked.。
He's being nailed to the cross.。
That's what we're going to talk about in today's episode.。
What happens after being nailed to the cross?。
Can you guess why Ms. Rebecca is wearing all black?。
You can't or you don't know?。
It's okay.。
Ms. Rebecca will smile after the Bible story.。
Or you'll know in the middle of the story.。
But before we talk about Bible study,。
we're going to play a game.。
What's the game?。
Ms. Rebecca will pretend to be a game.。
You have to guess.。
Get ready.。
Game time.。
Activity time.。
It's game time.。
Ms. Rebecca will focus on feelings today.。
You have to guess what Ms. Rebecca is feeling.。
I'm going to cover my face.。
You can guess.。
We're used to wearing masks.。
You can tell by the mask.。
If you cover your face,。
you can tell by the eyes.。
Let's get started.。
Ready?。
What are you feeling?。
Yes.。
Angry.。
What are you feeling?。
Yes.。
Ready?。
Number two.。
That was a practice.。
Ready?。
Number two.。
What is it?。
Confused.。
Next one.。
Just with my eyes?。
Ready?。
Next one.。
Confused.。
Confused.。
Ready?。
Next one.。
What is it?。
Sneaky.。
Feeling sneaky.。
Next one.。
Can you guess?。
Yes.。
Sad.。
What is it?。
Disgusting.。
That's gross.。
Did you get it?。
Happy.。
Mr. Becker is happy.。
I hope you can learn facial communication.。
You can express yourself by talking.。
Your face, body language, and attitude can tell a lot.。
Today we will focus on feelings.。
Let's see what Mr. Becker is wearing.。
What do you want to express?。
Happy.。
Sad.。
Angry.。
Surprised.。
I want to wear black.。
Story time.。
Get ready.。
Story time.。
Hello everyone.。
It's Bible story time.。
Where did we leave off last time?。
We left off in the middle of two statues.。
I want you to notice where the sun is.。
Yes, it's here.。
Where did we start?。
Last supper.。
We prayed in the garden.。
Jesus was caught.。
Peter denied him three times.。
The rooster crowed.。
It was sunrise.。
After doing so many things, he was nailed to the cross.。
Mourning.。
Do you know when Jesus died?。
When did he die?。
Between 12 and 3pm.。
The sky was dark.。
12pm is usually lunch time.。
Lunch time is high noon.。
Why?。
Because the sun was so high.。
It was very hot.。
Why was the sky like this?。
It was dark.。
What does it mean?。
Jesus died in the middle of nowhere.。
Huge deal.。
Jesus will die.。
The time of waiting was also in the middle of nowhere.。
The whole world knew.。
Of course, this is God's plan.。
Of course they knew.。
But there were many other things.。
Who was there when Jesus was nailed to the cross?。
John, John, Mary, and other friends.。
There were also soldiers.。
Those who helped the government.。
Those who watched him and made sure he died.。
There were two criminals.。
They knew Jesus was innocent.。
They knew Jesus was God's son.。
He was innocent.。
Remember me in heaven.。
Jesus said to John,。
"Because you have accepted me,。
I will give you a place in heaven."。
This means,。
"Hey, this criminal knows.。
Can't other people see it?。
Don't other people know?"。
I don't know.。
And one other thing happened too.。
Jesus asked God,。
"Have you forsaken me?"。
"Do you really want me to die like this?。
Do you really want me to suffer like this?"。
"Yes, I do."。
But do you remember how Jesus prayed in heaven?。
"If you don't need this plan,。
if you don't need me to die,。
if you don't need me to suffer,。
please take this cup away."。
But this plan must be fulfilled.。
Jesus has to die.。
Before he died, he had a throat.。
Under the cross,。
there was a soldier who brought vinegar.。
Who drank the vinegar?。
It was very sour.。
He gave it to him.。
After he drank it, he said,。
"God, forgive them.。
They don't know what they are doing."。
He didn't know what he was doing.。
Okay.。
Jesus suffered so much.。
Before he died, he called God,。
and put a cross on himself.。
Wow, what a big heart, right?。
Super big.。
And then later,。
Jesus breathed his last breath.。
And he died.。
And then more happened.。
You know what happened?。
The whole earth was shaking.。
A huge earthquake.。
Do you know what happened next?。
A Jewish man had a huge temple.。
He had a curtain there.。
He tore it apart.。
Wow, not only the earthquake,。
the curtain was also torn.。
And those who died for God。
started to come back to life.。
They started to come out of their graves.。
Wow.。
What do you think people who see this will do?。
What is good?。
Surprise, right?。
That's a feeling.。
Wow.。
They were surprised.。
They would say, "This is really the Son of God."。
"He is not an ordinary person."。
"This Jesus is definitely very special."。
"He must be the Son of God."。
"Look what's happening."。
But there are other feelings.。
Are there other feelings?。
Marley, John, so many friends are down there.。
Jesus died.。
The cross on the cross is dead.。
The sky is dark.。
They feel so sad.。
You see these two people.。
These two men next to him.。
They are wearing black.。
One is called Joseph.。
A very rich Jew.。
He is also a council member.。
He is also a leader.。
The other is Nicodemus.。
He is a leader.。
In the previous story,。
Nicodemus sneaked out to find Jesus.。
Because he believes Jesus is the Son of God.。
He believes Jesus is the Son of God.。
Nicodemus even called Jesus a teacher.。
They asked,。
"Can you give us Jesus' body?"。
"We will bury him."。
They buried him in the Jewish way.。
But the Jewish way requires a lot of oil and money.。
Without this rich man, Joseph,。
they would not be able to do it.。
Many of the Marley are there.。
Lots of Marys.。
Mary of Magdalene.。
Mary, Jesus' mother.。
And other women who love Jesus.。
They helped to find Jesus.。
They found a tomb back here.。
Back here.。
In the past, rich people dug a hole.。
They said, "After I die, I will be buried there."。
They found a person who had not been buried yet.。
They said, "We will put Jesus in there."。
Look at their faces.。
Do they want to cry?。
They put Jesus in there.。
They put a stone in front of him.。
They said, "Don't use the paper to steal his body."。
"We will show you that he will not come out."。
"He will die."。
This stone is very heavy.。
It covers the entrance and the exit.。
I can go in.。
Because this tomb is like a cave.。
There is no door behind.。
There is only one door.。
This door is covered by a stone.。
Think about it.。
How did they feel?。
How did the 12 disciples feel?。
John, Peter, and all the others.。
They were with Jesus.。
But now they are waiting.。
But do you think the disciples remember。
Jesus once told them,。
"I will die.。
It doesn't matter.。
I will be resurrected in a few days."。
This is God's plan.。
God has said this many times.。
But I don't know if the disciples and Jesus' friends。
remember that moment.。
Because a lot of things happened.。
How did they feel?。
Confused.。
Everything was very confusing.。
There was a lot of mixture of emotions.。
Right?。
This story is about Good Friday.。
This is the day Jesus died.。
It was a dark and gloomy Friday.。
It was sad.。
It was gloomy.。
It was gloomy.。
I don't know what happened.。
I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
But I don't know what I could do.。
In three days, what will happen?。
He rises.。
That's what makes it good.。
It's good for you.。
And it's good for me.。
It's good for everybody.。
Jesus' death is good for everyone.。
Because his death is good for everyone.。
Because his death is good for everyone.。
Because his death is good for everyone.。
Because his death is good for everyone.。
Do you know why Mr. Buckethead。
is wearing a full body suit?。
Why is he wearing a full body suit?。
Why is he wearing a full body suit?。
Because we usually celebrate。
Good Friday.。
We celebrate Jesus' death.。
We celebrate Jesus' death.。
In many cultures,。
people wear dark or dark suits。
to funerals.。
People wear all black or all dark.。
People wear all black or all dark.。
Because dark or dark suits。
often represent what?。
Which feeling?。
This feeling?。
Or。
this feeling?。
Yes.。
Sadness.。
We cry and be sad。
for the lost person,。
the dead person,。
the lost Jesus,。
the dead Jesus.。
There is one point。
I want to mention to everyone.。
Jesus' death。
Jesus' death。
is a huge deal.。
is a huge deal.。
Not just because。
other people are watching.。
Mary,。
Jesus' earthly mother,。
watching her son。
being crucified.。
Jesus called John,。
John, remember to take care of my mother.。
John, remember to take care of my mother.。
Those feelings.。
What's the good of having a son?。
Maybe confused?。
What happened?。
Jesus is God's son.。
Why did this happen?。
Why did he die?。
Mary was very sad.。
Mary was very sad.。
So sad.。
Or some people were happy.。
Yes!。
Getting rid of Jesus, crucify him.。
Yes!。
Some people。
were angry.。
What?。
What?。
Crucify Jesus?。
Or the two sinners。
next to him。
would think,。
I know I made a mistake.。
Jesus is not wrong.。
I know I made a mistake.。
Jesus is not wrong.。
What?。
What?。
What?。
There are many different feelings.。
Many different feelings.。
Right?。
But Heaven。
also has feelings.。
Remember?。
Boom! Boom! Boom!。
Heaven is dark.。
There is one more thing.。
In the Great Hall,。
the Great Holy Temple,。
there is a bowl,。
a curtain,。
like this.。
A thick curtain.。
It is removed.。
Do you know what this curtain。
was used for?。
In the past,。
the Great Holy Temple。
had a curtain。
to block out。
who could approach God。
and who could not.。
Can you go behind the curtain?。
It means you can go.。
It means you are。
being excluded from the Great Hall.。
Not everyone。
can go.。
So,。
in the story,。
it is said that the curtain was removed.。
It means。
it no longer blocks you。
from going in.。
Let's try. How hard is it to remove the curtain?。
Here is a piece of paper.。
Remove.。
Super easy, right?。
You can keep removing it.。
You can remove。
both layers.。
Here is a piece of paper.。
Remove.。
You can't remove it.。
I can't remove it with this much strength.。
Try to remove it.。
You can't cut it.。
The story does not say。
you have to cut the paper.。
It is the curtain itself that is torn.。
What does it mean?。
The curtain separates。
God from others.。
Not the select few.。
Not the chosen few.。
Yes.。
That's right.。
What does it mean?。
Jesus' death。
is for everyone.。
Now, everyone。
can accept Jesus and approach Him.。
No longer a barrier.。
Barrier no more.。
No more blocking.。
Wow.。
Huge deal.。
But also sad.。
Right?。
Sigh.。
Especially。
Jesus' good friend.。
When a good friend。
is gone,。
when a good friend dies,。
of course you will be sad.。
So Good Friday。
is the cost。
of salvation.。
Wow.。
The cost of。
washing away my sins.。
Tear this cloth away.。
That cloth.。
It is worth it.。
But the question is。
does Jesus die worth it?。
This is God's plan.。
Of course。
He thinks it is worth it.。
That,。
my friends,。
is a lot of love.。
It is worth it.。
It is worth the sacrifice.。
But you know what?。
Jesus has said it will happen.。
He also said。
He will be resurrected.。
But sometimes。
we may not remember。
or be clear.。
Many disciples。
may be very confused.。
What is going on?。
But you and I。
because it is this side of the story。
we can know。
what will happen.。
Next time。
continue the story.。
Chinese time!。
OK.。
When I was in the game。
I said。
many different sounds。
or feelings.。
Phew.。
In English。
we may not know many feelings.。
Happy。
and sad.。
But happy and sad。
there are many。
feelings in the middle.。
I will teach you a few.。
OK.。
So next time。
how are you doing?。
I am fine. I am happy. I am sad.。
But there are many。
feelings in the middle.。
Next time。
when someone asks you in Chinese。
how are you?。
You can answer many different things.。
Happy。
and sad.。
You know what?。
Often。
my kids will say。
not happy or sad。
but a little annoyed.。
Bothered.。
Irritated.。
That's one.。
Annoyed.。
Another one。
which sounds like。
a。
food.。
Like vinegar.。
Have you ever had vinegar?。
Have you ever had vinegar?。
Sour.。
A little sour.。
Black vinegar is sour. White vinegar is sour.。
Anyway, it's sour.。
If your feeling。
is sour。
you feel sour.。
You would make that face.。
Very sour.。
Why?。
Irritable.。
Very irritable.。
Usually。
if I feel。
very annoyed。
and then maybe。
I am irritable。
people would say。
Mr. Becker, you are very annoying.。
Annoyed.。
Annoyed.。
You know what that is put together?。
Annoyed.。
The stresses。
of life. Stress.。
Wow.。
Chinese, so efficient.。
Just a syllable.。
Just a syllable.。
Irritated.。
Bothered.。
Irritated.。
Bothered.。
Irritable.。
Irritable.。
Irritable.。
Sour.。
Sour.。
Stressed.。
Stress.。
So much meaning.。
So rich.。
Learn your Chinese.。
Bye.。
Hello, everyone.。
Hello, everyone.。
At home extension time.。
We talked about a lot of different feelings in this story.。
Right?。
Why am I wearing black?。
For basically Good Friday.。
Basically, it's Jesus' funeral.。
Right?。
Or maybe you went to a funeral。
and wore black or。
white.。
Depends on the culture.。
Depends on the funeral.。
How can you extend this learning at home?。
Why does color matter?。
Color can express。
the feeling.。
Right?。
We talked about a lot of different feelings today.。
Let's think about。
different paintings.。
Art.。
Painting.。
What does red。
mean?。
Maybe danger.。
You can ask your child,。
"What is red?"。
Look around.。
"What is red?"。
Stop sign.。
Red light. Right?。
Caution.。
Feeling.。
See the color?。
Next color.。
Maybe something is yellow.。
That's pretty。
uplifting. Happy.。
Why?。
Let's see what is。
naturally yellow.。
Sunshine.。
Yellow sunshine.。
Right?。
We can talk about these things.。
Blue is a。
cooler color.。
A cooler color.。
Not a warm color.。
What feeling?。
Maybe peaceful.。
Maybe calm.。
Or a calm feeling.。
You can ask your child.。
Ask your child。
and connect。
why Mr. Rebecca wore black today.。
Why did he wear。
this color at the funeral?。
What is the connection。
between color and feeling?。
Rainbow color.。
There are many colors.。
But look again.。
What does grey。
mean?。
What does grey mean?。
It's more somber.。
Right?。
What does black。
mean?。
What does black mean?。
It's more mysterious.。
Or。
it's more scary.。
Or sad.。
So,。
when you can use these colors。
to help your child。
to express。
their feelings,。
the attachment。
to the Bible story。
will be deeper.。
But the ability to express。
will be stronger.。
We have another。
at-home extension.。
Draw what you hear.。
We talked about different。
feelings today.。
Different facial expressions.。
Different looks.。
Different colors.。
How to connect colors and feelings.。
Like I wore black.。
It means sadness。
or sadness.。
Using colors and feelings。
to tell a story.。
This Bible story。
is for children to draw.。
Draw what you hear.。
There are many ways to do it.。
Children can use any colored pen。
to draw.。
But when they are drawing,。
they are drawing to listen.。
Either to the story told by parents。
or to the story read in the Bible.。
Jesus dies and was buried.。
Or they can rewind。
to the story I told.。
They can listen,。
not watch.。
Listen, listen, draw.。
I will show you.。
I don't have to do the whole story.。
But you will get the picture.。
You can give them。
many different words.。
There are many different scenes.。
You will have a story。
maybe 3, 4, 5 versions.。
You can write。
the writing。
and text together.。
You will have your own story.。
Just one way.。
I will use this crayon effect.。
I will say。
Oh, you need to use yellow.。
Because。
when Jesus was nailed to the cross,。
what is it?。
It is mourning.。
The cross of Jesus.。
The cross of Jesus.。
There is also。
a time.。
But when Jesus was nailed to the cross,。
the time passed.。
It was 12 o'clock.。
High noon.。
The time passed.。
It became。
3 o'clock.。
But what happened。
at 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock?。
Wow, it was a big deal.。
The whole sky。
was black.。
It was black.。
It was black.。
Black.。
Why?。
Because Jesus was nailed to the cross。
to die.。
It was a big deal.。
That's why.。
Not only was it black.。
It was bright and black.。
But。
Wow, it was。
an earthquake.。
During this time,。
children can draw。
and make a paper earthquake.。
They can also。
shake the paper.。
Or crumble the paper.。
If there is a next scene,。
they can use the second paper.。
Right?。
Let them draw。
until。
they can't draw anymore.。
The story is over.。
You have your story.。
You can continue.。
You can also repeat。
the previous episodes.。
Or the next episodes.。
You can have。
your own story.。
You can write and draw.。
Your own story.。
Self-written, self-illustrated.。
Okay? Give it a try.。
