On this Christmas Sunday, I'm sure if you reveal what has happened to you this year,。
it's going to be probably a very busy day for you, very busy year for you.。
[Chinese]。
Perhaps this year has been a very, very tough year for you.。
[Cantonese]。
For many of us at UV, it has been a challenging year.。
You know, we have families dealing with sickness, dealing with death and crisis and difficulties,。
and our ministries are also tackling with different challenges, and in general,。
I think there are so many stresses in our life.。
[Cantonese]。
So I pray that the songs that we offer to you, the song that we are going to sing,。
the Christmas songs, the baptism testimony, the candle lighting ceremony that we're going to do。
later, will all remind you the real meaning of Christmas.。
[Cantonese]。
Let me read this passage on screen.。
It is taken from the Bible, the Gospel of Luke, from chapter 2.。
[Cantonese]。
Here, the angelic choir is announcing the good news, the good news of the birth of our Savior,。
to the shepherds in the field in Bethlehem, the very good news of the birth of our Savior,。
Jesus Christ.。
[Cantonese]。
Suddenly, the angel was joined by the vast host of other angels, the armies of heaven.。
They praised God and they say, "Glory to God in highest heaven,。
peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased."。
[Cantonese]。
Now, one of the Christmas traditions many Americans would do is to watch some movie,。
some Christmas movie.。
[Cantonese]。
And I don't know if you do that or not.。
[Cantonese]。
But, you know, many of the families, American families, will be watching。
Charlie Brown Christmas this season.。
[Cantonese]。
How many of you have watched this before?。
Charlie Brown Christmas?。
Raise your hand.。
Only a handful, okay?。
Only a handful.。
[Cantonese]。
All right, so in this movie, Charlie Brown, the main character,。
is doing his best to organize a Christmas play with the kids.。
[Cantonese]。
But as you can tell, Charlie Brown is trying to organize this play with other kids and。
kids are not listening to you, right?。
They run around and no one in the story is listening to Charlie Brown.。
And everyone starts to criticize Charlie Brown for his, you know,。
lack of organization or lack of leadership.。
So Charlie was very frustrated and nobody understands the real meaning of Christmas.。
So at the end, Charlie Brown almost gave up.。
[Cantonese]。
And by the way, we have some kids joining us today, which is great, right?。
This is great.。
They're noisy, they're running around, they're joyful and they want to express themselves.。
So as the story goes, Charlie Brown was very frustrated.。
[Cantonese]。
However, at the end, as the story goes, with all the chaos with the kids,。
Charlie Brown has a very wise friend called Ninus.。
So Ninus steps in and Ninus has always been a timid, shy, and, you know,。
less than confident character, less than confident kid in the story.。
[Cantonese]。
And that's why you, whenever you see Ninus in Charlie Brown stories or movies,。
Ninus has always has a security blanket in his hand.。
Okay, ring the bell, remind of this character, always has a security blanket in his hand.。
But, Ninus volunteered himself to tell the story of the Bible and the true meaning of Christmas。
under the spotlight.。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
Do you want to watch this movie?。
[Cantonese]。
Okay, I'll let you watch two minutes.。
[Cantonese]。
Okay, so we're going to watch two minutes of the most, most spectacular moment in this entire movie.。
[Cantonese]。
What about Charlie Brown?。
Do you enjoy the movie?。
Two minutes.。
[Cantonese]。
Now, I want to tell you guys, there's one little detail, one little detail in this clip,。
most of the people missed.。
[Cantonese]。
And that one little detail is that right in the middle of Ninus telling the story of Christmas。
from the Bible, telling other people the real meaning of Christmas, a child is born.。
You see, Ninus actually dropped his security blanket.。
[Cantonese]。
Now, I'm sure we all have our security blankets.。
[Cantonese]。
Things that give you peace, things that give you security, things that give you confidence.。
[Cantonese]。
Maybe our bank account, the money that we have, our friends, our career, our identity,。
or some sort of certainty in our future.。
[Cantonese]。
And we all try to grab that thing, you know, or some things that will give us everlasting peace,。
to give us a little bit more peace, a little bit more, you know, confidence.。
But as you know, in reality, those things do not last.。
They often disappoint us.。
[Cantonese]。
Maybe health, maybe our well-being, maybe our future, our security, whatever that is,。
your security blanket.。
[Cantonese]。
And I want to tell you, you know, they often disappoint us.。
Nothing can be guaranteed.。
[Cantonese]。
Now, what Christmas is all about is a different kind of peace.。
It's a different kind of peace.。
It's a true, everlasting peace.。
It's peace with God our Father.。
[Cantonese]。
Peace in times of chaos, peace in times of difficulty, peace in times of challenge,。
knowing that God is with us.。
God is always with us in Jesus Christ.。
[Cantonese]。
And that is the everlasting peace.。
[Cantonese]。
The real meaning of Christmas.。
Glory to God in the highest heaven and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.。
[Cantonese]。
And the people that God is pleased with are those who have put their faith in Christ Jesus.。
[Cantonese]。
So how can we receive the gift of God in Christ Jesus?。
[Cantonese]。
Well, first thing we have to do is to let go.。
If you want to receive a gift, you have to receive it with open hands.。
But if we are holding on to our security blankets, our stuff, you know, our hands are not open。
and our hearts are not open, then we cannot receive the gift of God.。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
So how can you receive the gift of God?。
Only by your hands not holding on to your security blankets.。
[Cantonese]。
How can we experience the gift of God if our hearts are filled with overwhelm。
with our stuff and our idols, our work, our overwhelmingly busy schedule?。
We etch out God in our life.。
The only way we can receive the gift of God is that we let go of this stuff.。
And with an open heart, we come to God and say, "Thank you for giving me the very son of yours."。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
So at the end, I want to invite you, all of you, to take this moment,。
take this very moment to reconnect, to reconnect with God.。
God who created you, God who loves you, God who is always with you.。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
Now let me read this prayer first before we recite it together.。
So I want to invite you to recite it with, you know, with your words or with your heart.。
[Cantonese]。
Dear Lord Jesus, the prayer says,。
I ask you to grant me peace.。
Peace in my heart when I feel, when it feels like the world all around us spins out of control.。
Help me stay focused on you.。
The son of God, born in a humble manger.。
I come to you, God, with an open heart.。
I know my need for your grace and your forgiveness.。
I ask you to be my savior and my Lord.。
Cleanse me from my sins and make me new today.。
Fill me with your peace and guide me in your way.。
In Jesus' name.。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
Let's end today's service with the lighting ceremony.。
We're going to pass the flame to the candles.。
But we want to end and conclude with this prayer.。
Well, let's do it in English first.。
If you want to join me, go ahead, all right?。
But you can pray in your heart as well.。
Let's do that.。
Dear Lord Jesus, I ask you to grant me peace.。
Peace in my heart when it feels like the world all around us spins out of control.。
Help me stay focused on you.。
The son of God, born in a humble manger.。
I come to you with a humble heart.。
I know my need for your grace and forgiveness.。
I ask you to be my savior and Lord.。
Cleanse me from my sins and make me new.。
Fill me with your peace.。
Guide me in your way.。
In Jesus' name.。
Amen.。
[Cantonese]。
[Cantonese]。
Let's all pray together.。
[Cantonese]。
Lord Jesus, this is our prayer.。
And our prayer is to make room for you.。
[Cantonese]。
And we invite Jesus to come into our lives to be our savior anew.。
To be our Lord.。
So cleanse us and renew us and guide us in your way.。
In Jesus' name.。
[Cantonese]。
Amen.。
