Hello everyone, I'm Miss Rebecca.。
Welcome to Family Sunday School.。
This is the fourth episode.。
What did we talk about last time?。
Remember?。
We talked about Jesus being arrested.。
A very important distinction,。
a very important difference is。
being tied up and dragged away.。
Or what?。
Jesus allowed them to drag him away.。
Do you want to tie him up? No need.。
Do you want to lock him up? No need.。
Do you want to drag him away? No need.。
Jesus just followed them.。
I haven't mentioned this before.。
This is God's plan to save people.。
God said this plan must be fulfilled.。
So Jesus had to obey.。
Jesus knew what was going to happen.。
So he just went with it.。
Remember?。
Last episode, the last Chinese time,。
I gave you a challenge.。
Remember the challenge?。
Because last time we talked about a lot of different things.。
Angles.。
Right?。
Different perspectives, different angles.。
We looked at the story from different angles.。
Judas, John, Peter, Jesus.。
Right?。
Does anyone remember the Chinese challenge?。
Let me remind you.。
We said that "角" can be used as "angle".。
If triangle is "三角形",。
then what is hexagon in Chinese?。
Does anyone know?。
Does anyone remember?。
Have you talked to your family?。
I'll break it down. Ready?。
Triangle. "Tri" means "三",。
"Angle" means "角",。
"三角形" means "three-angle shape".。
How many "角" are there in hexagon?。
One, two, three, four, five, six.。
Right?。
Six.。
"六角形"。
Right?。
Hexagon.。
"Hex" means "six", "hexagon".。
Wow.。
Let's repeat the numbers.。
If I say "octagon",。
you will know, right?。
Let's repeat the numbers.。
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.。
Backwards.。
Countdown.。
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.。
What is "octagon"?。
Let's talk about it in Chinese.。
Hold the thought.。
Okay.。
In this episode, we will continue the story.。
Jesus followed them to be taken away.。
Where did he go?。
What did he do?。
Do you remember who was following them?。
Who was secretly following them?。
Yes.。
John and Peter.。
John and Peter.。
John and Peter.。
Hmm.。
Was it dangerous to follow them?。
Was it dangerous for John and Peter?。
Hmm.。
Where did they take Jesus?。
What happened to Jesus?。
We, as modern Christians,。
know a little bit about it.。
Because we know what "Easter" means.。
But at that moment,。
John and Peter didn't know, right?。
Hmm.。
So today, we will continue the story.。
Before we talk about the story,。
we must play a game, right?。
Mr. Becker loves playing games.。
Okay.。
Let's go.。
The game we are playing this time is called "Name That Animal".。
Guess what animal it is.。
How to guess?。
It's not based on eyes.。
It's based on ears.。
You have to listen to these sounds。
to guess what animal it is.。
Here it comes.。
The first animal.。
Or you can close your eyes.。
Then you can hear these sounds clearly.。
And you can guess what animal it is.。
The first animal.。
Who is it?。
Guess.。
Frog.。
Here comes the next one.。
The hint is,。
"I am large and loud."。
Hmm.。
What is large and loud?。
Let's listen.。
[Name That Animal]。
It's loud.。
Can anyone guess what it is?。
Elephant.。
Elephant.。
Can you hear the different sounds?。
Of course the message is different.。
What it wants to say.。
What it wants to express is different.。
Elephant.。
Here comes the next one.。
The hint is,。
"I am alarming."。
Alarming is like an alarm clock.。
It wakes us up.。
It's loud.。
Alarming.。
Hmm.。
Who has this animal?。
Wake it up.。
Who has heard this sound?。
Wake it up.。
[Name That Animal]。
Anyone knows?。
Guess.。
[Name That Rooster]。
Anyone has this sound?。
Here comes the next one.。
The hint is,。
"I wake up when you go to sleep."。
[Name That Animal]。
Hmm.。
Anyone has this animal?。
[Name That Bird]。
Do you want to hear it again?。
[Name That Bat]。
Hmm.。
Guess.。
Bat.。
[Name That Squeak]。
[Name That Bell]。
Here comes the next one.。
The hint is,。
"I am cleaner than you may think."。
[Name That Bird]。
Let's hear this sound.。
Or,。
"Has anyone been to the farm?"。
You may have heard this sound.。
[Name That Animal]。
Do you know what animal it is?。
We usually think it is dirty,。
but it is actually a very clean animal.。
Let's guess.。
Pig.。
[Name That Pig]。
In the story,。
we may say, "Oink, oink."。
But actually, it sounds like this.。
[Name That Pig]。
Okay.。
The last animal.。
The hint is,。
"I like to talk at night."。
[Name That Animal]。
Let's listen.。
[Name That Animal]。
Okay.。
Let's listen quietly.。
[Name That Bird]。
What is it?。
Have you heard of it?。
Is it familiar?。
It is a cricket.。
[Name That Cricket]。
You heard the sound.。
It is not just one cricket,。
but many crickets.。
Let's talk.。
I want you to think about。
which animal will appear。
in the next story.。
Please pay attention.。
Okay.。
Let's continue the story.。
Peter and John follow Jesus.。
What will happen?。
They will take Jesus away.。
They will find a way to take Jesus away.。
They will find a way to take Jesus away.。
John and Peter must follow Jesus.。
Let's see what will happen.。
Where will they follow Jesus?。
They will go to a big temple.。
In the past, religious leaders。
would gather in a big place.。
There are buildings,。
and a small garden.。
A woman sees him in the garden.。
"Oh, you look so familiar.。
You look like your friends in Jesus' story."。
What will Peter say?。
"We have said that。
Peter will not deny Jesus,。
no matter what."。
"He said so."。
What will Peter say?。
"Yes, what Jesus said will happen,。
will happen."。
Peter said, "No, no, no, not me.。
I don't know him.。
Not me, not me.。
I don't know him."。
They went to another place.。
It was cold outside.。
It was dark.。
They went to a fire to keep warm.。
There was no heater in the past.。
They cooked with fire.。
They kept warm with fire.。
They walked around.。
Another woman came to Peter.。
She asked him,。
"Aren't you the one。
who followed Jesus?"。
"Do you know Jesus?"。
"Hmm,。
what do you think Peter will say?"。
"He denied Jesus last time.。
Will he do it again?"。
"Yes," she said.。
"Not me, not me, not me."。
They walked away.。
They saw many people were drunk.。
They felt safe.。
They went to the main hall.。
They hid and covered themselves.。
No one would notice.。
They just stood there.。
Who would know?。
It was a big deal.。
Among the men,。
one said,。
"Hey,。
aren't you the one。
who cut off the ear?"。
"Yes, it's you.。
You cut off the ear。
of the man。
who cut off the ear.。
You are with Jesus.。
It's you.。
Don't deny it.。
You are with Jesus.。
Hey,。
do you know。
what Peter will say?"。
"Who is it?。
It's not me.。
It's not me."。
"Ah!"。
"Uh-oh!。
What happened?"。
"The cock crowed."。
"Oh!"。
"It was that moment.。
The moment of the cock crowing."。
"Cuckoo!"。
Peter stood up.。
"Oh, Jesus said。
the cock crowed before.。
You will deny me.。
Huh!"。
Three times.。
Did he deny Jesus three times?。
One, the woman.。
Two, the other woman.。
Three, the man who cut off the ear.。
Huh!。
It was that moment again.。
Cuckoo!。
Jesus was inside.。
He was inside the house.。
He looked out of the window.。
He was outside the house.。
Peter heard the cock crow.。
He looked at the window.。
They were good friends.。
They remembered the conversation.。
They looked at each other.。
Jesus was sad.。
What did Peter feel?。
He was sad and guilty.。
Huh!。
What Jesus said would happen,。
we thought it would never happen.。
We thought we were not like that.。
We would not do that.。
But Jesus said it would happen.。
It would happen, right?。
Huh!。
I wonder how Peter feels now.。
I want you to pause and discuss.。
Why did Peter deny Jesus?。
He loved Jesus and followed Jesus.。
Why did people ask him。
if he followed Jesus?。
Did he cut off his ear?。
Did he cut off his head?。
Did he cut off his head?。
No, no, no.。
He obviously lied.。
Why did he do that?。
Huh!。
I know, you know, Peter knows.。
It's not good to lie.。
It's not true, right?。
Telling lies isn't good.。
It's not honest.。
But why did he do that?。
Pause for a moment.。
Think about it.。
Discuss.。
We will come back.。
Okay?。
Let's suppose something.。
We might think,。
Wow! Peter?。
He's so bad.。
He obviously loved Jesus.。
Why did he deny Jesus?。
I will bring you into a story.。
See how you will feel later.。
Or you will change your mind.。
Let's see.。
What if?。
If?。
If?。
You see some kids。
break a window while playing football.。
Oh no!。
The auntie at home。
comes out and scolds them.。
Who broke my window?。
She sees your friend nearby.。
Wow!。
She accuses your friend.。
She brings him back.。
Scolds him.。
And she asks his mom and dad。
to clarify what happened.。
Oh! Big trouble!。
Right?。
But your friend。
has a big question mark.。
Huh?。
What happened?。
Your friend doesn't know what happened.。
But do you know what your friend is doing?。
He is playing football with you.。
But the ball you play with。
and the ball that broke the window。
are different.。
Actually, they are not.。
But why is the auntie。
your friend?。
Hmm...。
How do you feel?。
Wow!。
She sees my friend.。
Huh!。
She scolds him.。
I am so nervous.。
Do you think you will say something?。
If the auntie asks you。
"Hey!。
You play football with him, right?"。
"Of course!"。
"You broke the window."。
"Do you know him?"。
"Do you know that kid?"。
"Do you play football with him?"。
"What should I do?"。
"Do you know what to do?"。
Or maybe you are like Peter。
who doesn't want to say anything。
but you don't know him.。
Actually,。
Peter didn't expect。
to deny Jesus.。
We talked about this in the last supper.。
He said he would never do that。
because he thought。
there was no reason。
or situation。
to deny Jesus.。
But think about it.。
Jesus was just arrested.。
A lot of things happened, right?。
Peter was so nervous。
and scared.。
It's like this story.。
The adults asked him。
"Hey!。
Do you know that kid?"。
"He broke the window."。
"Are you with him?"。
"Oh!"。
Or maybe you would say。
"No, no, I am not with him.。
I don't know him. Bye bye."。
Right?。
It's possible, right?。
So it could have been you too.。
Actually, we could have also been Peter.。
From this perspective,。
it's also a perspective, right?。
Actually, when we put ourselves。
into the Bible story,。
we will understand more。
that these characters。
are not just characters.。
They are real people.。
Real life, real people.。
We can understand。
and empathize.。
We can imagine。
and feel their feelings.。
When we feel empathy,。
we will understand more.。
"Yes, Peter loves Jesus so much.。
Of course, he won't deny it.。
But compared to me,。
I am also scared.。
Why am I being pulled into this?。
Or maybe I won't say it.。
But I feel guilty inside.。
Guilty, right?。
So we can put ourselves。
into the situation。
and feel more of the other person's feelings.。
Sometimes, when we lie,。
we are protecting ourselves, right?。
Who has done it?。
I can be very honest.。
Who has done something。
that we are afraid of getting into trouble。
and being recognized?。
What will happen if we are recognized?。
What will happen if we are not recognized?。
When I was young,。
I used to eat chocolate cake secretly.。
My mom told me not to eat it.。
After the party,。
the guests ate it all.。
I ate the leftovers.。
But that box of cake。
was really delicious.。
But I told my mom,。
I promised not to eat it.。
I won't eat this cake.。
I won't eat a single piece, mom.。
Mom went out.。
I and this box of cake。
are very close, right?。
I opened the box of cake.。
I took a piece of cake from the back.。
I closed the box.。
I closed the box.。
No one would know, right?。
But it's not just once.。
Wait a minute.。
It's me and this box of cake.。
The first piece was delicious.。
I ate the second piece.。
The third piece.。
Mom came back.。
She was going to take the cake out。
and put it on a plate。
for the guests to eat.。
She opened the box of cake.。
She put the cookies in the box.。
She took more.。
I was the third person.。
She took out the first piece of cake。
and put it on the plate.。
She put the second piece of cake on the plate.。
The third piece of cake.。
This is the one I stole.。
She stole the third piece of cake.。
Uh-oh.。
She saw it.。
It was obviously a new one.。
Why didn't she see a few pieces of cake?。
What did she do?。
She walked around.。
She was busy.。
She read books.。
She drew.。
She sat down and slept.。
She did a lot of things.。
Mom asked,。
"Do you know where the cookies are?"。
"I don't know."。
"Why did you do that?"。
"You knew. Why didn't you tell me?"。
She asked again.。
"But you were the only one at home with the cookies."。
"Grandma was in the back garden."。
"Grandma didn't like to eat. Where did the cookies go?"。
"Uh-oh."。
"Oh, no. What now?"。
"I don't know."。
She kept running away.。
She looked for a place.。
She pretended not to know.。
She pretended not to see.。
She asked again.。
"Tell me honestly."。
"Did you eat the cookies?"。
"Oh, no."。
"I was found out."。
"I didn't steal them. I just ate them."。
She said,。
"You know there are a lot of cookies on your clothes, right?"。
"I don't know about my face, but I feel very guilty."。
"I feel so guilty."。
Mom asked,。
"You mean you opened the cookies without thinking,"。
"put your hand in it without thinking,"。
"and took the cookies out without thinking,"。
"put the cookies in your mouth without thinking,"。
"and chewed them without thinking,"。
"and swallowed them without thinking?"。
"Right?"。
"Uh... yes."。
"Isn't this story funny?"。
"It's true."。
"I'm the one who's telling the truth."。
"I ate the cookies without thinking."。
"But..."。
"You asked me, 'Hey, Miss Rebecca, will you tell a lie?'"。
"I said, 'No, no, no, no, no, no.'"。
"I'm a very honest person. I'm very honest."。
"But..."。
"Sigh..."。
"When I feel in trouble,"。
"when I feel dangerous,"。
"I might do it."。
"Right?"。
"Everyone does it, right?"。
"Have you tried it?"。
"You can be honest."。
"You can pause and talk."。
"You can be honest."。
"Why?"。
"Because God forgave us."。
"We forgive others."。
"Right?"。
"God knows our hearts."。
"God knows that when I was a kid,"。
"I couldn't resist this delicious chocolate cake."。
"It was so delicious."。
"I didn't have junk food at home."。
"A customer said, 'Wow, your chocolate chip cookie!'"。
"I couldn't resist it. I ate it."。
"He understood."。
"I regretted it later."。
"I told my mom, 'Sorry.'"。
"Not only did I eat the cake, right?"。
"I'm sorry."。
"Not only did I eat it, I also lied."。
"But after I told her, I felt much better."。
"Do you think..."。
"Jesus knows."。
"I think my mom knows, too."。
"I'm wearing a cake dress."。
"She knows I did it."。
"But she gave me a chance."。
"Do you think Jesus can give you a chance?"。
"Let's talk next time."。
Chinese time.。
What is our special animal today?。
There are many animals in our show.。
Is it a pig?。
A elephant?。
No?。
Hmm...。
A bat.。
What is our special animal today?。
A bat?。
No, of course not.。
It's a rooster.。
Now,。
"公雞" is "rooster" in English.。
"母雞" is "hen" in Chinese.。
Okay, Chinese time.。
We remember that English has different names,。
male and female.。
Right?。
But in Chinese,。
we often add "公"。
or "母"。
or "那".。
That's it.。
Like "牛", "cow".。
"母牛"。
"母牛"。
Oh!。
Interesting.。
"母" means "mother".。
So, if you add "母" to "母"。
it becomes a female animal.。
Wow!。
Then you don't have to remember so many things.。
Right?。
I know that。
people often ask。
"Is your dog male or female?"。
"公" means "male".。
Right.。
"那" means "female".。
Oh!。
Also,。
in the beginning of the Chinese time,。
there was a challenge.。
In the beginning of the intro,。
I said that there was a challenge in Chinese time.。
"Octagon"。
What is it in Chinese?。
What is a triangle?。
Right.。
What is a hexagon?。
What is an octagon?。
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.。
Octopus。
"八爪魚"。
What is an octagon?。
Right. Octagon.。
You got it!。
OK. Let's go back to practice.。
See what other animals can add "公"。
and "母".。
See you next time!。
Bye!。
Hello everyone!。
I have taken out my Bible.。
Here.。
There is a Bible.。
We are very familiar with the Bible。
of our children.。
This is the Bible.。
Right?。
This one.。
This one.。
It is in cartoon style.。
It is for children.。
A common theme in this Bible is that。
the picture is usually very big.。
The words are smaller.。
The story is more like one, two, three pages.。
Usually,。
like this one。
and this one,。
each story is separate.。
Especially,。
like you said,。
when Daniel and the lions。
jump to the next story.。
There are not many stories connected.。
It is like a big story.。
But actually,。
the Bible is a big story.。
The Old Testament and the New Testament are together.。
This Bible story,。
Jesus Storybook Bible,。
is connected to a theme.。
Each story of the Old Testament。
and the New Testament。
points to Jesus Christ.。
So,。
this is the major difference.。
But the style is similar.。
I want to talk to you about。
the Bible of children.。
There are many kinds.。
But what do we want to pay attention to?。
We want to pay attention to the illustration.。
The text, the words,。
the vocabulary.。
How difficult is the word "born"?。
Do children read it by themselves?。
Or do adults read it?。
We can also look at the storytelling.。
How deep is it?。
Are there details?。
We know that there are.。
This kind of Bible,。
and our adult Bible,。
adults' Bible has more details.。
But there are also。
other Bible for children。
that have more details.。
For example,。
this series.。
Each story is drawn out of a book.。
The Last Stepper.。
The Last Stepper.。
Alone.。
There are more than 20 pages.。
So the story is more substantial.。
They will think that。
the story is really long.。
So,。
if you add them up,。
it becomes a series.。
Then,。
why。
if there are so many exposures,。
children will know that there are many different perspectives.。
Right?。
They will appreciate it more.。
You can also see that。
this illustration is different from other illustrations.。
The second kind is this one.。
It's about facts.。
This is graphic, infographic.。
This is also like an encyclopedia.。
Right?。
You can see that the illustrations。
are more realistic.。
Right?。
It really looks like a real person's handwriting.。
Right?。
The Bible says that。
there is a river,。
and there is a hill,。
and there is a hill,。
so there are many things happening.。
You will know that it really happened.。
Wow!。
So many things,。
plus the children,。
make the Bible stories more profound.。
They know that。
just like adults,。
if you continue to study the Bible,。
more exciting things will happen.。
So we give them more exposure to。
not just the stories,。
but also the perspectives。
of the stories, the telling,。
and the art.。
They will know that there are so many。
ways to express。
our knowledge of Jesus,。
our knowledge of God.。
It can be abstract,。
abstract,。
or realistic.。
It can be like a real person's handwriting.。
There is also a type of Bible。
that looks like a comic book.。
We see a lot of words in adult Bibles.。
We imagine what we see.。
We imagine what we see.。
We have seen。
painters who draw Jesus,。
or paint with oil paint.。
painters who draw Jesus,。
or paint with oil paint.。
But there is more than just this representation.。
But there is more than just this representation.。
You can use comic books。
to represent Jesus.。
The difference is that。
you need to know that。
some things are taken for granted.。
You may not know if Jesus really said。
these words.。
But the reference is in the Holy Bible.。
But the reference is in the Holy Bible.。
There is also this type of Bible.。
This is actually quite old.。
This is also a comic book.。
Look at this.。
The picture is more realistic.。
You can see every expression.。
As the story goes along,。
the expression will be different.。
Why is this important?。
Because in so many Bibles,。
the children's understanding of the Bible。
is deeper because。
there are different perspectives.。
There is a geographic perspective.。
There is a geographic perspective.。
It's like this book.。
There is an emotional perspective.。
You can see the emotional and。
psychological aspects of the Bible.。
You can see the emotional aspects of the Bible.。
You can feel the emotional aspects of the Bible.。
Or you may like data.。
Or you may like data.。
Factual perspective.。
Historical perspective.。
There are also many different。
perspectives and。
different perspectives.。
The more you think and。
know, the deeper the understanding.。
There is a connection.。
I have talked about many different。
Bibles. Children's Bible.。
I want you to。
refer to。
the version I talked about。
and。
the version in your。
children's Bible.。
What is included?。
Look for the part。
of Rooster.。
Look for the part of。
Peter denying Jesus.。
Look at。
which Bible has some things。
which Bible has some things。
and look at the illustrations.。
and look at the illustrations.。
So,。
we talked about perspective in the last episode.。
This time,。
there is more exposure.。
Actually,。
children know this story。
more deeply.。
The more connection,。
the better.。
The more connection,。
the deeper the understanding.。
The more connection,。
the better.。
Story.。
Look at different stories,。
different Bibles, different illustrations.。
Connecting.。
Connecting your。
personal story.。
Right?。
Have you ever lied?。
Have you ever denied someone?。
Yes, you have.。
The connection。
between Peter and you。
is deeper.。
OK.。
Challenge yourself to do this.。
Also, if your children。
like animals,。
also like animals,。
you can play the game.。
Go to the Internet。
and look for sound effects。
or animal sounds.。
Play with your children.。
Guess which animal it is.。
Alright.。
See you next time.。
