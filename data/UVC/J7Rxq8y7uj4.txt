(speaking in foreign language)。
- Good morning, church.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
- How do you like the new setting and new arrangement?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
- Well, let's give a hand to the worship team。
and thank you for leading us.。
And especially the backstage people,。
those people who are hiding back there,。
they're doing a lot of work, okay?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, I can speak a little bit, man,。
not for too long, okay?。
And then especially (speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, okay.。
So we hope and pray that this is a new beginning。
for our church, especially this service.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And as you know, it's a beginning for our church。
and today we are trying to have this bilingual service.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And we announced it last Sunday.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And I wanna again thank all the staff。
and all the people who serve.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
As you know, the church is never a one man band.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And it's a family.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
It takes every single one of us to work together,。
to grow together.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
As you know, nine years ago,。
when we launched our church in this small warehouse.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And how many people we had?。
We had about, what, 30 to 40 people?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And today, by the grace of God,。
and we have grown into a 100 plus adult community.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And this year, we wanna challenge you。
with this theme, crossover.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
As you can see, break our barriers and our boundaries。
and join together to build up the church.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And to reach out to new people.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So that we and each and every one of us。
will be touched by the love of God.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, as we begin, I wanna ask one question.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
What kind of church God want us to become?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, same in this question,。
what kind of church God want us to become?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
You see, we have been studying the book of Acts.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And it's a book filled with wonderful stories.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
It's a book filled with inspiring pictures。
of the first church, the first people of God.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
It's kind of like you take your iPhone。
and you go back, you time travel,。
go back to the first century。
and try to take selfie of the church in Jerusalem.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
You take some selfies of the life of the church back then.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, those picture will tell you they are。
the ideal community.。
And Acts 2 is a good example.。
Let me read this passage.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Let me read that verse by verse and will be translated.。
Verse 42, "They devoted themselves to church in Jerusalem,。
"the first church of God, to the apostles' teaching。
"and to the fellowship and breaking of bread and to prayer."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Everyone was filled with awe and many wonders。
"and miraculous signs were done by the apostles."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"And look, all the believers were together。
"and had everything in common."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"They sell their possessions and goods。
"and they gave to everyone that had need."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"And every day they continued to meet together。
"in temple courts and they broke bread in their homes。
"and ate together with glad and sincere hearts."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"They praise God and enjoy the favor of all the people。
"and the Lord add to the numbers daily。
"those who are being saved."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Now I wanna focus on this verse 42."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"It says they devoted themselves。
"to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"And you can imagine it gives you a picture。
"of Christians working hard and persistently together."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"And see they're dedicated, they're devoted。
"to the teaching of the Bible."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"And they overcome challenges and issues。
"to maintain the fellowship family together."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Now this is called commitment."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"And what does it take to build a church?"。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"It is commitment."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Commitment is not based on your feeling, your emotions,。
"it's based on values."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"It's based on what you keep doing something,。
"even when it doesn't feel excited anymore."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"And today many people see church as gym membership."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Now how many of you have gym membership?"。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Yeah, okay, very good, very good, yeah.。
"We wanna encourage that, but to many people,。
"gym membership is you sign up and you go。
"when you feel like it."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"And then you don't go, you disappear for weeks,。
"and then probably you come back when you feel like it,。
"and then hopefully you get some quick results."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"And nobody sees you, nobody holds you accountable."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"The commitment is not like that."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Commitment is having a training partner."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"It's not just membership, having a partner in training。
"is that you show up even when you are tired."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Because you know somebody's waiting for you."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"And you and the partner will push。
"and challenge each other."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"And you don't easily ghost each other。
"when life gets busy."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"The church is not just membership."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"It's the people you work with."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"You work with them and you continue to build the church."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Now I understand many of us are immigrants or foreigners."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Now let me tell you a story.。
"My family, my family,。
"we came to the United States in 1990."。
That's how many years ago.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"So we came to the United States as immigrants, foreigners,。
"and we came in 1990 and life was really hard。
"and we have to work really, really hard."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"We work all day and we came home。
"and then what we do, we close the door."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"And then the next morning we're up again。
"and we work hard again."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Because life was hard and busy."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"My goodness, we work around the clock."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"We save every penny, we are scavengers,。
"we try to take everything possible for our benefit."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Now this mode of living is like, it's a mode of survival."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Now it's very understandable。
"and there's underlying feeling of fear."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"You see, we foreigners, we immigrants,。
"at least we, my family, we work hard and we stay quiet。
"and we want to protect ourselves."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"We don't trust other people."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"We don't share with other people."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"Because we want to survive because of fear,。
"fear of losing our money, our asset, our security,。
"our place of stay."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"That is our natural mode of survival."。
But for the first church in Jerusalem,。
for the first Christians in Jerusalem,。
life was hard as well.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
They face challenges and even persecutions.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
But surprisingly, they continue to grow。
and they continue to fly and expand.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And now we have to ask why.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
You know, because they were committed.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Commitment says, "I am not just interested, I'm invested."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
"I'm not here just when life is easy,。
"I'm here because it matters."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
See, that's what happens when the Holy Spirit takes over.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And then people, their lives will cross over。
from fear to faith, from surviving to serving.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
No, the entire Bible,。
God did not come to save individual people only.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
The Holy Spirit came and formed a new people.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
A new kind of community.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So here's my challenges for you today.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Be committed.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
The Bible says the church is a family we belong to.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And I've served in different churches for years.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And I've learned one thing,。
my relationship with others in the church is reciprocal.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And the more I love the church,。
the more I serve the church,。
the church, interestingly, will love you back.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
It's reciprocal because we need to grow in the community.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
So today my challenge for you is to create a new schedule.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And the new schedule says commitment.。
It says Sunday worship is not negotiable.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Because you do talk about priority.。
My priority is God.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, you understand Christians are always under spotlight.。
We are always watched by the world.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Whether you like it or not,。
I give you an example of very vivid illustration.。
Just last week, we are all, our social media,。
is all flooded by a video of a couple,。
a cop having an affair in a Coldplay concert, right?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And sometimes, you know, stuff like this,。
you know, I think the most interesting thing。
is the comments.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, one comment says, if they, the couple,。
had not tried to escape the camera。
or, you know, tried to get away from the camera,。
maybe everything would turn out fine, right?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And another reply was very surprisingly and entertaining.。
It says, "You're already here,。
"and what is there to be afraid of?"。
(speaking in foreign language)。
In any case, I mean, you have to understand。
the church question, we questions,。
we are always in the public eyes.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And we need to rely on the grace of God。
to set a good example.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And we questions, we, the church,。
need to be camera-ready all the time,。
and we need to be always ready,。
and that calls for commitment.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And commitment says, "I'm interested, I'm ready, I'm live."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And see, commitment says, "I'm going to worship God。
"and put God as my number one。
"with other believers of Jesus in the community."。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And the second point, on top of being committed,。
is be connected.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Start to connect with other people in the church family.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, you have to do your job,。
you have to take the initiative to get to know each other,。
and then pray for one another.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, on your way in, I think a Jinfan。
already gave you a slip of paper, right?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Have you got it?。
Okay, all right.。
So you write your name in the slip of paper, right?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Did you?。
Okay, if not, we're gonna pass it to you right now.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
All right, how many of you got it?。
Okay, this is something we wanna do together, okay?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, you have your name on the slip of paper.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
All right, and then we're going to mix it up, okay?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
All right, so Jinfan, please,。
you're gonna distribute it to all the people,。
and then when you get this slip of paper,。
write down your name.。
Don't scribble it, okay?。
Write down, you know, capital letters,。
or write clearly your name, okay?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And then we're gonna mix it up.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And then when you pick up a slip of paper。
with someone else's name on it,。
(speaking in foreign language)。
and then you're gonna learn that name.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, and then, in this coming week,。
you're gonna pray for that person every single day.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, should we do it now?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Let's do it now, let's do something together, all right?。
So, there are some pens back there,。
some pencil back there.。
You are free to leave your seat right now,。
and go and get some pencil,。
and write down your name, and give it to Jin--。
Huh?。
- I already did it, I already did it.。
- Some people already did it, okay, good.。
- I did for them.。
- Oh, you did for them, okay.。
- Nice.。
She's going to distribute some of the slips of paper。
to other people.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, so you pick up a slip of paper.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Check the name.。
Make sure the name is not your name, okay?。
You're not gonna pray for yourself, okay?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Make sure the name is not your name, all right?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Then it should go well, all right?。
And then, what do you do?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Learn that name, all right?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Well, learn to pronounce it.。
- Yeah.。
- Learn how to write it. - (speaking in foreign language)。
- Okay, that is the name you wanna keep。
that person accountable in your prayers.。
This week.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, everybody got it?。
Can you, can you raise your hand?。
Oh, okay, I got two.。
- Thank you, thank you, I got it.。
- Yeah, sure, yeah.。
Let me check if this is my name.。
- Yeah.。
- All right, I got a very good name.。
- Yeah.。
- All right, so this is what you do after the service.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
You try to go to that person.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Are you this guy?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
All right, you're gonna ask, okay?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
See, it takes initiative.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, and then say hello.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Say hi.。
All right, in the community, right?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
All right, so you pick up this name,。
you're gonna pray for that person every single day.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Now, you learn that name,。
and then maybe you can strike a conversation。
with the person.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And then you can ask,。
how can I pray for you this week?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay?。
Now, you don't have to dig around for some,。
you know, you don't have to invade privacy, okay?。
Just pray for my work or something like that, okay?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Be polite, okay?。
We're all adults, okay?。
You know, learn that person, I mean, it's gonna be fun.。
- Yeah. - All right?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Okay, so remember what you do?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
I'm gonna remind you after the sermon, okay?。
- Okay.。
- What I'm saying is be committed and be connected.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And we can build the church together,。
we can serve God together.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Shall we?。
Shall we?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Let us pray.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Thank you, Lord Jesus,。
you never held back your love for us.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And you are committed to us to redeem us.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And today we ask in our prayer。
to make us a committed people,。
faithful, devoted, and rooted in you.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And truly give us the courage to serve。
even when it is inconvenient.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And dear God, help us to love even when it's not returned.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
And Jesus teach us to make you our number one priority.。
With our time, our hearts, our gifts, and our whole lives.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Because we are yours.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Help us to live like that.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
In your name we pray.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
Amen.。
- Amen.。
- Amen.。
Okay, so one more reminder.。
You got that?。
Okay, now is a good time, okay?。
I'll give you five minutes, you know,。
you can mix and match and find that person, okay?。
Find it.。
If you don't know, ask about it, okay?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
All right, so you can get up and go around the room。
and learn that person's name, okay?。
(speaking in foreign language)。
All right.。
(audience laughing)。
And by the way, we have some refreshments outside。
and you--。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(audience chattering)。
(speaking in foreign language)。
(gentle music)。
(gentle music continues)。
(gentle music continues)。
(gentle music continues)。
(gentle music continues)。
(upbeat music)。
(upbeat music)。
