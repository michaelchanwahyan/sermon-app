Alright, good morning, Yuyi.。
大家早上好!。
It's good to be with you all again this morning.。
非常感激,今天有機會跟大家一起分享神的信息。。
Okay, so we have been in a series on Jesus' Sermon on the Mount for actually more than。
a year now, going through Jesus' teaching from Matthew 5-7, chapter by chapter, section。
by section.。
And today is a special day because we are finally coming to the concluding portion for。
this entire Sermon on the Mount.。
And this is a very important section because after laying out all His teachings and principles。
for His Kingdom of Heaven, Jesus now demands a response from us.。
我们已经在登山保训的系列信息中学习了一年多。。
从马太福音第五章到第七章,逐章逐段的研读耶稣的教导,今天。
我们终于来到整篇登山保训的结尾部分。。
这是一个非常重要的段落,因为在阐明了天国所有教导和原则。
之后,耶稣现在要求听众做出回应。。
So if you have been with me since the beginning of this series back in July last year, my prayer。
for you is that at the very least, some of what Jesus has taught here have resonated with。
you or make an impact in your personal walk with the Lord.。
如果你从去年七月这个系列开始就一直同我一起学习的话,我为你祷告。。
希望耶稣在这里的教导至少有一些已经触动了你,化在于你与主同行的路上产生了影响。。
So before we dive into our passage today, let's just do a quick review of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.。
And so when Jesus began his ministry, this is the central message that he preached.。
"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near."。
在进入今天的经文之前,让我们快速回顾一下耶稣的登山保训。。
当耶稣开始祂的事工时,祂所传讲的信息是,天国尽了。。
你们应当悔改。。
And so in this first century world, dominated by the Greco-Roman Empire,。
Jesus is actually ushering a new kingdom and a new way of living。
that is radically different from the culture around them.。
And so in his preaching, Jesus announced that the kingdom of heaven has now arrived here on earth.。
And the Sermon on the Mount is actually where we find out what this new way of living。
that Jesus ushers in looked like.。
So if you want to pull out your Bible, you can follow with me along for a little bit.。
In Matthew chapter 5, Jesus begins his sermon by casting a vision of what a true flourishing life。
or what a truly blessed life looks like in this kingdom of heaven in the Beatitudes.。
And so contrary to the culture, a true flourishing life comes from being poor in spirit,。
being humble and meek, and being persecuted because of righteousness.。
And then this true flourishing life should leave a positive impact in the world that we live in。
and point other people to God the Father.。
And this is why Jesus called us to be salt of the earth and light of the world.。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
And then in verse 17, Jesus proclaims that he has come to fulfill the law of God perfectly.。
As the only one that has perfectly fulfilled all of God's law,。
Jesus also established himself as the ultimate interpreter of these laws.。
And he reveals to us the heart of God and the better righteousness behind all these laws.。
And so in verse 20, he called us to live out this better righteousness redefined by him,。
not the religious leaders or the teachers of the law of his days.。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
And from there, in the later half of Matthew 5,。
Jesus show us six case studies of this true and better righteousness。
that will lead to a truly flourishing life.。
Beginning with the issues of anger and lust,。
and then God's design for marriage,。
and then integrity in the way we talk in our speech,。
and then finally to not seeking revenge and responding to our enemy with love.。
This, according to Jesus, should be the norm in his new kingdom of heaven.。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
And in Matthew 6, Jesus continues with his kingdom teaching。
by addressing three of the most common religious activities of his days,。
giving to the poor, praying, and fasting.。
And once again, Jesus redefines what true religion is according to his new kingdom,。
one that is not concerned with the praise of the people,。
but for the approval of the Father alone.。
And in the section on prayer, this is also where we find the Lord's Prayer.。
[speaking Chinese]。
And then beginning in verse 19 in chapter 6,。
Jesus turns his attention to our relationship towards our earthly possessions.。
And so, instead of worshiping our earthly wealth,。
Jesus tells us to invest in heavenly treasure that will last for eternity.。
And when we are able to set our heart on heavenly treasure,。
we don't have to worry about our earthly needs anymore,。
because we know that the God who takes care of the birds in the sky。
and the wildflowers in the field will take care of us as well.。
[speaking Chinese]。
And when we come to chapter 7,。
Jesus continues to lay out the social responsibilities。
of those who are part of his new kingdom,。
especially in the way we treat others.。
And so, in chapter 7, verse 12,。
Jesus gives us this summary statement of our social responsibility towards others。
according to his kingdom ethics.。
And this is what sometimes we call the golden rules.。
So, do to others what you would have them do to you.。
And this is the true and better righteousness that Jesus has shown us.。
And this is also the new way of living that Jesus wants us to follow。
as the citizens of his kingdom of heaven.。
[speaking Chinese]。
And so, in chapter 12,。
Jesus gives us this summary statement of our social responsibility towards others。
according to his kingdom ethics.。
And this is what sometimes we call the golden rules.。
So, do to others what you would have them do to you.。
And this is the true and better righteousness that Jesus has shown us.。
And this is also the new way of living that Jesus wants us to follow as the citizens of his kingdom.。
And so, all of this leads us to our passage today,。
where Jesus presents to all his listeners, including us,。
with an important decision to make.。
And this decision is a binary decision,。
which means that there is an either/or decision.。
There is no room for being on the fence or not making a choice,。
since everyone has to decide for themselves.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So, what are the two options here?。
Let's take a look at our passage today.。
So, this is Matthew 7, verses 13 and 14.。
"Enter through the narrow gate,。
for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction,。
and many enter through it.。
But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life,。
and only a few find it."。
And so, this leads me to my first point today,。
that everyone has to make a conscious decision.。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
Yes, so everyone has to make a conscious decision.。
And so, when I was out on my run earlier last week,。
I saw this exact verse written on the ground around 33rd and Wentworth.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So, it says, "Enter through the narrow," and then it got blurred a little,。
but it's "Enter through the narrow gate."。
So, what is this narrow gate and this narrow path。
that our passage is talking about today?。
So, this narrow path is the way of the kingdom of heaven.。
This way of the kingdom is not the most glamorous or popular one.。
It will be restricting and confining for those who want to enter through it.。
[speaking Chinese]。
And so, again, if you look back at all the kingdom principles and values。
that Jesus has laid out in his sermon on the mount,。
they're all very counter-cultural and demanding in some sense, right?。
For example, to turn the other cheek, to love your enemies,。
and to not gather up material wealth for ourselves, and the list goes on.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So, to choose this narrow path means that it will not be an easy journey。
because there will be trials and challenges along the way.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So, that is the narrow gate and the narrow path on one hand.。
And on the other hand, there is the wide gate and the broad path,。
which I would call the way of this world.。
And this way of the world welcomes all kinds of challenges.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So, the narrow path is the way of the kingdom of heaven.。
And I would call the way of this world.。
And this way of the world welcomes all kinds of beliefs, lifestyles, and values.。
And this is why the broader path is so popular,。
and many people choose to enter through it.。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
And in a world that prioritizes personal freedom,。
this is a very attractive path, right?。
Imagine living in a world where there is no moral absolute,。
and you are just free to do whatever you want to do.。
This might sound like a very compelling way to live initially,。
but I can guarantee you that there will come a point。
when the emptiness and the loneliness in life begins to settle in,。
and you just begin to wonder,。
"Is there more to life than this?"。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
And this is when you realize that the freedom you have。
is actually not producing the kind of fulfilling and happy life。
that you think this freedom can produce.。
[speaking Chinese]。
And this becomes even clearer。
when we take a look at the final destination of these two different paths.。
The only path that will lead to a true and flourishing life。
is not the wide and easy one, but the narrow path.。
And so, yes, while this narrow path is restricting and confining,。
it is the only way that will lead to true freedom.。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
I like how this author and pastor John Mark Comer puts it。
when he described the correlation between the dichotomy。
of the way of life that is restrictive and confined on one hand,。
and the resulting freedom that it brings on the other hand.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So speaking of rule of life,。
or you can think of it simply as a plan to follow Jesus,。
John Mark Comer says,。
"The rule of life is an invitation to a very different definition of freedom。
than that of the modern world,。
an invitation to embrace constraints,。
and that if you give yourself to them, will eventually set you free."。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
So, in the same way, if we're willing to embrace these constraints。
and limitation and restrictions that are being placed upon us。
because we choose to follow Jesus on this narrow path,。
it will ultimately lead to true freedom in Christ.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So, this is the first point that I want to emphasize today,。
that everyone has to make a conscious decision for themselves.。
And Jesus makes his command abundantly clear for us,。
"Enter through the narrow gate."。
[speaking Chinese]。
However, as we have seen,。
this journey through the narrow path will not be an easy one,。
and there will be trials and temptation along the way.。
And because of that, we need to be alert.。
And so this brings me to my second point today,。
that we need to be aware of spiritual deception.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So, let's take a look at verse 15 to 20.。
[speaking Chinese]。
"Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing,。
but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.。
By their fruit you will recognize them.。
Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles?。
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit,。
but a bad tree bears bad fruit.。
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit,。
and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.。
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
So on the way to the narrow path, we have to be alert and vigilant,。
looking out for false prophets or false teachers。
who are trying to lead us away from the path towards life.。
And most of the time, these false teachers,。
they don't just come with a bright neon sign telling you who they are.。
But instead, they usually come in spiritual disguise,。
like wolves in sheep's clothing.。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
And if you pay attention to just the culture around us,。
you can probably easily find all sorts of different narratives。
that promise the kind of true and flourishing life。
that only Jesus can provide.。
And so if we don't do our due diligence in discerning。
all these different narratives that are being thrown at us every day,。
we could easily fall into their traps.。
[speaking Chinese]。
And so because of this, Jesus warned us, "Watch out for false prophets."。
And according to verse 20, the best way that we can discern。
if someone is a true or false prophet。
is not by what they preach or what they teach,。
but it is by the fruit that they produce,。
and whether or not the fruit of the Spirit is evident in their life.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So this is the first type of spiritual deception。
that we need to be aware of, one that comes from other people.。
But Jesus also warns us about the second type of spiritual deception,。
that is our own self-deception.。
[speaking Chinese]。
And so we need to be aware of this.。
So verse 21, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, I am a prophet,'。
is a true prophet."。
[speaking Chinese]。
And so we need to be aware of this.。
[speaking Chinese]。
And so we need to be aware of this.。
Verse 21, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,'。
will enter into the kingdom of heaven,。
but only those who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.。
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord,。
did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons,。
and in your name perform many miracles?'。
Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you.。
Away from me, you evil doers.'"。
[speaking Chinese]。
And so the keywords here are the word "says" and "do" in verse 21.。
And so following Jesus is not just about saying it。
or confessing it with our mouth,。
but our action have to reflect what we confess and believe.。
[speaking Chinese]。
The book of James talks about that faith without work is dead.。
So if your faith in Jesus does not make you love God more。
and want to make Him the absolute priority of your life,。
your faith might be dead.。
And if your faith in Jesus does not make you become a more loving person。
towards your family, your coworkers, or your neighbors,。
again, your faith might be dead as well.。
[speaking Chinese]。
And the fact that someone can prophesize, drive out demons,。
and perform miracles in the name of God,。
and yet not be able to enter into the kingdom of heaven,。
this might come as a surprise to some of us.。
But this kind of spiritual self-deception is a possibility that all of us face.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So, why is the disconnect here for these false disciples of Jesus?。
The answer is plain and simple.。
They are doing the right thing, but for the wrong motives or wrong reasons.。
So these false disciples, they crave for the power and status。
that Jesus represents.。
They are not doing the right thing.。
They are doing the wrong thing.。
And they are not doing the right thing.。
So these false disciples, they crave for the power and status。
that Jesus represented.。
But they never truly acknowledge Jesus as the Lord and Master of their life。
by allowing the will of God to control and guide their life.。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
And by the way, just a quick side note,。
this is still true 2,000 years later in our 21st century America,。
where people would use the name of Jesus to gain power, popularity, or even status.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So, be aware of our own self-deception.。
Take an honest look at yourself and examine your intention,。
because we can be doing the right thing for God,。
but for the wrong motives and reason.。
And you don't want to wait until the day of judgment,。
and only to find out that you're being denied entering into the kingdom of heaven.。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
So this is a very stern warning from Jesus, right?。
But again, of course, we all have the freedom to choose。
to either listen to Jesus' warning or to completely ignore it.。
So in this next section of our passage,。
Jesus differentiates between those who truly listen and follow what he has commanded。
versus those who do not.。
And so this is my third and final point, that true hearing requires obedience.。
[speaking Chinese]。
[speaking Chinese]。
So if you look at verse 24, it begins with the word "therefore."。
And what this means is simply that what Jesus is about to say here。
is directly related to what comes before.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So let's read this together.。
"Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine,"。
referring to all Jesus' teaching in the Sermon on the Mount,。
"and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.。
The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house.。
Yet it did not fall, because it has its foundation on the rock.。
But everyone who hears these words of mine,"。
again referring to Jesus' teaching in the Sermon on the Mount,。
"and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.。
The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house.。
And it fell with a great crush."。
[speaking Chinese]。
So the main difference between these two groups of people is that。
the first group in verse 24, they hear these words of Jesus and puts them into practice.。
While the second group in verse 26, they hear these words of Jesus just like the first group,。
but they do not put them into practices.。
[speaking Chinese]。
So Jesus compares the first group to a wise man who builds his house on a solid foundation。
that will stand through all the life, all the winds and storms of life.。
But then he compares the second group to a foolish man who builds his house on sand.。
And when the flood and the rain comes, these two groups of people,。
they do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
They do not put them into practices.。
So tying back to the first examples of the white gate and the broad path that leads to destruction,。
those who share the words of Jesus but do not put them into practice。
will also end up in a similar destiny,。
where the life that they spend years and years building。
will eventually come tumbling down.。
(translation)。
So, we come to the end of Jesus' teaching on the Sermon on the Mount.。
And Matthew, which is the author of this book,。
he then closed his entire section out by resuming the narrative,。
where he concludes,。
"When Jesus has finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at His teaching,。
because He taught as one who had authority and not as the teachers of the law."。
(translation)。
(translation)。
And one of the worst things that could happen after we hear from a sermon like this。
is to think that this has nothing to do with us,。
because Jesus is only speaking to His audience.。
But the truth is, these words of Jesus apply to us today as well.。
We all have to make our own choice to either follow Jesus。
and the way of His kingdom above, or to follow the way of our world.。
And again, Jesus makes it very clear for us, "Enter through the narrow gate."。
(translation)。
(translation)。
So, I have a few questions for us to reflect on today.。
So...。
(translation)。
Are you willing to deny yourself and follow Jesus along this narrow path,。
despite all the trials and challenges that will come your way?。
(translation)。
And are you willing to live a life in full obedience to Jesus,。
even though it means that you have to live in a counter-cultural way?。
(translation)。
So, spend some time in your seat and just reflect on your own,。
and in a few minutes, I'm going to close it out with a prayer.。
(translation)。
(music)。
Let's pray.。
(translation)。
Heavenly Father, You have shown us the way that leads to life through the narrow path.。
So, help us to walk faithfully on this path, even when it is difficult,。
and very few people choose it.。
(translation)。
Protect us from all the deceptions in the world around us,。
and also within ourselves, that would lead us astray.。
And Father, give us the wisdom to discern what is true.。
(translation)。
Jesus, we thank You for Your promise that You will be with us to the end of the earth,。
as we journey along this narrow path.。
(translation)。
And Holy Spirit, come and transform our lives so that we can bear the fruit of Your Spirit.。
(translation)。
In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.。
(translation)。
Well, thanks, Chi, for a challenging message, and let us sing to the Lord.。
