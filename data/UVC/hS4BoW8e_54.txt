Help me。
Sound good。
All right。
All right。
Thank you very much。
Mark thank you very much。
for inviting me back again。
You know。
It's been a couple of weeks。
since I was last here。
And I will probably say。
After I spoke to you guys。
I have been literally。
been on the road。
for the last couple of weeks。
I think I've been more。
in hotel rooms。
and traveling on planes。
than I actually have been at home。
And so it is good to be back here。
at least for the next week。
that I'm off to Seattle this week。
that I'm back in Texas。
and Los Angeles。
for the next couple of weeks。
before finally being home again in June。
We've been starting this series。
on the book of。
the first Kings。
where we looked at the character Elijah。
Elijah when we first began。
in first Kings 17 1-7。
We saw that Elijah literally means。
that our introduction of Elijah was this。
We know that his name literally means。
My God is Jehovah。
DL means My God。
Jah means Jehovah。
I is the connecting point。
My God is Jehovah。
We knew that Elijah is a Tishbite。
from Tishbe in Gilead。
What does that mean。
Merely that。
they have no idea where he lives。
It's somewhere in Gilead。
and he lives in obscurity。
And so this guy who comes from a rural town。
who's kind of rough on the edges。
as you will see。
whose name literally means。
My God is Jehovah。
comes over to King Ahab。
And King Ahab is the king of the northern kingdom。
If you guys remember the back story。
There is a northern kingdom。
during that period of time。
and a southern kingdom。
The southern kingdom is where。
Jerusalem, Nehemiah, Ezra。
All of those guys take place。
Elijah takes place in the northern kingdom。
And in the history of the northern kingdom。
there are 19 kings who rule。
And none of them are good。
All of them are bad。
King Ahab is the worst of all of the kings。
And then there's Queen Jezebel, his wife。
who a lot of times。
when you look at scripture。
Queens are rarely ever mentioned。
Here's a king and here's a queen。
But Jezebel is mentioned。
You know why。
Because Jezebel will turn out to be the worst。
of all of the kings。
including Ahab, including the 18 kings。
She's this bad。
Well, Elijah suddenly gets。
a meeting with the king。
How a guy from Tishbe。
gets a meeting with the king。
who comes out of obscurity。
I don't know。
but he gets a meeting with the king。
And he says that neither dune nor rain。
except by my word。
And he says this in verse 2。
As the Lord the God of Israel lives。
before whom I stand。
That becomes the theme of Elijah's life。
That becomes the theme of this particular passage。
That's Elijah's motivation。
before whom I stand。
That's why he does the things that he does。
He tells them that there will be。
neither dune nor rain。
And just like that。
right in the middle of the action。
God takes him away to Cherith。
And now he lives in Cherith。
He doesn't just stay there。
He lives there。
And he's fed by ravens。
And he's staying there。
until the brook suddenly dries up。
And suddenly in the last time that was here。
which will eventually lead us。
to what we're talking about today。
The word of the Lord came to him。
and says arise go to Zarephath。
So you've been to Cherith。
And now you're going to Zarephath。
which belongs to Sidon。
and dwell there。
Behold I've commanded。
a widow there to feed you。
All right so God you want me to。
When I go against Ahab。
You want me to go to Cherith。
I went to Cherith。
It's nice。
I know you're protecting me。
Ravens fed me。
Brook fed me。
So now I'm happy。
Now you want me to go to Zarephath。
Zarephath literally is a hundred miles。
You want me to walk a hundred miles。
Do you not realize。
that Ahab is coming after me。
Do you not realize my life is in danger。
Yes。
And by the way。
which I never told you this。
Because I found out。
Right before。
Right after I came and spoke。
Zarephath is the birth town。
In the hometown of Queen Jezebel。
So you want me to walk a hundred miles。
Be exposed to danger。
And you want me to go to Jezebel's hometown。
Yes。
And someone's going to be there。
to take care of you。
Great。
He walks a hundred miles。
He risks the danger。
And there he has seen a widow。
Who when he meets in verse 12 says。
As the Lord your God lives。
Here's what she says to him。
He meets a widow。
As the Lord your God lives。
She's not even of the faith。
She doesn't even belong in the faith。
Your God。
I have nothing baked。
I only have a small handful of flour。
And a little oil。
And a jug。
So I have a little baked。
I have a little flour。
I have a little oil。
Really。
And now I am gathering a couple of sticks。
That I may go and prepare it。
For myself and my son。
That we may eat it and die。
Lord。
That's what you're sending me to。
You made me walk a hundred miles。
To the birthplace of the Queen Jezebel。
Who is the worst of everyone。
To meet a widow。
Who has no flour。
Little oil。
And she thinks she's about to die。
Yes。
And as you remembered。
For those who are here。
For those who are not here。
Quickly we talked about three things。
Three things that you need to know。
And two things that you need to overcome。
Number one。
The Lord sees you。
The Lord sees Elijah。
The Lord knows where Elijah is。
He knows that he's been in Tishb。
He knows that he went to see Ahab。
He knows that he was a chariotee。
He knows that he's in Zarephath。
The Lord sees you。
Number two。
The Lord knows where you need to go。
The Lord knows where you need to go。
You need to go to Zarephath。
You just need to go。
It reminds us of Joshua chapter three, right?。
It's after forty years in the wilderness。
To roam around the wilderness。
One day the Lord says to Joshua。
Tell everyone to pack up。
After forty years。
Pack up。
We're going to cross the Jordan River。
But follow me。
I love this verse。
Follow the ark of the covenant。
Because you have never been there before。
And you don't know where to go。
Follow the ark of the covenant。
Because you don't know where to go。
Because you have never, ever been there before。
Not only does the Lord see you。
The Lord knows where you need to go。
But the Lord knows what you need。
Now it may not be what we think we need。
It may not be our expectations of what we need。
But the Lord knows what we need。
He encounters a widow。
Doesn't have a lot but just enough。
He encounters a widow。
And there's two things。
That you need to overcome。
You're going to have to overcome。
First impressions or expectations。
That when we think that。
When we follow the Lord。
There's all these expectations。
Of what God should provide for us。
If we're faithful。
If we're faithful to you。
Here's what I expect out of you。
And we have these expectations。
And when these expectations。
Don't come through。
We get a little frustrated。
We get a little annoyed at God。
And we soon lose trust in God。
So you have to overcome。
These first impressions。
This widow and these expectations。
And trust that God。
Will open those doors as you see fit。
Mark mentioned that。
Some of you guys are graduating。
I was just talking with Rachel。
As she's graduating as well too。
All your life from first grade to second grade。
From third to fourth。
From seventh to eighth。
From eighth to freshman year。
Then from that point you go to college。
You know where you need to go。
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam。
Upon the graduation from college。
It will be the first time。
College graduates look at their life and say。
There are five roads I could take。
There are multiple job offers。
There are master programs that I could take。
I don't know where to go。
And we think that if we take one passage。
If we think that's what God is calling us to do。
Everything will be okay。
And God will provide。
It may not happen。
So you have to overcome。
First impressions or expectations。
And then you're gonna have to overcome。
Physical impossibilities。
He, Elijah, had to overcome。
Physical impossibilities。
He had to overcome the very fact。
That this particular widow。
Didn't have very much。
But then he says to her。
Which I love and which a lot of times。
We actually didn't have enough time to spend on。
Because so today I want to spend time。
On this one verse。
Really unpack it。
And see what it means to me。
He says to her。
Go and do。
Go and do。
You're gonna have。
And here's a。
I'm losing it。
Oh Lord, here we go。
Here we go。
Elijah says to her。
Do not fear。
Go and do as you have said。
Even though you have seen。
All of these impossibilities。
Even though you have seen。
All these expectations。
That are out the window。
He says to the widow。
Go and do。
And that's a calling for us。
As Christ followers。
For us to go and do。
Three things that we're gonna talk about today。
What does it mean for us。
As we look at this particular phrase。
For us as Christ followers。
To go and do。
What does it mean for us not to go and do。
What does that mean for us not to go and do。
What do we do。
As Christ followers。
Three things we're gonna talk about。
What does it mean for us to go and do。
Number two, what does it mean not to go and do。
And what does it mean for us to actually do。
Those three things。
I told you the last three weeks。
I have literally been on the road。
Went to Minnesota for spring break。
With the family。
Went over to Romania。
To the city of Bucharest and Cluj。
Then from that point。
I went over to Prague。
Over the Czech Republic。
And I ended up over in Orlando。
With a bunch of our cohort。
From around the different worlds。
When I went to Romania。
I arrived in Bucharest。
The capital city of Romania。
On Orthodox Easter。
Where the city was completely empty。
It was completely deserted。
Why。
Because it is a huge national holiday。
Did you know in Romania。
90% of all the people。
Who live in the country of Romania。
Will say they're Christians。
Out of that 90%, 80% of them。
Are Orthodox Christians。
Romania as a country。
Is going through a huge rebuild。
Like when I stepped foot in Romania。
I've never been to Romania before。
Some of you guys。
Who have probably studied。
Eastern European history。
That's the only time。
I've ever heard about Romania。
It was embedded in communist regime。
All the way to 1989。
It was ruled by this general secretary。
By the name of Nikolai Ceaușescu。
And he ruled it with an iron hand。
And after his overthrow of the regime in 1989。
Everything started rebuilding。
But it got to a point。
If you know anything about。
What was going on in Romania。
This guy Nikolai Ceaușescu。
Was so obsessed。
About creating his own kingdom。
He ignored the basic necessities。
Of the people there。
He ignored the health of the country。
He ignored the needs。
Until it got to be so much。
They soon overthrew him。
On one of those days。
We visited his former palace。
It is now the parliament。
For where the congress。
And the senate takes place。
When you go into this former palace。
It is humongous。
We walked around。
It took me 25 minutes。
Just to walk around the outer perimeter。
Because it's Orthodox Easter。
So there's no security guard。
I'm sitting there。
Why is there no security guard。
Around the parliament。
I had no idea。
And so you had to walk all the way。
And we kept getting lost。
We finally ended up in this place。
To take a tour of this place。
It is so big。
It is the second biggest。
Government building。
Next to the pentagon。
So of all the different。
Government buildings。
Around the world。
This palace was the second biggest。
They told us that it takes。
$500,000 a month。
To power this thing up。
To pay for all the utilities。
And you know what was ironic。
It was empty。
75% of the building。
Is completely empty。
It was deserted。
And they said unless。
Congress and Senate meets。
It's just empty all the time。
Do you know any groups。
Who would like to rent this room。
It just was crazy。
And here's the one thing。
That's happening in Romania。
We went to Bucharest。
And later on we went to Cluj。
More on Cluj in a little bit。
If there's 90% of people in Romania。
Who says they're Christians。
Why do they have such an issue。
With corruption in Romania。
Because a lot of times。
Back in the days of the communist regime。
Many people had to trust God。
For basic necessities。
They had to trust that God would provide。
They couldn't trust that。
The government would provide。
Because the government。
Was taking all their money。
So a lot of times。
Many of the older baby boomers。
Lived in this regime。
Where their basic needs were not met。
When communists fell in 1989。
Democracy came。
You started bringing a whole new generation。
Who did not live in that regime。
So now you know what happened。
They started attending church。
But now because of those opportunities。
They didn't need to depend on God anymore。
They don't need church anymore。
I'll go on Sundays。
Because that's what is expected。
I've always lived。
I could control my own destiny。
And did they have mentors。
To mentor them as they were growing up。
No。
Because this is the first generation of Christians。
Who now are living in a democratic society。
That is different from their parents。
Their parents couldn't be the mentors。
Because they couldn't understand it。
So suddenly you have all these Christians。
In Romania trying to figure out。
What it means to integrate their faith。
We then went over to Cluj。
Cluj is the second biggest city in Romania。
Cluj was filled with entrepreneurs。
Was filled with university setting。
People with new ideas。
Wanting to change their city。
But at the same time。
Many of the older folks。
There's a huge divide between the church。
And the business leaders。
As they're trying to figure out。
So a lot of times you have these Christians。
Who are living in Romania。
Trying to figure out how。
And what it means to integrate their faith。
From Romania I went over to Prague。
And in Prague we gathered。
This is my second year there。
We gathered all the wealthiest。
European Christians from all of Europe。
Who gathered in one place。
To talk about collaboration。
Because the perception is。
The church is dying in Europe。
But that's not so。
There's so much rebuilding in Europe going on。
And all these wealthy people。
Marketplace leaders are all gathered together。
To come and say。
How do we pull all of our money together。
To engage and see and collaborate。
That's the key thing。
Collaborate in what was Europe。
So from that point on to Prague and to Europe。
And two more stories。
And it ties into what we're talking about。
We then get to Orlando。
And there we gathered。
All of our young marketplace leaders。
From Hong Kong, from Indonesia, from Malaysia。
All of that。
And we have a bunch of different speakers。
We have one speaker。
Who said that who is on his way。
To minister to business leaders。
And CEOs in Hong Kong。
He was going to meet with the CEO of。
The President of Pakistan。
Oh by the way。
He was the former president。
Of a major organization。
A Christian organization。
A 30 million dollar organization。
Whose leader and founder。
Fell from grace。
But fell from grace in a very powerful way。
Because of sexual sin。
And this individual。
Who was the president。
Of this major organization。
Shared about how the entire ministry。
Completely fell and disintegrated。
Because of the sin of one person。
We heard the pain。
As he learned how to rebuild his life。
We also heard the story of Larry Smith。
Larry Smith is the CEO of Tokyo Electron。
He shared his story。
That when his kids graduated from college。
He and his wife sold everything they had。
They sold their mansion。
And they moved to a 300 square foot home。
In a tiny town。
Full of drug addicts。
Full of homeless people。
All of that。
So he could minister to them。
And learn how to build bridges with them。
Why did I tell you all these different stories。
Because each one of those individuals。
Whether you're here or listening today。
Are doing what God has called them to do。
Has continued to be so molded。
And so focused in their calling。
They are walking each day to make a choice。
Because they realize they are stewards。
Of what God has given them。
One speaker said this。
I love what he said。
I wrote it down。
That when you and I are born。
You look like your parents。
But when you die。
You look like your decisions。
When you and I are born。
You look like your parents。
But when you die。
You look like your decisions。
What are the decisions。
That you and I need to make。
To continue to serve and honor the Lord。
In everything that we do。
What does it mean for us to go and do。
Acts 1A tells us。
But you will receive power。
When the Holy Spirit has come upon you。
And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem。
And in all Judea and Samaria。
And to the ends of the earth。
For the longest time when I read this。
I always thought it was just the Great Commission。
We always knew it was the Great Commission。
This is where God wants you to be。
Where's your Samaria。
Where's your Judea。
Where's your all of these different things。
Where's the end of the earth。
I understood it as the Great Commission。
We all see it as the Great Commission。
One pastor one time says to me。
Tommy, have you ever thought。
That besides this being a Great Commission。
How would your perspective change。
If you look at Acts 1A。
Not just as a commission。
But as a declaration。
Because when you look upon it。
As a declaration also。
It changes your perspective。
It creates urgency in what you need to do。
What do I mean。
It says that when you will receive power。
You're definitely going to receive power。
When the Holy Spirit has come upon you。
You will be my witnesses。
It's not a choice。
You're going to be my witnesses in Jerusalem。
You're going to be my witnesses in Judea。
You're going to be my witnesses in Samaria。
Samaria Jews don't go to Samaria。
You will be my witnesses。
In places that you don't want to be。
And you will be my witnesses。
To the end of the earth。
When we see it as just a declaration。
There is no choice。
There is an urgency for what we must do。
It changes our perspective。
It allows us to look at our life。
And what we're doing right now。
And realize the call of the Great Commission。
This declaration that Jesus is coming。
Means that the Holy Spirit is in each one of us。
And we are called to make a difference in our work。
In our family, in our community, in our church。
Not only from the outside, but from the inside。
It's how we live。
It's how we treat people。
It's how we think, all of it。
Because we are witnesses。
Because the Holy Spirit is upon us。
That's what we're supposed to be doing。
It means that we go into places。
Encounter people that aren't Chinese。
It means that we go to people。
Encounter people that are different than us。
In their skin color, in their beliefs。
In their sexual identity。
We engage all those issues。
Because we're Christ followers。
That's what it means to go and do。
That's what it means to be witnesses。
In everything that we do。
To go to places。
That are different than us。
My former boss。
The president of a major seminary。
Once said to me, "Tai。
All we need to do。
Is to teach people to study the Bible。
That's all you need to do。
That's it"。
And I once had to say to this guy, "I disagree with you"。
And I'd love to hear your thoughts later on。
I disagree with you。
Helping people studying the Bible is very key。
But I said to him, "A lot of times。
You have to understand this。
When I see you, you are a white Caucasian man。
President of a seminary。
Where you earn mid-six-figure salaries。
When you first started in a church。
You came into a big church。
Also earned six-digit salaries。
When you left the seminary and went to a church。
Another church hired you。
And gave you a big six-digit salary。
You never had to worry。
About racial discrimination。
You never had to worry about money。
You never had to worry about。
Any of those different things。
But some of us do。
Some of us have to deal。
Some of the issues in culture。
We're going to have to deal。
With racial discrimination。
We're going to have to deal with money。
And so a lot of times。
And for all of us。
As Christ followers。
Dealing with studying the Bible is great。
It's very great。
But we as Christians。
Have to learn how to engage the culture。
We have to learn to address the culture。
We have to learn to be。
What it means to really be able to be。
Engaging with the Christ-filled mind。
That's what it means to take the gospel。
To all the ends of the earth。
What does it not mean。
Here's what it does not mean。
It does not mean that you live。
Like a nomad like John the Baptist。
And be in need and give up everything。
Sometimes I think we as Christians。
Say, "I'm not dealing with this。
"Because it means that I live this poor life。
And it's like, no, it doesn't。
For some people, they've chosen to do it。
But for us as Christ followers。
It does not mean that we give up everything。
Like John the Baptist。
But here's what it does mean。
It means that you do not get to。
Pick and choose when to follow Jesus。
It does not mean that you get to。
Pick and choose when to follow Jesus。
We pick and choose。
When we pick and choose。
When to follow Jesus。
It doesn't lead to transformation。
That means that every single day。
When you and I wake up。
Our mentality is。
We are a steward of grace。
We are a steward of the grace。
That God has given us。
We are a steward of God's will in our lives。
And how do we use those talents and strengths。
To continue to make a difference。
To live a life that glorifies Him。
In every single way。
Luke 14, 26 tells us。
If anyone comes to me。
And does not hate his own father and mother。
And wife and children。
And brothers and sisters。
Yes, and even his own life。
He cannot be my disciple。
And as an Asian person。
A lot of times there's a lot of honor and respect。
That we have toward our family。
And when we read this, we say。
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you want me to hate my mom and dad。
That's not very nice。
What it means is that your dedication。
Your focus, your frame of mind。
Your focus of mind。
Is so strong every single day。
That when it is compared to your relation。
With anything else。
You are hating your mother。
You are hating your father, your wife, your children。
Your own brothers。
That's the focus that we need to have。
We don't need to pick and choose。
We don't even get to pick and choose。
It's our focus every single day。
Why?。
Because the Holy Spirit is within us。
And when the Holy Spirit is within us。
We are called to go and do。
When the Holy Spirit is within us。
We go and do to go to Samaria。
We go and do over in Jerusalem。
We go and do over in all the ends here。
That's what we're called to go and do。
And that means every single day。
We are light on the city of a hill。
To make a difference in our own lives。
In the lives of other people。
But the problem is in Christianity。
We've created a Christianity。
And I'm not sure for those who are watching。
We've created a Christianity。
Where no one wants to be part of us。
We've created a Christianity。
Where people are sick and tired of us。
We've gotten too cute。
Where we sit there and look at pastors。
These days who love their platforms。
I was literally on Facebook the other day。
And I came across these ads on。
How do you help your pastors in church。
Snippet their sermons。
And create instant reels。
And create their platform。
We've gotten to a point where we're too cute。
That we love to be influencers。
And we want to create these platforms。
We've gotten too cute。
In the sense that a lot of times。
Here in the US。
We've started fighting over dumb things。
We want to know who's right。
On the political spectrum。
We want to know who we're supporting。
And within the church。
That has completely divided us。
We want to know that we're right。
And you better believe。
There's no longer dialogue。
And conversations and arguments。
All of these things。
Because everybody wants to be right。
And the rest of the world。
Has been watching us。
And they are looking at us and say。
If that's the way the church is。
If that is the people。
And the leaders that we encounter。
If that is the hypocrisy that we see。
If that is what we're dealing with。
With pastors who want to create their platform。
With people using each other。
With people misspending money。
With people fighting all the time。
Then why in the world。
Do I want to be part of that church。
Because as Christ followers。
We do not have a singularity of mind。
To know that every single day。
We're going to deal with different people。
And every single day。
Through the power of the Holy Spirit。
We are called to take his gospel。
To every part。
And to encounter people。
Who are different to us。
That has different opinions。
And how do you show God。
In a loving way。
That's what we do。
So what do we do。
Couple of things as we wrap up。
Couple of things。
How has God designed you。
How has he gifted you。
What are the skills that he has given you。
We're not all called to do the same thing。
We're all called to have the same focus。
But we're not called to have to do the same thing。
Peter was not sent to the nations。
Paul was sent to the nations。
But did Peter have to learn。
The importance of what it meant。
To reach out to Gentiles。
He did。
Joseph was called to be a city official。
To be the chief of staff。
To really be able to nurture。
During that period of time。
Nehemiah was called to rebuild。
The walls of Jerusalem。
At a later age。
Before that he was called to be。
A faithful cupbearer to the king。
Zacchaeus of all of those guys。
Was not like Matthew。
Called to leave his role as a tax collector。
And follow Jesus。
And be one of his disciples。
He was called to be a chief tax collector。
And stay at his job。
And be faithful at his job。
What do we do。
It comes down to how God has created you。
And designed you to be。
It comes down to how God has gifted you。
And the passions that he has given in your heart。
We're all called to take the gospel。
To the ends of the earth。
We are not called to pick and choose。
When we follow God。
But how that looks like。
Is going to be different。
For each person。
And it's going to involve your time。
It's going to involve your outlook。
It's going to involve your motivation。
And it's going to involve your money。
It's going to involve all of those things。
As we seek to follow God。
In all that we do。
That's really what we're called。
When Elijah says to the widow。
Go and do。
God says the same thing for you。
Go and do。
Go and do。
Because if our motivation。
Is the grace of the cross。
What does it mean for you to go and do。
What does it mean for you to go and do in your work。
What does it mean to go and do in your family。
What does it mean to go and do。
To engage with people who are different than you。
We're called to go and do。
We're called to engage with people who are different。
Who think differently。
Who act differently than we are。
That's what we're called to do。
How that looks。
Is going to be different for each person。
Father, thank you for the words of Elijah。
You call us to go and do。
Where do we go and do。
How do we go and do。
We know one thing, Lord。
We don't get to pick and choose when we go and do。
But may we be aware of open doors。
And open opportunities。
May we be aware of how this affects all of our life。
Both our inner character and our outer lives。
How it affects our money, our calling。
Our decisions that we make。
Our motivation, Lord。
Help us to understand what that go and do means。
Help us as we reflect upon that phrase。
Wrestle with that word, those words。
And help us to see you in the midst of it。
Christ, we pray, amen。
