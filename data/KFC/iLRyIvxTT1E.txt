Good morning, everyone.。
Today we are going to talk about the fourth chapter.。
This picture is about a tree, or a plant, if you remember.。
I thought of a famous V-Thot, but I was afraid that people would complain if I uploaded it.。
So I will use a German word.。
I heard the pronunciation, but I might have read it wrong.。
It's Schadenfreude.。
I will sing it again.。
Schadenfreude.。
Let's give Gabriel a round of applause.。
Schadenfreude.。
You might have guessed the meaning of this word if you watched the video.。
Let me show you what it means.。
I think Gabriel might know, but let me show you.。
The hint is that it is in the Oxford Dictionary.。
But it is a combination of two German words.。
Schadenfreude.。
I checked it online, so I might be wrong.。
Schaden means damage.。
And Freude means joy.。
Can you guess what this word means?。
The first one is damage, and the second one is joy.。
Joy over damage.。
Joy over damage.。
Yes, that's the German composition.。
What is this word?。
I chose this one.。
If I know the Chinese name, I will use the Chinese idiom "幸"。
幸在樂和。
I know there is a more common phrase in Hong Kong.。
It means "I am happy to see others being embarrassed."。
I won't post this one.。
I thought about it for a long time, but I was afraid that people would complain.。
But you don't need to tell me what you know.。
I read this when I was preparing for this talk.。
This is a common phrase in psychology.。
We don't want people to die or get hurt.。
But even if your friend is hurt,。
you might think it's funny.。
This is a common phrase in psychology.。
Why did I choose this word?。
Because the context is the same.。
The fourth chapter is the same.。
Why did I choose this word?。
The fourth chapter is a summary of the story.。
In the first chapter,。
John is very unhappy and angry.。
I want to make sure that you know the progress.。
What does this mean?。
What does "it" mean?。
I think someone is thinking.。
I will not say it.。
Thank you for answering.。
The third chapter talks about "repentance."。
Do you think that a normal repentance should be...。
Let's say you have a friend.。
What would you do when you believe in Jesus?。
Let's say you don't have any regrets.。
Does anyone think it's bad to believe in Jesus?。
No? Okay. That's good.。
I think in a normal situation,。
even if I'm not very close to my friend,。
let's say you're sitting here.。
You're not home to sleep.。
Let's say you think that believing in Jesus is useful。
or a good thing.。
When you believe in Jesus,。
even if you're not very close to your friend,。
you will still be very...。
Not only will you be partying.。
In the New Testament, Jesus gives an analogy.。
If there is a man on the earth who is saved,。
then there are angels in heaven who will bless him.。
This is probably...。
Even if we haven't reached that level,。
I still think it's a good thing.。
But do you remember what John's reaction was?。
Why did I forget so quickly?。
Yes, he was angry.。
Angry about what?。
Why was he angry about the ashes?。
This is a bit further.。
We explained a little bit about this in the past few weeks.。
Of course, we are a very bad person.。
A person who hurts others.。
I don't know if you've been bullied in school.。
I hope you haven't.。
But if you have, then...。
Okay.。
Imagine someone who hurts you believes in Jesus.。
What would your reaction be?。
Someone who hurts you says he believes in Jesus.。
What would your reaction be?。
What would your reaction be?。
Sorry?。
Oh, you love that guy.。
Okay, that's a positive.。
I appreciate a positive response.。
But it's obvious that Vietnam doesn't respond like this.。
Vietnam is angry.。
Why is he angry?。
There's a saying in the back.。
What is he angry about?。
What did he say?。
He said, "I know God is gracious and merciful.。
He has a generous love, and is not easily angry.。
He has a great desire to repent and is not easily discouraged.。
So he ran away."。
You might think,。
"We came back today,。
and I know God is such a good God.。
So I should respond to him."。
But Vietnam said, "I have to run away.。
I have to run away."。
If you remember chapter 1,。
it was a few weeks ago.。
You might not remember.。
In chapter 1,。
he had to take a boat to the west.。
We don't really know what happened at the beginning.。
If you look at the first chapter of the book of John,。
it's just that John said to John,。
"You have to go there."。
But in the book of Kings,。
he went straight to the other side.。
So the whole crime scene,。
until this moment,。
is what the reason is.。
What is it?。
"So John knew God was gracious and merciful.。
He has a generous love,。
and is not easily angry.。
He has a great desire to repent and is not easily discouraged.。
Normally, your response is,。
"That's good. I think it's good."。
But John was angry.。
John thought these people were not worthy.。
It was not worth it for God to love him like that.。
There will be an action later。
that shows that he thought that way.。
But if we look at the last chapter,。
we find that John knew.。
John knew what God was.。
But he chose not to follow.。
Why do I say he knew?。
Because if we look at the last chapter,。
let's say you listened to it last week.。
Let's say you listened to it.。
Did John know what God was?。
Did he know?。
Someone said they knew.。
You said you knew.。
Let's zoom in.。
You said you knew.。
Did John know what God was?。
He didn't know.。
Maybe he thought it was good.。
But if we look at the third chapter,。
the ninth chapter,。
what did John say?。
He said, "Who knows?"。
Everyone's English is better than mine.。
"Who knows?"。
"Who knows" is "知" or "唔知"?。
He didn't know.。
When they kneeled down,。
they didn't know.。
They were afraid of dying.。
But John knew.。
John knew what God was.。
Let's read it again.。
"God who has grace and mercy,。
who does not easily go astray,。
who has a loving and loving heart,。
and who never regrets what he says."。
But you find that the "who knows"。
is a very proper response.。
When we say we believe in Jesus,。
we have to repent.。
So a person who doesn't know God。
has a very proper response.。
They repent and say,。
"Maybe God will regret and not go astray."。
You see I'm highlighting this.。
The author is clearly making a parallel.。
John knew what happened.。
But because he knew,。
he had to go astray.。
So if you look at it from this perspective,。
even John's prayer...。
We can learn a lot from John's prayer.。
I can learn a lot from the content of his prayer.。
It's not that the prayer itself is a bad thing.。
But if we look at it from this perspective,。
even if the second chapter is a good prayer,。
a prayer that gives us a lot of reflection,。
it also says that I am right.。
I am right in following you.。
I know you.。
Those people don't know you, but I know you.。
I know you will save me.。
The "who knows" is very proper.。
In today's terms,。
the "who knows" is very proper.。
But you see the response.。
He is even worse than a little king who doesn't know God.。
Who knows?。
He knows, but he chooses not to follow.。
So why did Vietnam refuse to go?。
They were so unworthy of death.。
The reason is that only this chapter is seen.。
If we didn't have previous accounts or see the crime scene,。
we would have only realized that。
they really wanted to see people die.。
They were happy to see people die.。
It's not just about falling.。
What he is saying is that people died.。
If you remember what he said in the third chapter,。
if you go to the fourth chapter, your city will collapse.。
Your people will all die.。
He said it to this extent.。
So the real problem with Vietnam。
is not that he doesn't know God.。
The real problem with Vietnam is that he doesn't accept,。
he is not willing for God to use his。
dislike and not-expecting way to do things.。
What does that mean?。
God sometimes gives you some humiliation,。
or gives you something you don't want.。
You think you don't want it at that moment.。
You think, "What's wrong with that?"。
"You said you would give me something good."。
I believe, not just me,。
I believe everyone has a lot of experiences like this.。
Why don't you give me a good half?。
Why do you give me a breakup?。
Of course, if God is willing to give you another half,。
you will be very happy.。
But a lot of people can't find it.。
So he asks, "Why don't you give me one?"。
"I know you are this kind of God. Why don't you give me one?"。
Luckily, this is what happened to Joanna.。
If God is really this bad,。
what would Joanna do?。
She would just use a thunderbolt to kill him.。
And that would be the end of the story.。
But that's not what happened.。
We are very grateful that God is a God with compassion.。
So what?。
God wants him to know him more.。
How does he know him?。
Through an action.。
Let me ask you.。
This is the first four chapters.。
When Joanna complained to God,。
God knew she was this good, so he didn't follow her.。
God knew she wouldn't punish them.。
God asked her, "Is this right?"。
She said, "No."。
But do you think Joanna would not be angry?。
What would she do?。
She would continue to be angry.。
What does the Bible say?。
Some people are looking for the Bible.。
What does the Bible say?。
What did she do next?。
Sorry?。
She would rather die, but she did one thing.。
She didn't leave this time.。
In the first chapter, she left after hearing God's words.。
She didn't leave this time.。
She didn't leave to take a boat.。
What did she do?。
I forgot the script.。
I don't know this part.。
What did she do?。
She went to the other side of the city.。
She sat down.。
What do you think she was doing?。
She didn't wait.。
Let's look at the IG.。
I appreciate the answer.。
What was she doing?。
She was sitting there.。
What happened?。
She was sitting there, waiting for her death.。
The Bible didn't say that.。
It said, "Let's see what happens in the city."。
But if we read this, we know she was waiting for her death.。
It's actually very contradictory.。
You ask her,。
she knows very well what God is like.。
So God said that,。
and she didn't do it.。
She knew it was over.。
She didn't have a choice.。
She sat there, waiting for her death.。
But she still had to wait.。
So she was angry.。
I agree that she was angry.。
But at least she made some progress.。
She didn't just leave.。
She didn't just leave and ignore it.。
She had to see it.。
Let's think about this.。
She was a prophet.。
Even if we're not prophets,。
we feel that if someone believes in Jesus,。
we should be happy.。
It's normal to feel happy when your friend is in heaven.。
Don't believe in Jesus.。
But she brought a whole city of people.。
It's not that she believed in God.。
But at least a whole city of people repented.。
She was really something.。
But she was still angry.。
She didn't like it.。
But God didn't let her go.。
She was clearly sitting there,。
waiting for her death.。
But God didn't punish her directly.。
What did God do?。
The Bible says that God gave her a plant.。
I'm not familiar with plants.。
I've never seen one.。
Anyway, it's a plant.。
This plant is taller than the heat.。
What does that mean?。
It's a bit of geographical knowledge.。
For example,。
the location of Iran today.。
You know, those places are not like...。
There are not many trees.。
It's not a rainforest.。
In fact, the central area is full of deserts.。
There are a lot of mines.。
If you remember, the mine area...。
The Israelis have been walking for 40 years.。
So those places have no responsibility.。
If you sit across from them,。
you'll be dead if you sit there and look.。
God gave her a plant.。
It's taller than her head.。
It covers her.。
Although we've seen this sentence before,。
this sentence has a little trick.。
The Bible says that this tree delivers her.。
It makes her less suffering.。
It helps her get out of the suffering.。
To put it simply,。
there are many words for suffering.。
In English, you can say pain,。
discomfort,。
or suffering.。
But in the author's dictionary,。
he deliberately uses the phrase。
to refer to the sin of God saving the Lilliputians.。
The Lilliputians are sinners.。
The first chapter says they are sinners.。
It's the same word.。
What does it mean?。
God saved the Lilliputians from their sin.。
At least, that's what it means.。
Although Vietnam didn't save them.。
If you don't repent, you'll be dead.。
But God saved the Lilliputians。
from their sin.。
It's the same word.。
God saved the Lilliputians。
from their discomfort.。
At least, they don't have to be burned.。
It's the same word.。
Of course, it's not that Vietnam is evil.。
That's not what it means.。
But there's a clear balance here.。
God saved the Lilliputians。
from their suffering.。
He's willing to save those。
who seem like bad people.。
He's willing to save those。
who seem like bad people。
from their sin.。
Sin can make us suffer.。
We believe in that.。
If the story stops here,。
it's a happy ending.。
If the sin stops here, it's a happy ending.。
But does anyone remember。
what happened next?。
The tree is here.。
Was it dead or what?。
It wasn't dead.。
It was dead.。
It was called dead and dried up.。
The tree was dead.。
It was a tree that was dead.。
You have a script.。
Some people have a script.。
I don't remember.。
What does the sin say?。
God turned the tree into a tree.。
The tree was forced to grow.。
It's obvious that it wasn't planted.。
It was God who let it grow.。
What did God do the next day?。
He bit the tree with a worm.。
He bit it until it was dry.。
Not only that,。
God also told him to make the place。
(the wilderness)。
to be sun-dried.。
What did the devil do?。
He planted a tree.。
He should be angry。
because he's planting a tree.。
He said, "I'm going to die."。
He's throwing a tantrum.。
He's always throwing a tantrum.。
He's throwing a tantrum since the first chapter.。
So what did the devil do?。
God asked him,。
"Why are you angry?。
Are you angry at the tree?"。
He's not angry at God.。
He's angry at the tree.。
What did the devil say?。
He said, "I'm angry to death.。
It's reasonable.。
I deserve it."。
I should be able to change my mind.。
I deserve it.。
When you ask him if he knows。
the tree was given to him by God,。
he might know.。
He did something for God.。
He should have this.。
He deserves this treatment.。
So God gave him a final lesson.。
In this book,。
we call it an open ending.。
Because at this point,。
after God gave the final lesson,。
we don't know the answer.。
What lesson did he give?。
What did God say?。
God said, "This plant is not for you to plant.。
It's not for you to nurture."。
It's not for you to nurture.。
It's not for you to grow up.。
It's not for you to grow up.。
It's not for you to die.。
It's for you to love.。
It's compassion.。
It's for you to love.。
In the 11th chapter,。
"However, you are not yet mature.。
You cannot tell the difference。
between the left and the right hand.。
There are more than 120,000 people。
and many of them are new.。
How can I not love?"。
You will find that the 10th and 11th chapters。
are all about this.。
Let's talk about the first thing。
that is easy to understand.。
John clearly knew。
what kind of God he was.。
He memorized it correctly.。
In today's terms,。
he graduated from the Academy of God。
with full marks.。
He memorized the verses of the Gospel,。
"There is compassion, there is love,。
there is not easy way, there is a way."。
He had a good theology.。
He had a good theology.。
It doesn't mean that he did a good thing.。
His problem was that。
he found that God's work。
was in contradiction with what he wanted.。
Of course, we can see that。
this is a translation that。
is most commonly adopted.。
It's like asking him。
if he was willing to love people。
just for himself.。
I will talk about。
how to understand this in the following section.。
I said earlier that John had a good theology.。
John's problem was not。
that he didn't know what God was like.。
He knew.。
You could say that he had full marks。
for knowing things.。
But knowing doesn't mean that。
he was willing to accept。
what God said.。
He didn't like it.。
He didn't know that what God said was true.。
Of course, we need to emphasize that。
God didn't just love.。
If we just stop here,。
we will think that God loves everyone.。
But if we remember from the Bible,。
Pastor Karen mentioned this。
in his first sermon.。
People are always bad.。
So God did judge in the end.。
Today, we are not reading the book of Nahuels.。
You can go back and read it yourself.。
In the end, God still。
judged this.。
God still has punishment.。
Of course, you can say that。
God repented.。
But you can also imagine that。
after someone repents, they will commit a crime again.。
Or, after they repent, they deliberately commit a crime again.。
Today, when we believe in Jesus,。
we will sometimes fall, sometimes get up.。
But if they repent,。
they deliberately do it,。
I don't believe it. I don't like it.。
So God still judged in the end.。
So, apart from the question I asked,。
if we look at the structure of culture,。
to put it simply,。
it can be changed to another meaning,。
which is that I will not love this God anymore.。
Of course,。
does that mean it's different? No.。
Actually, the application is still the same.。
John's theology is not wrong.。
It's not that he doesn't recognize this God.。
It's that he recognizes。
his mistake.。
But he doesn't like。
this God to do this.。
He doesn't like God。
to use his time to work.。
After this, you can choose to use the first question.。
Because there are indeed many。
traditions or many scholars believe that.。
I put two questions here.。
But I think both are the same application.。
We can be very familiar with this God.。
But at the end of the day,。
we don't like。
to do His things。
in His time.。
As I said, John。
is a person who values。
his freedom.。
I think this is especially true。
for our society today.。
We value our freedom.。
I think it's not just an iPhone.。
Actually, iPhone is also an "I".。
We have a lot of things。
that we want to show ourselves.。
So even if I come back to church。
and recognize this God,。
what definition do I use for myself?。
For example, I am a pastor.。
I am a pastor.。
I am a leader.。
I am a junior.。
I don't have many services.。
But as we grow up,。
we will define ourselves.。
We will slowly realize。
that God is like this.。
We can memorize it.。
I remember when I taught。
Avana two weeks ago,。
I was very impressed by。
a very short boy in the class.。
Don't ask me who he is.。
But,。
it was a Bible Q&A competition.。
He was the most suitable one.。
He was the most suitable one.。
He even mentioned the names.。
I intentionally gave him some difficult ones.。
Because the questions were too simple.。
He answered them well.。
Then I asked him directly,。
"You know so many Bibles,。
but do you believe in Jesus?"。
He told me,。
"Actually, I don't know if I believe in Jesus."。
He knew all the stories。
in the Bible.。
All the characters in the Bible.。
But he said, "Actually, I am not sure if I believe in Jesus."。
I hope I am not talking about you.。
Sometimes, we don't like God。
using a method we don't expect.。
We like God's timing.。
God's timing is good, we can say.。
But, after we have said all these,。
we still feel uncomfortable.。
It is normal to feel uncomfortable.。
It is okay to struggle with God.。
But if I don't like what you are doing,。
I will not follow you.。
This is the problem.。
Faith is not an intellectual exercise.。
If I can think it through,。
I will believe in Jesus.。
Just like Jonah, he could think through。
what God was.。
But an intellectual exercise。
will not help us。
understand God.。
God wants us to have a personal relationship.。
He wants us to renew our relationship.。
He wants us to stop at what we like,。
what we are obsessed with.。
Maybe that is my emotion.。
Maybe some people are touched by the song.。
Maybe some people like to make。
philosophical arguments, and are happy.。
Some people like to insist on the theory,。
and are happy.。
But in the end, God does not want us。
to stick to these things.。
God wants us to really know Him.。
I invite the team to sing。
"Reconciliation" with us.。
"Reconciliation" has two lines.。
The first line is about us.。
Today is the Pentecost.。
I think many of us have parents。
who grew up in this church.。
Some of them believe in Jesus.。
We are probably second generation Christians.。
Maybe we have a lot of traditions。
in our childhood.。
We have our religion.。
This is really a religion,。
but in the eyes of others.。
But as the conclusion says,。
God never expects us to be weak.。
God really wants us to know Him.。
He wants us to have compassion。
not only for ourselves,。
but also for others,。
like God does.。
I invite the team to sing "Reconciliation"。
with us.。
I invite the team to sing "Reconciliation" with us.。
(speaking in foreign language)。
