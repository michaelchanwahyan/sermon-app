Good morning, Explorers.。
Today's sermon asks a simple question.。
Are you a growing Christian?。
Let me repeat that.。
Are you a growing Christian?。
I want to start with a personal story.。
I've not always been a pastor.。
When I came to Hong Kong in 1987,。
yes, I know it was before you were born,。
except Pastor Johnny,。
I was a businessman.。
And you'll see a picture of me as a businessman.。
In 1995,。
I joined a church。
that was called Repulse Bay Baptist Church.。
The pastor, who was an Aussie,。
was a good friend.。
Now, there were two problems about that church.。
Firstly, it wasn't in Repulse Bay.。
And secondly, it wasn't a Baptist church.。
The next problem is that the pastor left in 1996.。
And we were left with a church with a silly name,。
no pastor, about 40 people, and no money.。
I remember preaching a sermon in December 1996。
on John chapter 15,。
the chapter where Jesus spoke about being the vine and us being the branches.。
I remember it well.。
I mentioned in this chapter。
that this chapter called for a church that was Christ-centered,。
abiding in Him, relationship-based, fruitful, and poured out.。
You can see the analogy between the vine and church.。
Anyway, we decided in January 1997,。
as the church wasn't in Repulse Bay,。
and it wasn't a Baptist church,。
to change its name.。
And given my sermon weeks before,。
the name "The Vine" was chosen.。
Little did I know then。
that I would become its first senior pastor.。
The rest, as they say, is history.。
And for the past five years,。
I've been honored to be part of the team here at KFC.。
And it is my honor to speak to explorers,。
as I have a heart for the future generation.。
At the beginning, I asked a simple question.。
Are you a growing Christian?。
Now, if I offered you a measuring device。
designed to measure spiritual growth in a believer's life,。
what would you find?。
Today, we have all sorts of fancy gadgets。
that can measure just about anything.。
For instance, they can measure our height, our weight,。
including the amount of body fat that we have。
versus the amount of muscle.。
We can measure our cholesterol level,。
our blood pressure, our sugar level,。
and so many things.。
We can diagnose everything about us physically,。
but today I want to give you a tool。
that can help you measure。
how well you are doing spiritually.。
In fact, I want to give you four spiritual tools。
called disciplines。
that can help you measure how you are doing spiritually.。
Open your Bibles or your smartphones。
to John's Gospel, chapter 15.。
I'm going to read the first eight verses。
of this wonderful, transforming chapter of God's Word,。
the chapter that gave the church the name "Divine" 24 years ago.。
Let's start off with the first five verses.。
This is Jesus speaking.。
I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.。
Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, He takes away,。
and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes,。
that it might bear more fruit.。
Already you are clean because of the word I have spoken to you.。
Abide in me.。
And I in you.。
As the branch cannot bear fruit by itselfunless it abides in the vine,。
neither can you unless you abide in me.。
I am the vine.。
You are the branches.。
Whoever abides in me, and I in him,。
he it is that bears much fruit.。
For apart from me, you can do nothing.。
Our Lord Jesus Christ taught His disciples。
that the key to spiritual growth is。
Now get this, now get this.。
The key to spiritual growth is abiding in Him.。
He said in verse 5,。
six words that can change the way you live your Christian life.。
Without me, you can do nothing.。
Until you come to terms with the reality。
of your need to abide daily with Christ,。
you'll always be a yo-yo Christian,。
up and down, up and down,。
up one minute, down the next.。
On fire for God one day,。
and burned out the next.。
I believe that many Christians today。
can be found living in two extremes.。
On one hand, there are those Christians。
who are what I call active but empty.。
And secondly, there are Christian church members today。
who are apathetic and empty.。
That's right.。
I believe Christians who are in an all out sprint。
can just be as empty in their lives。
as Christians who are watching from the sidelines.。
You see, we've lost our focus。
on what it takes to be a growing believer.。
We're engaged either in activity or passivity.。
When what God truly wants is for us to be abiding.。
Abiding in Christ means to remain in,。
to stay in, or even continue in。
a constant continuing, committed, concentrated,。
called out relationship with Jesus Christ as Lord.。
So what are the tools or spiritual disciplines。
we need to measure our Christian growth?。
Firstly, the spiritual discipline of abiding in the word.。
John 15,7.。
Look at John 15,7.。
Jesus said, "If you abide in me,。
and my words abide in you."。
Stop reading right there.。
Jesus is telling us。
if we want to be a growing believer,。
a disciple, we must abide in his word.。
In John chapter 8, verses 31 and 32,。
the Bible tells us.。
So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him,。
"If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples,。
and you will know the truth,。
and the truth will set you free."。
The way to have Christ living in us。
is to have the word in us.。
The word is food to us.。
Matthew 4,4 says this,。
"But he answered, 'It is written,。
"Man shall not live by bread alone,。
but by every word that comes from the mouth of God."。
And Romans 10,17 says,。
"So faith comes by hearing,。
and hearing through the word of God."。
Those words, "Faith comes by hearing,"。
are really special to us here at Confluct Church.。
We're currently part of the ONE campaign,。
which is happening all around the world.。
I found out this week that 183 countries around the world。
are taking part in the ONE campaign,。
and there's only 195 countries in the world.。
And we have a vision, don't we,。
to take the gospel to the whole world by 2033,。
that the gospel will be available in every language,。
and we are part of that.。
Now we receive the word in many ways.。
Number one, listening to the word of God taught or preached.。
I hope you're hearing the voice of God this morning.。
Secondly, reading the word of God,。
including orally listening to the word of God.。
Number three, studying the word of God.。
Number four, memorizing the word of God.。
Number five, meditating on the word of God.。
And number six, and probably most importantly,。
applying the word of God to our lives.。
Now notice I've done something on the slides。
to help you and understand,。
remember these four spiritual disciplines。
necessary to grow as a believer.。
I have presented the first discipline。
in the lower vertical portion of the cross.。
That indicates just how we are to abide in Christ,。
by abiding in his word here on earth.。
His word enables us to live for Christ effectively.。
Psalm 119 says,。
I have stored your word in my heart。
that I might not sin against you.。
Other versions say,。
I have hidden your word in my heart.。
How are you doing?。
Do you love God's word?。
Do you read it?。
Do you study it?。
Memorize it?。
Do you live it?。
Do you obey God's word?。
Abiding in God's word。
means we live the word。
as much as we read the word.。
God's word has the power。
to transform your life.。
Its teachings will radically change。
your thinking and thus,。
your lifestyle.。
Number two,。
the spiritual discipline。
of praying in the faith.。
Again, verse 7,。
if you abide in me and my words abide in you,。
you will ask what you desire。
and it shall be done for you.。
Another important discipline。
necessary for Christian growth。
is praying in faith.。
Look again at verse 7.。
And this time,。
let's read the whole verse.。
If you abide in me,。
my words abide with you,。
you will ask what you desire。
and it shall be done for you.。
A growing Christian。
should have or should be developing。
and maintaining a lifestyle of praying.。
So how do we pray?。
Matthew chapter 6.。
Jesus said,。
when you pray,。
by the way,。
he didn't say if you pray.。
He said,。
when you pray,。
don't be like the hypocrite。
who love to pray publicly。
on street corners。
and in the synagogue。
where everyone can see them.。
I assure you,。
that is all the reward。
they will ever get.。
But when you pray,。
go away by yourself,。
shut the door behind you。
and pray to your Father。
secretly.。
Then your Father。
who knows all secrets。
will reward you.。
I got six observations.。
Number one,。
Jesus assumes that。
as his children,。
we will pray.。
When you pray,。
as I said.。
Secondly,。
pray to God the Father,。
not to be heard of men.。
Number three,。
have a private。
place of prayer.。
Some of us call it。
a prayer closet.。
Number four,。
be consistent.。
Number five,。
keep a prayer journal.。
And then when the prayers。
are answered,。
you can tick them off.。
And number six is。
follow a pattern of prayer.。
And there are different。
patterns of prayer.。
You can pray according。
to the Lord prayer.。
Our Father in heaven,。
Hallowed be your name,。
etc.。
Or you can pray。
according to。
what I call acts.。
ACTS.。
I put them on the screen.。
Adoration,。
confession,。
thanksgiving,。
supplication.。
That's a long word。
that basically means asking.。
Now notice the upper。
vertical portion of the cross。
points upward to heaven or God。
and indicates the way。
we communicate with God。
through prayer and faith.。
Number three,。
you still with me?。
Good.。
The spiritual discipline。
of fellowshipping with believers.。
Fellowshipping,。
and I know it's difficult。
in this Zoom period.。
It refers to the special relationship。
we share with all other believers.。
All true Christians。
have a fellowship,。
a true partnership。
with other believers.。
Our mutual faith。
in Christ builds a bond。
of communion and commitment。
with one another.。
We need one another.。
We are a family.。
You are my brothers and sisters.。
Abiding in Christ。
means we will seek to live。
in fellowship with our brothers。
and sisters in Christ.。
John 13 says this,。
A new commandment I give you,。
that you love one another。
just as I have loved you.。
You are to love one another.。
By this all men will know。
that you are my disciples。
if you have love for one another.。
God has provided a home。
for his children.。
It's called the church.。
He has provided explorers.。
He has even given us the T-shirt.。
The church is the place。
where relationships are nurtured,。
where love is expressed,。
compassion shared,。
encouragement given。
and acceptance offered.。
It is the beginning point of ministry.。
It is the body of Christ。
here on earth,。
a living, growing body.。
If you are to abide in Christ,。
you must abide in his church.。
You will never find。
a well-balanced Christian。
who is not involved in the church。
of Lord Jesus Christ somewhere.。
Now notice the word fellowship。
is written on the right side。
of the horizontal portion of the cross.。
The horizontal part of the cross。
represents the important relationship。
we Christians are to have with others.。
Just as the vertical part of the cross。
points to our relationship with God,。
so the horizontal part。
indicates the importance。
of our relationship with others。
if we are to be growing disciples.。
Not only are we to have relationship。
with other believers through the church。
called fellowship,。
but we are also to have a relationship。
with unbelievers in the world。
and that's called witnessing.。
That leads me to my last point.。
Number four,。
the spiritual discipline。
of witnessing to the world.。
Verse 8.。
By this my father is glorified。
that you bear much fruit。
so you will be my disciples.。
Jesus said that the way。
to show that we are disciples。
is to bear much fruit.。
That's why I loved。
the picture of the grapes.。
Witnessing is the natural outgoing,。
is the natural outgrowth。
of the abiding and growing Christian life.。
If we are to live in his word,。
pray in faith,。
and fellowship with believers,。
it will be natural and normal。
to share with others。
what Christ is doing in our lives.。
In fact,。
you won't be able to help。
but share or witness to those around you.。
Bearing fruit is more than witnessing,。
but it always involves witnessing.。
Jesus said to his first disciples。
who were all fishermen,。
I will make you fishers of men.。
Jesus also said,。
you shall be my witnesses.。
Are you a witness for Christ?。
Now notice once again。
that the first two spiritual disciplines。
deal with our relationship to God.。
That relationship is represented。
by a vertical relationship.。
When we hear the word,。
God speaks to us.。
When we pray,。
we speak to God.。
The last two spiritual disciplines。
deal with our relationship to fellow men.。
This is a horizontal relationship。
between a believer,。
the church and the world.。
When we faithfully attend church。
with other believers,。
when we are faithful to share Christ。
with the lost,。
then we are witnessing to the world.。
If you truly desire。
to develop a close growing relationship。
with Christ,。
then learn to put into spiritual practice。
the disciplines of,。
number one, living in the word,。
Bible study.。
Number two, praying in faith,。
prayer.。
Number three,。
fellowshipping with believers,。
faithful, consistent, regular attendance。
in God's church,。
even if it's online.。
And lastly,。
witnessing to the world,。
sharing your faith with others.。
I want to give you a word of warning,。
however.。
As important as these activities may be,。
they are not what Jesus says。
makes you a Christian.。
You can read the Bible from cover to cover.。
You can go to church every week。
for the rest of your life,。
and it won't guarantee。
a healthy relationship with God.。
Jesus is open in words。
to his disciples with ease.。
Follow me.。
He described as Christian。
people when he said,。
my people recognize my voice.。
I know them,。
and they follow.。
The essence of being a Christian for Jesus。
was to hear and to heed the voice of God.。
The process involved。
taking up your own cross,。
denying yourself,。
and losing your life。
in order to find it.。
I've got a new word for you.。
Followship.。
The process of followship。
didn't look the same for everyone.。
What Jesus said to the apostle Peter。
was different from what he said。
to the apostle John.。
But as the disciples。
responded to Jesus' word,。
they got to know God。
and his kingdom ways.。
The key to your growth。
is to get to know God。
and his kingdom ways.。
And I want to pray for you right now.。
Before I pray for you,。
I do realize that there might be。
people watching。
for whom measuring。
your spiritual discipline。
cannot be done.。
Just as I cannot measure。
my fitness levels without。
my steps without a Fitbit。
or a smartphone,。
you cannot begin to measure。
your spiritual fitness。
without being attached。
to the true vine,。
Jesus Christ.。
You don't have yet。
a personal relationship。
with Jesus Christ.。
He is not your Lord and Savior.。
Yet.。
I say yet.。
I want to challenge you.。
You need to come before the cross.。
The cross that you see on the slide.。
Look at it.。
Confess the things that you've done wrong。
and your need for forgiveness.。
Receive him.。
And choose to follow him.。
Can I ask everyone,。
wherever you are,。
just to close your eyes for a moment.。
And I want to give anybody。
who's watching online。
that opportunity。
to come to the cross,。
to confess your sins,。
to ask for forgiveness。
and ask Jesus。
to become your personal Savior.。
I'm not talking about your friend here,。
your brother or your sister.。
I'm talking about you.。
If you haven't taken that step yet,。
would you pray this prayer with me?。
Dear Heavenly Father,。
I come before you now。
and I recognize。
my need of your Son, Jesus Christ.。
I believe Jesus Christ.。
You went to the cross for me。
and you died for my sins.。
I confess.。
I have done things wrong.。
In thought, word and deed.。
I need your forgiveness.。
Today, I come to your cross.。
I ask for your forgiveness.。
I ask you to come into my life。
and fill me with your Spirit.。
Lord Jesus,。
I receive your free gift of eternal life.。
I am yours。
and I will be。
forever and ever.。
Amen.。
And if you prayed that prayer,。
please tell someone.。
Either go on the chat line。
or tell your Explorers leaders.。
Tell someone that you prayed this prayer.。
I'm not finished yet.。
I want to pray for all of us.。
This area of spiritual growth is not an easy area.。
We're all faced with the compromises of the world.。
We're faced at the moment with COVID.。
Before that, we were faced with the political situation.。
It is not easy。
to grow as a Christian.。
I want to pray for you now.。
I want you to go back on this talk.。
Maybe listen to it again.。
Take down the notes from the slides.。
I'll ask Carmen and leaders to send you copies of the slides.。
And I want to pray for you。
that you would grow as a believer.。
Let's all pray together.。
Father God, I thank you for today.。
I thank you that you've shown us。
that Jesus is the true vine.。
We are the branches.。
And I thank you for these four ways。
that you've shown us to grow in Him.。
I pray, Lord, that you'd give us the discipline, the will.。
Lord, that you'd make the time available for us。
that maybe we turn off Netflix for a moment。
and look in your word, seek your face.。
And I pray, Lord, that you'd raise us up.。
Lord, not as believers, but as the true disciples.。
And I pray that everyone who is online this morning。
will grow into a true disciple of Jesus Christ.。
Amen.。
Thank you for listening to me.。
I hope it's not too long。
before I get a chance to speak to you again.。
God bless you, Explorers.。
