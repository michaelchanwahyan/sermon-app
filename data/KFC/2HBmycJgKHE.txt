Hi KFC, so awesome to be with you today. And today we're going to be talking。
about the King's resurrection. John last week did a great job of explaining to us。
the King's ransom. He went through Palm Sunday in which Jesus was celebrated as。
he went in and entered into Jerusalem. He talked about the Lord's Supper and。
shortly after that the King was betrayed by his own disciple. The King was then。
denied by his friend when he was in trial. The King was rejected by his。
people. Barnabas was chosen over this King. The King was stripped,。
beaten and mocked. And then on Good Friday the King was crucified. The King。
was crucified on the cross. And so the mood is very sad. The disciples。
dispersed like a sheep, like a shepherd, like sheep without a shepherd. They hid.。
But on that morning, Easter Sunday, the women came out. And we read in Matthew。
chapter 28, "After the Sabbath at dawn on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene。
and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. There was a violent earthquake for。
an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back。
the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning and his clothes were。
white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like。
dead men. The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid for I know that you are。
looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not here. He has risen just as he said.。
Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples he has。
risen from the dead and going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him。
now I have told you." We're going to talk about three things here today. The first。
thing that we notice is that the angel says, "He is risen. Jesus is king over。
death. Jesus is king over death." In these times, we've seen so much death. The latest。
tolls tallies are there is over 130,000 deaths because of this coronavirus.。
People are fearing death. People are afraid to die. But Jesus conquers over。
death. Jesus is the only person that has died and rose again.。
Muhammad the Prophet died and did not rise. Buddha died. Confucius died. But。
Jesus is the only one that died and rose again. He is the ultimate sacrifice for。
us. In the olden days, you know, in the Old Testament, they had to bring a lamb to。
sacrifice to represent their sin. But Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice. We no。
longer have to bring a sacrifice because Jesus died once and for all. And now we。
no longer have to fear death as well because Jesus has conquered death on the。
cross. The second thing we notice is that he is risen, that the King is king over。
life. Jesus is king over life. The virus makes us reflect upon life, what life。
really is about. Life is short. Life is so fragile. Life on earth is finite. We。
treasure the important things. We start to treasure the important things during。
these times. The family that we have, the friends that we've met, we start to。
question what is the purpose of our life, the goals that we have, and the。
accomplishments that we've made. The first thing that Jesus really proposes。
to us is that he came so that we could have life and have it to the fullest,。
have it abundantly. He says that in John chapter 10 verse 10. So many people are。
alive but yet do not truly live. Jesus is king of life. Jesus says, "What good is it。
for a man to gain the whole world, all the riches, yet forfeit his soul?。
Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?" Jesus is。
king over life, life to the fullest. And in John it also says that now this is。
eternal life, that we may know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have。
sent. Jesus is not only king over this life, but eternal life, the eternal life.。
If we know Jesus Christ, we have eternal life. And the last thing it says, the。
angel said, "He is risen just as he said, just as he said." Jesus is the king of。
truth. His words are truth. Jesus claimed that in three days he would rise, tear。
down the temple, and in three days I will raise it again, that he would go away for。
a little while and then he will appear again. He is the truth. His words are。
truth. They tried to even suppress this truth, right? They, Rome tried to put Roman。
guards to have a Roman seal of this tomb so that nobody could get this body, so。
that Jesus' words would not be true. But yet the angel came and opened the tomb。
and Jesus rose from the dead. The Jews also tried to suppress the truth. They。
paid the soldiers to say the disciples came and stole the body. But we know that。
the testimony of the disciples is that Jesus rose, he appeared and rose from the。
dead. Jesus also fulfills more than 300 prophecies in the Old Testament. His。
birth, his life, his miracles, the suffering that he had, the death, and his。
resurrection was all prophesied in the Old Testament, and it has become true. He。
is the promise, the promise fulfilled as it was written in the Old Testament. So。
Jesus is king over death. He is our ultimate sacrifice. Jesus is the king of。
life. He is our Messiah. Jesus is king of truth. He is the promise, the promise。
fulfilled. We're gonna continue to read verse 8 to 10. So the women hurried away。
from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly。
Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, collapsed at their feet, and。
worshipped him. Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go。
to Galilee. There they will see me." Jesus met these women, and what happened? They。
collapsed at his feet and worshipped him. Muhammad was never worshipped, right?。
Muhammad was never worshipped. He just said, you know, "I am a prophet."。
Confucius was never worshipped. He never claimed that he was God, but Jesus。
claimed that he is the I Am. He is the Messiah. He is the Alpha and the Omega,。
the second person of the Trinity. He was there in creation. All things were made。
in and through him. Jesus accepted this worship. He didn't say, "Oh no, don't。
worship me." No, he accepted this worship as they collapsed at their feet and。
worshipped him. He is the Lord. He is our God. This is the King of the universe.。
Jesus is King of our universe. And lastly, we see that Jesus is a personal King.。
Usually kings are in their castles. They're protected by their secret。
security, but no, this King is a personal King. In the passage earlier, we saw that。
the angel instructed the woman to go tell the disciples that he's gonna come。
to them. Jesus himself says, "Tell my brothers in Galilee. There they will see。
me." Jesus was in the tomb for three days, and the first thing he wanted to do when。
he came out of the tomb was to see his people, to see his disciples. He could。
have gone for a nice steak or another Passover dinner. No, no, he didn't do that.。
He wanted to go to see his people, and we know that Jesus appeared to more than。
500 people, his disciples and over 500 people, and that is one of the reasons we。
know that Jesus did rise from the dead because of the testimony of these。
disciples, and later their changed lives, that they were willing to die for this。
truth, even to death on the cross. Some of them martyrs as well, right? Peter。
upside down on the cross. So Jesus is our personal King. He is a King that。
understands the things that we've gone through. In Hebrews, it says that we have。
a high priest who is able to empathize with our weaknesses. He understands the。
things that we've gone through, yet he has overcome those things. Jesus is also a。
personal King that wants to know each one of you. He says in Revelation chapter。
3 verse 20, "Here I stand. I stand at the door and knock. If anyone opens, hears my。
voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person and they with。
me." Jesus wants to be in your life. Are you willing to open the door of your。
heart to let Jesus in to your life, to be your Lord and Savior? So today we talked。
about five things. That Jesus is King over death. He is our ultimate sacrifice.。
He is the bridge that allows us to be restored with the Lord. He is the wrath。
of God was taken upon him. He is the King of life. He allows us to live life to the。
fullest and abundantly. He is eternal life. If we know Jesus Christ, we have。
eternal life. He is our Messiah. Jesus is King of truth. Every word he says is true.。
He is our promise, the promises that were fulfilled in the Old Testament. He is the。
King of the universe, the women worshipped at his feet. He is our God.。
And lastly, he's a personal King. He's a King that understands the things that。
we've gone through. He is our High Priest and he wants to be the King over your。
life. Is Jesus King in your life? Is Jesus King in your life? I think as I've grown。
up throughout the teenage years, I've started to logically understand more and。
more that all the religions of the world teach that you can do something, right? In。
Islam, you have to pray five times a day. You have to go to the pilgrimage,。
you know, in order for Allah to accept you. In Hinduism, you got to, you know,。
worship all these gods and fulfill all their things so that they will save you.。
But only in Christianity is it that we cannot save ourselves, that we need a。
Savior. We need Jesus Christ. And I logically began to understand that more。
and more. And when I understood that logically, Jesus became the King over my。
life. Recently, my friend, you know, just became more and more serious about。
Jesus. And as he was having dinner with his father, his father was like, "This is。
the golden age of your life. You're in your 30s. Now is the time to make money。
and prosper." And he's like, "I now have a new perspective of life." This new。
perspective is that life is more than just this world. There is eternal life.。
Jesus has become King over his life. And now I'm going to invite Paul, and he's。
going to share a little bit about how Jesus has become King over his own life.。
So Jesus being King over my personal life has really been something that's。
been happening over time as he's been weeding out different aspects. But one。
clear moment to me in my life was really when I was 18, and God was。
really talking to me about taking my faith more seriously. And part of that。
was actually just giving up getting drunk and going out drinking. And at。
that time, it was really difficult for me. It didn't even make sense.。
It was something I could hide my insecurities behind, such as, you know, fear of not。
being able to relate to people. And even as a Christian, then I just found it hard。
to reconcile that and make sense of it. But it was what I needed to do, and so I。
had to do it. And then from reflecting, at that time I was allowing。
drinking to actually guide my actions and my thoughts more than what I。
was allowing God to, and allowing Jesus to. And so I was actually giving that。
drinking more authority than I was giving Jesus. So that authority needed to。
go back, whether or not it made sense to me at that time. And so I'm not sure if。
that's the most significant, but it was definitely the most significant to me in。
feeling, as it was quite difficult. And since then, really, it's just。
been a process of God showing different areas to me where I need to hand that。
authority back to Him, whether that's how I spend my time, the words that come。
out of my mouth, and just different areas like that where I've。
wanted to have my own rule, and just on each of those areas God's pressed me。
just to allow Him to be king in that. Thanks so much, Paul. And I'm hoping。
today that if you have not allowed Jesus to be in your life, to be king over your。
life, that you can make a decision today. And I would love to pray with you, and。
you can make this decision as we pray to God. Prayer is our communication with God.。
God is not as concerned with the words of your mouth as He is with the attitude。
of your heart. And so if you would like to invite Jesus to be king over your。
life, we can pray now. Pray with me. Dear Father, we thank you for Jesus Christ and。
what He did on the cross, His death and His resurrection. And in three days He。
proved that He is king over death, He's king over life, He is king of truth, the。
king of this universe, our God, and He is a personal king. And now, Lord, I want to。
invite you into my life to be my Lord and Savior. Would you come into my life。
and make me the person you want me to be. Forgive me of my sins. In Christ's name I。
pray. Amen.。
Bless you, KFC. And I pray that, Lord, you would take this message of our Lord's。
resurrection to your friends and your family as well. God bless you.。
