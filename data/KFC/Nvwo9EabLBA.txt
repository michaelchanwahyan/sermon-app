One of the people that we're praying for at the moment is the Prime Minister of Britain.。
I'm reminded of a comment made by a former Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, who said, "A。
week is a long time in politics."。
I think we could safely say that a week in 2020 is also a long time.。
In some countries around the world, just this last week, the number of cases, the death。
toll has actually doubled inside that week.。
Even this week in Hong Kong, I mean, restrictions have been placed.。
For example, Johnny can't go to the pub anymore.。
James can't play mahjong anymore.。
Bonnie can't go karaoke.。
And you know, I could go downstairs and order a Big Mac and large fries at five to six in。
the evening, but not get one at five past six.。
We are studying Matthew's Gospel and have entitled our series, "Jesus is King."。
25%, one quarter of Matthew's Gospel is devoted to the last week of Jesus' life.。
That's the last 0.05% of Jesus' life.。
We see, don't we, on one hand, the crowd shouting, "Hosanna!。
Jesus is King!。
Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!"。
Days later, the crowd shouting, "Crucify!。
Crucify Him!"。
In a few days, the mood has changed.。
Gone from celebration to apparent defeat.。
The so-called Savior, Messiah, the King, dead on the cross.。
The sign above His head mocking Him, Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.。
It seems that even those who crucified Him have been listening to our sermon series.。
I guess that's a little how our city feels after the social unrest followed quickly by。
the virus.。
But we know it is not the end.。
I love the book by Tony Campolo.。
It's Friday, but Sunday's coming.。
We meet today not as a people defeated, but as one poised for victory.。
Johnny will be back next week to talk to us about the resurrection.。
We are looking forward to Easter Sunday and weeks after that to Pentecost, to the coming。
of the Holy Spirit.。
And we have a choice.。
We can stay here, and I'm not undermining our serious situation, or we can prepare for。
resurrection and we can prepare for a fresh wave of the Holy Spirit.。
It's a dilemma having a Saturday service.。
I always wonder at Easter whether we're actually having a Good Friday service or an Easter。
Sunday service, or maybe a bit of both.。
We call this week before Easter Holy Week because it was originally the time of the。
Feast of Passover when the Jews were saved in Egypt.。
And because of the miraculous things that Jesus did in the last week of his life.。
During Holy Week, we wave palms in the air and hail Jesus as King, the long-awaited Messiah。
who's going to save us.。
Then we change our minds and scream that the Romans should crucify him.。
We share a loving Last Supper and he washes our feet.。
Then we sneak out after dinner and we betray him.。
Jesus begs us to stay with him.。
We promise we will.。
Then we don't.。
We abandon him.。
He's arrested and beaten.。
He forgives us and then we run away.。
Then Jesus is killed.。
We lay him in a tomb and weep.。
We go back for him.。
Then he's gone.。
Now he's back.。
Then wait, he's not dead at all.。
We witness to Christ in song and story throughout Holy Week.。
On Palm Sunday, normal times process with palms and songs.。
We celebrate Jesus triumphantly riding into Jerusalem on the back of a donkey.。
Men and women line the streets yelling, "Hosanna!" and waving palm branches.。
They were greeting the Messiah who they believe had come to save us.。
Let's hear James read that account to us.。
The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.。
They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on.。
A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road while others cut branches from the。
trees and spread them on the road.。
The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, "Hosanna to the son。
of David!。
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.。
Hosanna in the highest!"。
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"。
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."。
We can be like that crowd.。
There were the Christians in church at weekend singing praise songs, hands lifted high in。
worship.。
I love the song by Matt Redmond, "Blessed Be Your Name."。
He actually wrote this after 9/11 in 2001.。
He says, "Look, when the sun is shining down on me and the world and all it should be,。
blessed be your name."。
But then he said, "When there's pain in the offering, on the road marked with suffering,。
blessed be your name."。
On Holy Monday, we remember Jesus throwing out all the money changers and vendors from。
the temple.。
Now, the temple in Jerusalem was a place of worship.。
It was the center of worship for the Jews, and they were required to present money and。
animals for sacrifice to the priests when they visited.。
Johnny is going to read this now to us.。
Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there.。
He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.。
It is written, he said to them, "My house will be called a house of prayer, but you。
are making it a den of robbers."。
Animal vendors and money changers had set up booths in the court.。
People believed that God actually lived in the most holy of holy places, the inner sanctum。
of the temple.。
The desecration angered Jesus so much that he turned over the tables of the money changers。
and ran all the animal vendors out.。
Now before we start asking, "How dare they?"。
We have to ask ourselves, "Are the same hands that are lifted in worship at the weekend。
involved in something in the office on Monday that we should be ashamed of?"。
Something underhand, stabbing a colleague in the back, gossiping.。
This is the weekend.。
Let's search ourselves.。
If we find that we are a little too much like the money changers, get on our knees before。
the King and ask him to forgive.。
On Holy Tuesday, Jesus spent most of the day at the Mount of Olives, on the Mount of Olives。
where he preached.。
Our team was there in June last year.。
There's a picture on the screen.。
We get the parables of the kingdom.。
James spoke to us last week about the parables of Jesus.。
He was telling the crowds what the kingdom would be like and how we could join him.。
The parables of the two sons, the tenants, the wedding banquet, the ten virgins, the。
talents, the sheep and the goats are quoted in these chapters.。
I wonder if we have fully embraced Jesus as King and understand what kingdom living actually。
is.。
On what is strangely called Spy Wednesday, we remember Judas Iscariot, a zealot who thought。
he was doing the right thing by agreeing to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.。
He thought that if Jesus was jailed, the people would rise up and overthrow the Romans.。
Let's hear this from Paul.。
Then one of the twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priest and asked,。
what are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?。
So they counted out for him 30 pieces of silver.。
From then on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.。
On what is called Maundy Thursday, Jesus shared a common meal with his disciples.。
We call this the Eucharist or the Holy Communion.。
Many churches around the world strip their altars and cover any icons or statues on Maundy。
Thursday in preparation for the morning of Jesus' crucifixion on Good Friday.。
There will be no celebration of communion until the resurrection.。
Many other churches hold feet washings, washing each other's feet to commemorate that Jesus。
washed the feet of his disciples.。
I'm sharing with you now a precious photo.。
This was actually my last day as senior pastor of the Vine Church.。
You'll see in this picture that Sandra and I were having our feet washed by Andrew and。
Chris Gardner, who were just about to take over as senior pastors.。
This was one of the most memorable times of my whole life.。
But Jesus reminds us that we're to love each other as he loved us.。
We are to metaphorically wash each other's feet.。
He equips his army, not with a sword, but with a bowl and a towel.。
Who is he calling you to minister to this Easter weekend?。
Let's read the story of the Last Supper from Florence.。
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it。
and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat.。
This is my body."。
Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink。
from it, all of you.。
This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of。
sins.。
I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until the day when。
I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."。
When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.。
After the meal, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray.。
He asked the disciples to stay and pray with him, but they all fall asleep.。
Jesus is left to pray for strength for what is to come by himself, abandoned by his own。
disciples.。
Judas then identified Jesus to the Roman guards with a kiss, and he was taken away by the。
soldiers.。
Now we are not entirely sure why this Friday got the name of Good Friday.。
It certainly wasn't a good day.。
Jesus was brought here before Pilate, the Roman governor, and sentenced to death.。
He was then forced to walk the hill of Golgotha, carrying the cross to which he would be crucified.。
There was a commemoration of this walk called the Stations of the Cross, which participants。
remember each of the steps of the crucifixion.。
Our team did that on the Via Della Rosa.。
Bonnie is going to read this account to us.。
From noon until three in the afternoon, darkness came over all the land.。
About three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"。
which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"。
When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."。
Immediately, one of them ran and got a sponge.。
He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.。
The rest said, "Now leave him alone.。
Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."。
And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.。
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.。
It doesn't sound very good.。
Good Friday is good because Christ showed his great love for man and purchased for him。
every blessing.。
If you've accepted his love, it's good news indeed.。
If you've rejected his love, it's bad news.。
Worse than any virus, Jesus' body was taken down from the cross and buried in an unused。
tomb.。
Holy Saturday ends the season of Lent, for Easter Sunday will be a celebration of new。
life.。
Holy Saturday is a day of waiting for the resurrection on Easter Sunday.。
Let's hear it.。
The next day, the one after preparation day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to。
Pilate.。
"Sir," they said.。
We remember that while he was still alive, that deceiver said, "After three days, I will。
rise again."。
So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day.。
Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been。
raised from the dead.。
This last deception will be worse than the first.。
"Take a guard," Pilate answered.。
"Go make the tombs as secure as you know how."。
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.。
And so we leave it, the king dead.。
The tomb with guards and a heavy stone.。
I'm going to give you a spoiler alert now.。
Jesus did not stay dead.。
He did not stay in the tomb.。
He is risen.。
And next week, Pastor Johnny is going to talk all about the resurrection.。
But what about us?。
We can pause and reflect.。
Think about each of the days of Holy Week and what preparation you can make to be ready。
for the festive celebration and the resurrection of Jesus on Easter Sunday.。
I'm going to invite our worship team back now.。
We're going to sing this wonderful old hymn, "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross."。
I want you, perhaps not so much to sing it, but to reflect on the words.。
And let this be your Holy Week meditation.。
