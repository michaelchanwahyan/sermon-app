Good morning, everyone.。
I'm so happy to be here today.。
This is KFC, right?。
Yes, and there are many young people here.。
Let me introduce myself first.。
I'm Hu Yu-yong, the founder of U4.。
Young people usually don't call themselves "Yong-ge".。
But if you're 25 or older,。
you can call yourself "Yong".。
We're all the same age.。
So I want to hear...。
Because I can't see your faces clearly under the light.。
I want to know who is "Yong" and who is "Yong-ge".。
I want to know where you are.。
I'll count to three, and you can call my name.。
I'll know where you are.。
One, two, three.。
This side is "Yong-ge".。
I often go to different schools,。
different churches,。
and different jobs.。
We have a space in our workplace.。
We have a space here.。
Last time, a team of witnesses came to visit us.。
It just so happens to be called "The World".。
So when I saw "Come to The World",。
I felt very familiar.。
It's like welcoming me.。
I can continue to bring the water of life to the world.。
Here, everyone can meet Jesus.。
It's like a paradise.。
Today's topic is called "The New Fire".。
My original topic was a bit of a joke.。
The "New" in "New Fire" is what we originally called "New Fire Youth Network".。
People usually call it "U4".。
U4 has a special feature, which is "fast".。
So I talk very fast.。
Can you keep up with me?。
I want to cooperate with everyone.。
I don't need to be so sincere.。
So I'm very sincere.。
I speed up my speech.。
And I have limited time.。
I'll talk faster.。
U4 has two core values.。
First, we want to talk about networks.。
Through different bridges,。
we can connect to many different schools,。
churches,。
and workplaces,。
and different institutions.。
It's like a four-wheel drive.。
It's fast.。
It's fast on the highway.。
And we also talk about generation.。
Generation is the generation of the New Fire.。
So the "New" in "New Fire Youth Network"。
is a bit of a joke.。
It's the wood under the three fires.。
Many people expect the youth to be useless.。
But when the fire is lit in the church,。
it's like Moses.。
Even if he has a lot of sadness,。
when the fire is lit,。
he will find his fire, his life, and his life again in the church.。
He has a destiny.。
So we hope that the youth can be like this fire.。
The logo of the fire is like the fire of the Holy Spirit.。
It's lit.。
And then you think of the four fires.。
Because the New Fire is also a big fire.。
One big fire and three small fires.。
It's like Daniel and his three friends.。
In the Babylonian system,。
they are still standing for God.。
When they were young,。
when they were studying,。
they were still standing for God.。
They died, but they still have confidence.。
They are not afraid to go into the fire.。
We hope that our youth will continue to burn the love of God.。
This is our goal.。
So we have to cross generations, cross regions,。
cross schools, cross borders to go together.。
It's been 25 years.。
There were a lot of celebrations yesterday.。
I will continue to watch.。
It's better to watch the video.。
Let's watch a short video.。
Music, please.。
(upbeat music)。
(upbeat music)。
(upbeat music)。
(upbeat music)。
(upbeat music)。
(upbeat music)。
(upbeat music)。
Okay, we've watched the video for only one minute.。
I don't know how you feel after watching it.。
I want you to interview me later.。
I don't want to be on the stage.。
I will walk down the stage later.。
I will interview you.。
After watching the video,。
what did you see?。
What are the characteristics?。
Do you have any DNA?。
I will give you about 15 seconds。
to talk to the people next to you.。
I will see who didn't say anything.。
I will find those people.。
Okay, 15 seconds.。
Start talking.。
What did you see in this video?。
What atmosphere?。
How do you feel?。
Okay.。
I will give you a little time to talk.。
I will give you a little interaction time.。
Okay.。
Five seconds left.。
Five, four, three, two, one.。
Okay, time's up.。
Okay, I see a couple.。
Yes, they are holding hands to talk.。
I think they are close.。
Okay, let's interview the previous generation.。
We are a cross-generation, right?。
Okay, what do you think?。
We think it's very energetic.。
Very energetic?。
Yes.。
What about you?。
I want to ask you if you think the video is fast.。
Okay, because it's energetic.。
Wow, give him a big round of applause.。
Let's interview you.。
How do you feel about the video?。
Very fast.。
Yes.。
I can hear it.。
I can hear it.。
I can hear it.。
What about you?。
Same.。
You are all wearing the same clothes.。
Keep watching his hoodie.。
You know, when I go to many places to broadcast,。
especially the previous generation,。
they say, "Why are you so fast? We can't catch up."。
When I first saw this video,。
I asked my colleagues in the media department。
if they should slow down.。
They said, "Brother Yong, you are fast."。
"You are fast."。
"If you don't speed up, people will be confused."。
"It's the same."。
So, it's not about what you see,。
but what you feel.。
This is an era of sensibility.。
So, they feel energetic,。
and there are many things to interact with.。
It's like they want to participate.。
This is the atmosphere.。
People will stop watching after a minute.。
You can think of it as an ad.。
It's good.。
So, the previous generation。
would slow down。
and the next generation would think,。
"No, you can't catch up."。
So, the speed of the two generations is different.。
Our expressions are different.。
We have many adjustments.。
So, I'm willing to go with the young.。
So, you go out.。
We'll go in the middle.。
Why is this?。
It's not this.。
Why is this?。
Okay.。
It's an ad for the video.。
Sorry.。
Okay.。
Let's keep watching.。
Today, I want to talk about。
"The Legend of the Three-Line Poetry."。
Let's read this sentence together.。
One, two, three.。
"The day of the great and great is yet to come.。
I will not be able to see the day before.。
Where are you going?。
The heart of a father must turn to his daughter,。
and the heart of a daughter to her father,。
lest I should come and help the land."。
This is Malachi 4, 5-6.。
It's also the last verse。
in the Old Testament.。
This is a very important message。
in the Bible.。
Since we need to talk about the meaning behind the message,。
we need to talk about the background of the Malachi 4.。
It's a big era.。
There are many internal and external troubles.。
In the middle,。
the people who were exiled and then returned。
started to rebuild the temple.。
There were many internal moral problems.。
They started to fail.。
There were many religious problems in the society.。
Everyone couldn't stand it.。
But there were many complaints.。
The Jews experienced external difficulties.。
The pressure from the outside world and the economic situation。
caused many disturbances.。
So they thought, "Why would God make me come here?。
Why would God make me come here。
when I was watching the injustice?。
Many people used their self-centeredness to talk to God.。
In the political world,。
in the Persian dynasty,。
in the ruling environment,。
everyone was unstable.。
The policy changed at any time.。
It's like in this era,。
the international situation is suddenly...。
In the international affairs,。
the country must attack the people.。
Even if it's not just a fire,。
there are many economic conflicts.。
In the era of AI,。
everyone is very nervous.。
We are living in a big era.。
In the middle,。
you can see the importance of God.。
When facing many questions,。
He chooses to be patient。
and constantly talk to His people.。
He constantly tries to solve the problems。
and solve the knots in their hearts.。
At the same time, He gives some instructions。
and even teaches them.。
We can see the need for spiritual restoration.。
We need to return to the temple.。
So in the Bible,。
we need to turn our father's heart。
into our daughter's heart。
and our daughter's heart into our father's heart.。
There are two meanings.。
Father means God.。
We need to return to God.。
As God's daughter,。
God's children,。
we need to return to God's original law.。
He said it earlier.。
In the Bible,。
"When you abandon me,。
when you leave the teaching,。
you will be saved."。
That's the meaning.。
And there is a second meaning.。
We need to choose to be with our parents.。
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob。
were the herdsmen in the middle.。
David was the herdsman。
when he was built in the middle of the kingdom.。
We need to be with our parents.。
We need to return to God.。
How did they follow God?。
That's the root.。
We need to return to God.。
So that we won't be in the middle of the crowd.。
So this is a call to the heart.。
And then,。
there is the old covenant.。
It's also the situation of the new covenant.。
There is a man named John the Baptist.。
He was described as Elijah.。
And in the Old Covenant,。
he was following Jesus.。
Jesus didn't say anything for 400-500 years.。
He didn't speak the word of God.。
He was very dry inside.。
So he wanted to see if there was any inspiration.。
If there was anyone who could lead us。
to leave the wilderness.。
And who was Elijah in the wilderness?。
Many times,。
the Old Covenant describes him like this.。
He must have the heart and ability of Elijah.。
He was walking in front of the Lord.。
He called for the heart to turn to the ears.。
He called for the people to turn to the ears.。
And he called for the people to be ready to be with him.。
To be ready for Jesus to come again.。
To come to the middle of us.。
So this is also our call now.。
We need to use a king of kings,。
a king of kings,。
a king of kings,。
in every chapter.。
We need to be ready for this path.。
We are all called to be the voice of the wilderness.。
Whether it's the New Testament,。
or the New Testament,。
or the New Testament,。
we are all called to be the voice of the wilderness.。
God is also very wonderful in the middle.。
He is the one who puts Elijah and the Lord together.。
God's words and Elijah's work are like Elijah's work.。
The clothes he wears are similar to Elijah's.。
So when people see a crazy man talking,。
it's like they know each other.。
It's like there are people like this in the middle.。
So they are called to the wilderness very quickly.。
There was no WhatsApp or Instagram.。
Why did people go to the wilderness so quickly?。
Because some people look familiar.。
Is it him?。
So everyone is in the wilderness,。
in the wilderness,。
people are everywhere.。
And then line up in the church。
to be baptized by him.。
This is the background of the time.。
Everyone is learning.。
Everyone is not in the middle.。
There is already a place in the middle.。
There is no hope.。
So we have found that in the past few years,。
Hong Kong has not been able to dream.。
We need God to lead us,。
help us,。
and know how to leave the seat of the devil.。
But it's clear that。
if the heart of the Father and the heart of Elijah are not aligned,。
we will not be able to align the heart of God,。
and we will not be able to go back to the people of the past,。
the people of different generations,。
even when we established this church,。
our predecessors,。
our previous generation,。
it is very difficult for us to be aligned in the middle,。
and continue to survive the industries that our previous generation gave us.。
And the Hong Kong Church,。
facing the impact of these ten years and eight years,。
we have to face the reality that the faith generation has left a lot.。
From the age of ten to thirty,。
we rarely see this picture.。
I often go to different churches,。
do you know that more than half of the churches。
only have ten or eight members?。
Some of the believers,。
about one-fourth,。
have to start over,。
start over from elementary school,。
from the faith generation.。
The group of more than 100 people is very large.。
You are a large youth church.。
Many churches are very square,。
the believers are left behind by faith,。
and by the wood,。
even the leaders and the leaders of the wood-raising youth have left.。
Many of my friends have left,。
because they have been walking in the江湖 for so long,。
and have met many different youth pastors.。
They have no choice,。
because their children are very young,。
so they have the opportunity to think about what to do next.。
And you see the immigration era,。
the unemployment era,。
the political situation is unstable,。
the pandemic has a lot of impact.。
We have started to disconnect,。
and there is a big gap between people.。
I don't know if you have communicated,。
it has been a few years,。
people are beginning to feel that communication is an obstacle,。
there is a social fear,。
many times they wear masks and are afraid to see people.。
This is the state we have to face in this era,。
this state of challenge.。
And what will happen to Hong Kong?。
Many young people,。
even those with a degree,。
have chosen to jump into the church.。
Last week, I had a chat with a principal,。
he said the school was under a lot of pressure,。
and was very nervous.。
Suddenly, a person disappeared in the classroom,。
and everyone was looking for him,。
and they were all fighting,。
but they couldn't find him.。
Who knew he went to the toilet to poop?。
The disappearance of the principal for 10 minutes,。
shocked the whole school.。
But what was the feeling?。
Very alert,。
very sensitive.。
Some teachers in the school are very stressed,。
recently, a girl was cutting her hand in the classroom,。
and she had to deal with the blood.。
She went home every day,。
and she repeated this scene when she was sleeping.。
She was the only one who was helpless.。
I want to say,。
it's not just the students who are stressed,。
but also the teachers.。
Many of them jumped up,。
and wanted to pull her closer.。
Those in the first year of the class,。
they were under a lot of pressure,。
and there were a lot of comparisons.。
Even if I was in the top 10,。
I felt very unsatisfied,。
and I was not good enough.。
But in the second and third year,。
there were a lot of SENs,。
and a lot of families broke up.。
We found that the whole school,。
the next generation,。
was facing a big impact.。
I don't know if you feel the same way.。
A lot of comparisons,。
a lot of differences,。
a lot of competition,。
which made us feel lost.。
How do we solve this problem?。
We see that。
everyone has different opinions.。
So when there are a lot of disputes,。
we are disconnected.。
And death is a total disconnect.。
So I don't know if you feel a lot of pressure.。
We have a lot of contradictions in our generation.。
One of them is the point of view.。
A lot of opinions are different,。
a lot of opinions are mixed.。
It depends on the situation.。
It depends on how we look at the situation.。
Whether we support Islam or not,。
we have a long time to argue.。
So we often。
stand in such contradictions.。
One day, the Buddha asked me to look at this picture.。
He said, "Do you know what number this is?"。
"What is it?"。
"Well, it's a little bigger here."。
"This is nine. I'm nine.。
I eat more salt than you eat rice."。
"No, I'm six."。
"I see this,。
I have a different view."。
Everyone wants everyone to stand opposite each other.。
And then the following is the conclusion.。
Why are people arguing?。
Because they don't stand in the opposite direction.。
Then, do you know?。
The Buddha told me,。
"Actually, most people look at it this way."。
"Do you know how to look at it from the perspective of the ascetic?"。
"What do you mean?"。
Sometimes, when I talk to the upper level,。
I have to think about it and reflect on it.。
When I went to the inner room to pray again,。
the Buddha said, "This is not a number."。
"It's not nine and six."。
"What is this word?"。
"On the side of nine,。
it's the G of small grass."。
"On the side of six, it's the G of large grass."。
"In fact, everyone is G."。
"Do you know that?"。
"Many times, we are G."。
So we have to look at it from the perspective of God.。
Thank you.。
Give me some applause.。
It's hard to get applause.。
Do you understand?。
I think they are very self-righteous.。
"Do you know that G is for God?"。
"G is for good."。
"Can we look at it from the perspective of God?"。
"Is it good to look at it from the perspective of the tree of life?"。
"Is it good to look at it from the perspective of God?"。
"Can we look at it from the perspective of Jesus?"。
"Where is Jesus?"。
"Jesus is next to you."。
"What do you do?"。
"We pray."。
"We can be one."。
His sacrifice is to take away the toxic root of the fruit of division and division of love.。
To restore our status of "sons and daughters."。
We each look at each other and give love to each other.。
So that people can recognize us as their disciples.。
So that we can give love to each other in our lives.。
To prevent many sins.。
Not to ignore the sins.。
It's that we cover each other in the middle.。
Even to accept.。
Then let him have a chance to return.。
Return to the heart of God.。
The church should be like this.。
So that there is a distinction.。
When the heart of God is cold.。
Matthew 24 says so.。
But there are people who distinguish between right and wrong.。
It should be like this.。
The church is not in the middle.。
Just you stab me, I stab you.。
Stabbing each other in the nose.。
It's not like that.。
It's to look at each other.。
So can we look at each other in both generations?。
Now it's starting.。
Many times, the tree of life is divided.。
It's you and me.。
I also told my parents.。
"You don't have a gift."。
"Don't peek at my things on Instagram."。
Many times, we don't want to look at each other.。
We don't want to see each other.。
We don't want to be seen by each other.。
If so,。
what is the situation of the righteous and the evil?。
When we want to share,。
when some people are looking at each other,。
we have lost the blessing and the cover of our previous generation.。
We see that in the Bible,。
the spirit of God is called the blood of the Father.。
I won't talk about this for a long time.。
But what I want to say is that。
you have to know that the spirit of God is a high-speed development in the Bible.。
Because everyone is AI.。
Everyone has a lot of knowledge.。
But there is no wisdom.。
And no experience in life.。
So it's too late to wait for him to drink the blood of the Father.。
You will have a spiritual leader when you have a little peace.。
Now your children need to speak.。
Your teenagers need to see the vision.。
Your seniors,。
in English, it means your seniors need to have a dream.。
This is the third generation.。
The younger children can be teenagers.。
Teenagers will let go of their vision.。
It's hard for seniors to keep having dreams.。
Seniors just wait to die.。
Many times it's like this.。
So can we put the three or four generations together?。
And what is the key?。
You call it mentors, right?。
It's you.。
We start at the age of twenty or thirty,。
and go to the age of fifty or sixty.。
This is your generation.。
Can you put so many people together?。
This is a family.。
At the end of the day,。
the hardest thing to do is our family.。
If our family is not well managed,。
if there is no good ecology,。
many times our children will be left behind.。
We can't let God's love and God's law。
lead them to the end, and they won't be deviated.。
So the enemy wants to destroy the family of the Holy Spirit.。
In the touch of the Holy Spirit,。
we can recognize that Jesus Christ is the Lord.。
In this scripture, it says。
we must keep the new life and the old life together,。
so that we can have the ability to resist,。
and the ability to expand God's kingdom.。
Then we can have more ability to fill the whole land.。
So we can be steady in the world.。
We see a lot of teenagers who have a lot of objections.。
And here is an example.。
This is my teenager.。
I want to show you the changes in his church.。
Let's welcome his pastor.。
We know that in the Bible,。
our parents' hearts are turned to our children.。
Our children's hearts are turned to our parents,。
so that God can help us.。
You see, in Hong Kong,。
there are many conflicts and conflicts in the cross-generation.。
It's like a rupture.。
So it makes us, in this city,。
full of many obstacles.。
So how can we turn the crisis into a turning point?。
Next to me is my teenager,。
his name is Zhu Yin.。
He wants to share with you。
how we can cross-generate the cross-generation。
and sell the things that God gives us.。
Zhu Yin, please.。
Okay, I want to share with you。
how I get along with my pastor.。
Actually, we first met five years ago.。
He came to our church.。
He just finished his theology.。
Before he studied theology, he was a teacher.。
So we young people don't like him very much.。
Because he has a teacher's personality.。
He has a long temper,。
a low-key and very strict personality.。
So we think that this pastor doesn't really care about us.。
He just wants to control us more.。
So we didn't like him very much at that time.。
But you guys seem to have been playing together since childhood.。
Yes, we started to get to know each other since we were in middle school.。
And then we grew up together.。
Actually, the church made us into eight young people.。
So the pastor and pastor also care about us a lot.。
He also helped you, right?。
Yes.。
So we thought that our pastor was a bit more strict.。
Why did he change?。
Actually, I have a very good relationship with him now.。
Why is there such a difference?。
I remember one year, I was invited by our pastor。
to join a camp called Holiness.。
It's a group of young people who want to be holy for God.。
But they can't get into the camp.。
Actually, I remember that time.。
The pastor told me a word.。
He said that the pastor who is now serving me is his own.。
If I don't believe in the person I can see and follow,。
how can I believe in the God I can't see?。
He is not very honest.。
It's like Yong Bo is sitting next to me now.。
I can see him, I can touch him.。
So this is a big reminder.。
Then I decided to reconcile my relationship with my pastor.。
I was very brave at that time.。
Not only me, but also my whole group had to reconcile with my pastor.。
I invited the ten or eight people who grew up with me。
to surround my pastor and say sorry to him.。
Wow, what did you do after saying sorry?。
Then I tried to convince him and try to be with him.。
The first thing I did with him was to serve him in school.。
Wow, that's amazing.。
Becoming his right-hand man.。
When he entered the school,。
he looked at a group of younger students.。
He thought, "Wow, these students are so much like themselves."。
They would still be stubborn, late, and not give in.。
That made me understand the heart of my pastor more.。
He treated us like that at that time.。
He was also tolerant and believed that we could grow up。
and we could make a big progress.。
My pastor continued to love us.。
He continued to tolerate us in our congregation.。
That made me understand his heart more.。
My pastor also made me understand the heart of a father and a mother.。
When the two of you reconciled and turned to your pastor,。
we saw that you had already entered the school.。
You could lead the students,。
and you led the students with the pastor.。
How many people are there in your church from the eight to now?。
There are 40 to 50 people who are now in the church.。
40 to 50 people! That's a big growth!。
It's not easy to see such a growth in this period of time.。
It must be a blessing from God.。
And the students who are in the school。
should be about 100 people.。
So when they went to serve with the pastors,。
there were already more than 10 college students who were in the same group.。
So we really want to see the intergenerational connection。
and the restoration.。
Blessings to the church and to our city.。
Blessings to everyone!。
Okay, so, Ju-Yen has already become a pastor.。
She has already been nursing more than 30 teenagers。
in her own small group.。
You can see that when we went up there,。
we took her away from the security area.。
This is a military camp.。
But the real battlefield is actually。
a place where people are killed in a row.。
We saw that the school was a heavy area.。
Many times, it was getting more and more crowded.。
People were very cold.。
Everyone was under great pressure.。
And when these young people were in the church,。
they were very comfortable.。
But when they went to school with us,。
and we did this prayer-learning program,。
we let them know how to turn the tide.。
In the past 11 years,。
we have brought a lot of college students,。
500 college students from different churches,。
to these schools,。
and we did a one-on-four training.。
We did it twice a week,。
and there was a tuition fee.。
And then they took their shirts in the middle,。
and then went to serve.。
Most importantly,。
the prayers were very sincere.。
Every day, every time they went in,。
it affected them.。
I remember that there was a group of people。
who went to a Buddhist school.。
All of us who went to school。
had no religious background.。
There were six boys.。
He said that a lot of servicemen。
were taken by the girls in the church.。
So they really wanted to do something.。
They really wanted the church to be a good place.。
So they knew that this plan was recommended by everyone,。
so they came.。
After they came,。
they went in with me on the first day.。
And then we walked around the school,。
and before we went into the classroom,。
we passed the main hall.。
In the main hall,。
there was a Buddha altar.。
The whole hall was this tall.。
He said that he had never seen a Buddha altar in a school.。
"Hey, Yong-ge, there's a long light."。
"I found a wood-burning room."。
They called it the "host room."。
"You didn't know?"。
That's how the Buddhist school was.。
The priest tried to shave his head for seven days.。
The priest went to Changzhou.。
You went to Canberra.。
He said that there was a Buddha festival in the middle.。
So don't not know.。
There are a lot of situations like this.。
So they said, "Can we go earlier?"。
"Let's go to the altar 15 minutes earlier."。
And then they prayed.。
Because I felt that。
these people had never heard the Buddha's voice.。
It was very difficult.。
Many times, when we bring university students。
from the military camp to the battlefield,。
their eyes open.。
Although they may be a little bit of a bully,。
but when they face the three of them,。
they can't do anything.。
Now there are a lot of obvious symptoms.。
And usually those who can't keep up with the progress of learning。
are the basic students.。
No money, no resources.。
They are like a base,。
a base,。
being trampled on.。
The teachers at school can't take care of them.。
And then they are abandoned in the middle.。
And then there is a vicious cycle.。
Confidence,。
interpersonal relationships,。
often go down.。
There are really a lot of emotional situations.。
When these people are in the military camp,。
when they go to the battlefield,。
they are calm.。
Because when it comes to actual situations,。
when they respond,。
we don't have any equipment.。
So when you are in this cold room,。
when you try to fight with us,。
you know what you are up to.。
Do you have a familiar military uniform?。
Do you know how to face the situation in the Senior Campus?。
Almost half of our contact is in the Senior Campus.。
And a lot of Band 3D is one third.。
How do we train them?。
How do we teach them how to learn and motivate?。
We are not just training to make them feel better.。
We really want to see them make a new breakthrough.。
We see that in the past,。
this plan has attracted a lot of parents,。
teachers,。
college students,。
and also a lot of middle school students.。
Their witnesses are evaluated highly.。
The teachers in the Buddhist schools have been with me for 10 years.。
Although they know I have a background in Christianity,。
I still go.。
In the Taoist schools, we go.。
In the Catholic schools, we go.。
In the Catholic schools, we go.。
In short, we go in without permission.。
There is a school that gives us from 30 to 100 people.。
Because there is a great need for harmony.。
We see that in the darkness,。
we are the only ones who have the light。
and the power to make a difference.。
Do we have our identity?。
Do we know that we are chosen to be a priest,。
a military instructor,。
a saint,。
and a holy finger?。
So after we have regained our identity,。
we try to go to the darkest areas.。
It is too easy to worship and praise here.。
Try it.。
Go to a hall。
and worship and praise together.。
The people below will be very confused.。
Can you still be able to praise?。
I am very grateful to my team.。
I even preach to them now.。
Try it.。
Follow your passion.。
Share it.。
I think Benson is the God of Band.。
That's why he is called Benson.。
He plays everything by himself.。
He also writes songs.。
You can try to listen to their songs.。
Today, he deliberately does not bring his own songs.。
Because today he is not promoting himself.。
He wants everyone to see that he is God.。
So today, I want to say to him,。
"Finally, we only have 5 minutes left.。
Go for it."。
1, 2, 3.。
I can hear you.。
Yeah.。
Yes.。
I really want to share with you。
what I have witnessed。
especially in U of R.。
Actually, everyone is very young.。
I have also experienced。
being so young like everyone else.。
But I found that。
when I was...。
How did I experience my middle school?。
I had a lot of things I wanted to do。
or a lot of thoughts.。
Is there anyone who...。
There are always...。
What is it called?。
Besides having a lot of thoughts,。
there are also times when you feel emo.。
Is there anyone like that?。
If so, can you raise your hand?。
Oh, maybe you don't dare to raise your hand.。
I want to say that。
in a middle school environment,。
I had a lot of emotions。
and different thoughts.。
But I want to say that。
God's design for me is very special.。
He made me like music very much.。
I also like to play.。
So when I came to U of R,。
God...。
I mean, Yong Ge, he challenged me.。
"Benson, have you ever thought about。
what this generation needs?"。
Maybe what everyone needs。
is not just what we usually need。
in school.。
It's actually about。
how we can take one more step forward.。
God really made us do something.。
What did God make me do?。
It's worship.。
So when I'm here,。
I really want to...。
I really want to show people。
that worship is very important.。
Everyone here is a Christian.。
Worship is very important.。
Worship is a moment。
where you can communicate with God sincerely.。
It's not just about singing.。
So I went to a school。
and developed a worship course with Yong Ge.。
And I wanted to create a band。
with a group of people.。
We wanted to share our original songs。
and messages.。
It's like a little stone。
thrown into a pool of water.。
It creates a chain.。
When you turn it,。
it will spread fire.。
Life affects life.。
But I found out that it wasn't enough.。
What was not enough?。
It turned out that 80% of young people。
are still going to school.。
So what should we do?。
We went straight to the school.。
What should we do?。
One day, when I thought about it,。
I found out that God was telling me。
that everyone has been very tired and painful。
in the past few years.。
Because the worst thing is that。
it's painful but you can't say it.。
Yong Ge said,。
"Why don't we make a musical drama。
called 'Pain Is Not New'?"。
I believe everyone likes to watch shows.。
If you go to Kitee Academy,。
I heard there is a co-play.。
I don't know if anyone has tickets.。
But if we can bring the show to school,。
will it make it easier for everyone to understand。
what Jesus Christ is like?。
Especially when we talk about pain,。
when we can't talk about it,。
what I want to say is that。
do you think Jesus Christ has never been in pain?。
Do you think he doesn't understand you?。
He experienced it like this。
more than 2,000 years ago.。
But he is the God of resurrection.。
So today we can rely on him。
to experience this resurrection,。
to be healed again,。
to regain that life,。
to be rejuvenated.。
So we built this musical drama。
and composed five original songs.。
And we've been to...。
In the past year,。
we've been to 20 schools。
and we've met about 8,000 students。
and led 1,200 students to believe in Jesus.。
I want to say that this is not a given.。
The point is not the number.。
The point is that。
I am a man,。
a man who seems to be very insignificant,。
but God can use me.。
So today, he is not just using me,。
but he is using each and every one of you.。
It's just a matter of whether you are willing to be used by God.。
Thank you, everyone.。
Thank you, Benson.。
Let's give a round of applause to Benson.。
He shared his life story with me in a very effective way.。
In fact, this situation of pain and resurrection,。
when we went to school,。
we observed that many people,。
especially high school students, cried.。
Okay?。
Because they really had a resonance.。
The second thing is that we don't just believe in Jesus.。
Do you need to pray?。
Many people need to pray.。
I need a way out.。
I have already gone to hell.。
So the teacher and the pastor immediately responded,。
and immediately prayed for him.。
So that he could have an experience.。
So we found that it's not just the stage。
or the moment you're desperate,。
but someone accompanies you through the process of life.。
After death, you will be raised from the dead.。
There is a position that cannot be replaced.。
It is the pastor in the life of Jesus Christ.。
He has to personally let us go through the process of death,。
and he is not afraid of doing harm.。
They have to feel the faith of their whole life.。
It's not just you talking about your faith,。
your witness.。
They have to have a personal liberation of life.。
I tell you, when we go there,。
we are just a small team.。
Our ability is very limited.。
If you like music,。
you can worship together.。
Let's walk together.。
Not just here.。
Can you organize a group of people to go to the mass?。
This is a challenge.。
Many college students start to walk together like this.。
They know it's not easy.。
In the past, there was a gathering。
where we often had college students' DSC training.。
There was a time when the pandemic was the most difficult.。
The political situation was unstable.。
In 2020,。
my son was in the first grade.。
And then,。
he just finished his school in June.。
After hearing that we need to witness,。
many college students came to the mass.。
About 50 to 60 people.。
Many of them knelt down.。
They knelt down to respond to God.。
The reason is that。
you don't have to stand in the middle for your generation.。
You don't have to connect with God.。
Can you do this for our generation?。
I called my son to visit.。
He is not 18 years old.。
I don't know if he can still hear the echo.。
Can you not just stick to this generation?。
You are over 18 years old.。
You even passed the DSC.。
Can you help our generation?。
Help us fight a battle.。
Wow.。
Many of them were touched.。
Not just for this generation.。
What was the most touching?。
My son.。
He was the last one to come out.。
I said, "Son, I call my college students.。
What does it have to do with you?"。
"Do you understand what I just said?"。
"Can you hear me? It's so deep."。
He said, "No, dad. I understand."。
And I don't want to just have college students。
to fight for me.。
I also have to call my generation。
to fight for our generation.。
We have to fight for our generation。
to win.。
Wow.。
I really appreciate it.。
I held him and cried.。
I prayed.。
Actually, calling everyone。
has nothing to do with me.。
I can only call my son.。
He is my second son.。
He is my generation's generation.。
He is willing to be a。
Nasi Iyen worshiper.。
He started to work hard on his equipment.。
He wants to play the piano better.。
He wants to be more like his peers.。
Last week,。
he led 100 people to pray in a worship meeting.。
He started to play the piano.。
He started to speak out his voice.。
He said, "I want to pray for this generation.。
I only need you.。
I only want to see you."。
Wow.。
He and his generation cried out to Jesus together.。
"We want you to be our center.。
We want to continue to fight for your country,。
your will, and your unity."。
Hong Kong has these young people。
as our partners.。
It's not just young people who fight.。
The previous generation,。
college students,。
or believers,。
you are already on the battlefield.。
We need everyone to walk together.。
When Moses was praying on the mountain,。
Joshua was the only one who won.。
Joshua, you need to know。
you are not alone.。
So when we came here,。
we distributed our prayer nets.。
We said, "Today,。
we will pray for the young people of Hong Kong.。
We will have a worship meeting。
and a message sharing.。
We hope they will wake up.。
We hope they can connect with God。
from all angles."。
We called them to pray.。
We really want David to fight。
with his whole life.。
We also want him to build a church。
in the next generation.。
This is a beautiful church.。
But don't just stay in the building.。
We need to become the church,。
the altar of the flow of blood.。
We need to become the living altar.。
This is worship.。
Worship is life.。
Worship is not when you are praying.。
Worship is not when you are teaching.。
Worship is our life.。
Can we live out God's message like this?。
Lastly,。
can you use all your strength。
to carry the burden of Elijah。
so that you can face。
double evil?。
We need the grace of God。
from the previous generation.。
The favor of God.。
Let's fight together。
in the Lord's presence.。
I know we have limited time.。
Sorry, I have 5 more minutes.。
But I really want to pray for you.。
Today, I don't need to call everyone.。
The key number chosen by God。
is that one person.。
To call Jesus,。
that person can walk into the gap。
and become a stone。
to turn the world.。
But there is a foundation behind it.。
Jesus came with 12 disciples。
and followed his path.。
Then he turned the whole Roman Empire.。
The whole world turned because of the gospel.。
So today, if you are willing to say,。
"Lord, I am here.。
I know I am the chosen one of your dream.。
I know you chose me as the priest of the military。
to stand in the middle of the field to pray.。
So that when we see the need for the church,。
we can go with you。
and our friends。
to the darkness.。
We can be the light.。
We are willing to be the saints。
and do all kinds of good deeds.。
We are also willing to ask you to help us。
to be the saints。
and be the children of God.。
We can be united like this,。
to be united with each other,。
to be the same generation。
and to be the next generation,。
the new generation of the three or four generations.。
Lord, please fill this heart。
so that we can continue to be strong for you.。
Please hear our prayer in front of you.。
In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.。
