- Well, as you saw with the film,。
today we are considering the parable of the prodigal son,。
perhaps the most beloved of all the parables。
that Jesus told.。
When I told a friend last week,。
I was preaching on the parable of the prodigal son.。
He raised the question,。
who is the most stressed out in this parable?。
I thought the son, the father,。
or the older brother were in different ways,。
rather stressed, but I was wrong.。
My friend said, the one who was most stressed out。
was the fatted calf.。
(audience laughing)。
(audience laughing)。
This story called the gospel within the gospel。
and the world's greatest short story。
is the climax of three stories of lost things.。
A lost sheep, a lost coin,。
and lastly, a lost son.。
The sheep is lost,。
perhaps through careless wandering or inattention.。
The coin is lost through no evident reason.。
But the heartbreak of this story is the son who is lost。
through deliberate rebellious choice.。
(audience laughing)。
Look at the heading in your Bible.。
It almost certainly highlights this lost prodigal son.。
It usually entitled the lost son or the prodigal son.。
But make no mistake.。
This story is primarily。
about a father.。
And it comes from the mouth of Jesus,。
a son who knew his father。
and he wanted lost people to know the father.。
And this parable dramatises。
four characteristics of the father.。
Let's read a few verses to kick off.。
Verse 11.。
And he said, there was a man who had two sons。
and the younger of them said to his father,。
"Father, give me the share of the property。
that's coming to me."。
And he divided his property between them.。
Not many days later,。
the younger son gathered all he had。
and took a journey into a far country.。
And there he squandered his property in reckless living.。
And we see the first characteristic of the father is this.。
The father gives us freedom to choose.。
The father allows the younger son to leave.。
Sometimes the worst thing that God can do。
is to give us what we want.。
To show us that our desires cannot bring satisfaction.。
The prodigal son got what he wanted.。
But lost what he had.。
Can I say that again?。
The prodigal son got what he wanted,。
but lost what he had.。
When we rebel against God's will,。
he sometimes says to us,。
"Okay, you win.。
Your will be done."。
Those of us who are parents,。
do you want your children to make good choices?。
Of course you do.。
Do you say no when they ask for something foolish。
or dangerous?。
Of course you do.。
An observation here,。
this is a lot easier when they're young.。
So much harder as children grow up.。
As a parent, I'd often wonder what God was thinking of。
when he dreamed up the blueprint for teenagers.。
But let's not go there.。
The first characteristic of this father。
is he allows his children freedom to choose.。
Whether the choices are wise or foolish,。
selfish or loving.。
Now the father's assets would not have been in cash.。
He wouldn't have been in the first century equivalent。
of HSBC.。
It would have been in land and livestock.。
Charles, illiquid you would say, right?。
Illiquid.。
Deuteronomy 21, 17 tells us by Mosaic law,。
a younger son's portion was one third.。
Thus his selfish demand would have required the father。
to liquidate a significant portion of all he owned.。
Notice the son's demand in verse 12.。
Give me a share of the property that is coming to me.。
Now, both the son and the father knew that his portion。
was to pass to him only when the father died.。
He was in reality and in Hebrew culture saying,。
father, I now choose to regard you as though you're dead.。
That is the seriousness of what we're talking about here.。
And yet, and yet the father freely gave of his possessions。
to the young son who had no assets of his own.。
Church, doesn't this remind you of the cries of our society?。
The voice of our age is the voice of entitlement.。
Oh, don't tell me what to do.。
I want to do what I wanna do.。
I deserve these things.。
I'm owed these things.。
I depend on myself.。
God, God tries to control me。
and just wants me to follow his rules.。
It sounds just like the younger son, doesn't it?。
But think for a moment of the heavenly father。
who is pictured in this earthly story.。
It is all his.。
He has made us.。
All we have comes from his gracious hand。
and his loving heart.。
And yet as we so often selfishly demand our own rights,。
our desires and our wants,。
our heavenly father gives us the freedom。
to do as we want and choose as we will.。
He allows us to spend our time, our assets,。
our skills and our gifts in the way that we choose.。
His love gives us freedom.。
Even if our freedom leads to loss and waste.。
But it is our choice.。
And it is the freedom a loving father gives。
for he will have no slaves or puppets,。
whatever the cost to him or us.。
The second characteristic of the father is this.。
The father suffers.。
Clearly in this story, the father grieves,。
grieves over his son's wrong decision.。
This is the second characteristic I want us to understand。
about the father.。
He is hurt by the son's choice.。
Imagine the loss of possessions, the loss of reputation。
and more than anything else,。
the loss of relationship with the son he loves.。
He feels the pain of rejection.。
I don't care about a relationship with you.。
I only care about what I can get from you.。
Shout the actions of the son.。
But remind yourself again.。
This story is first about the father.。
And can I say many of us have a wrong image。
of God the father.。
Perhaps dare I say, shaped by our own experience。
of our own human fathers.。
Have you not met those who even if they do believe。
in God at all, imagine him to be cold, uncaring, uninvolved.。
Is that how you see God the father?。
Be honest.。
I need to tell you, that is a lie.。
That is a lie told by an enemy。
that wants to keep us in a far country,。
wasting our lives and trying to provide meekly。
for ourselves.。
From Genesis to Revelation, we see a loving God.。
Grieving over the very ones who reject him.。
God grieves when his own rebellious people。
who had turned their backs on him, turn to other gods.。
Look at these passages, I've put them on the screen.。
Jesus in Matthew 23.。
Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets。
and stones those who are sent it.。
How often would I have gathered your children together。
as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings?。
And you would not.。
Or God the father in the Old Testament。
in the book of Hosea chapter 11.。
He says, "Oh, how can I give you up Israel?。
How can I let you go?。
My heart is torn within me and my compassion overflows."。
I'm sure that some of you here today are thinking,。
I know exactly how that father feels.。
I have a child, I have a loved one。
who has also gone to a far country.。
She is also distant from me.。
He's wasting the precious things he's been given.。
She's throwing away her life.。
He thinks he's really living, but he's really dying.。
You need to know that God the father agrees。
for those who are like the lost son。
also has a compassion for your pain too.。
More than you can know.。
Could you be a better parent?。
Yeah, of course.。
But even the perfect father himself。
had children who turned their backs on him。
and chose what they wanted over relationship。
with a loving father.。
But note in the parable,。
the father suffered, but the son also suffers.。
There are two sons in this parable.。
So consider with me for a moment, this younger son.。
So vividly portrayed are the consequences。
of the supposed freedom he enjoys.。
Let's read it.。
And when he spent everything,。
a severe famine arose in that country。
and he began to be in need.。
So he went and hired himself out。
to one of the citizens of that country。
who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.。
I'm just gonna pause there。
because how abhorrent would that be to a Jewish audience?。
A pig was unclean, right?。
And he was longing to be fed with the pods。
that the pigs ate and no one gave him anything.。
So the rebellious son suffers too.。
The first days of freedom, hey, they were heady。
and glorious, full of white women and song as we say.。
Only when he had wasted all。
do the consequences of his choice begin to bite.。
Only when he has spent everything,。
only when he spent everything he's been given。
is there a severe famine in that country.。
Only when he has wasted everything he has been given。
does he begin to be in need.。
He spent his father's resources without his father.。
Let me repeat that.。
He spent his father's resources without his father.。
And here's the truth we all need to know.。
Whenever we try to use the resources and provisions。
of the father, independent of the father,。
we will always run out.。
Oh, it may be fine for a time.。
Life is going well.。
Life is good.。
But sooner or later a famine will arise。
and we will begin to be in need.。
And like that young son in that far country,。
we try fruitlessly to provide for ourselves.。
But we'll still be hungry。
because it is only in the father's house。
in relationship with the father that we will be satisfied.。
I'm gonna say that again,。
'cause if you only remember one line。
from this sermon tonight, you need to remember this one.。
It is only in the father's house。
in relationship with the father that we will be satisfied.。
Third characteristic of the father。
is that the father waits.。
The father gives freedom to choose.。
The father hurts and grieves over his son.。
And here is some good news at last.。
The father is waiting.。
The father is waiting.。
He hasn't locked the gate.。
He hasn't disowned this young scoundrel of a son。
who has brought sorrow and disgrace to the family.。
The father is waiting for him.。
He's been standing on that porch every day。
since his son left just in case.。
How do we know that?。
Let's read it.。
But when he, the prodigal came to himself, he said,。
"How many of my father's hired servants。
have more than enough bread?。
But I perish here with hungry.。
I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him,。
'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.。
I am no longer worthy to be called your son.。
Treat me as one of your hired servants.'。
And he arose and came to his father.。
But while he was a long way off,。
his father saw him and felt compassion.。
And he ran and embraced him.。
And kissed him.。
The father was not only waiting,。
but he must have been eagerly looking for that son of his。
because he saw him when he was a long way off.。
Think with me, how long does the father wait?。
It doesn't tell us by the way.。
Is it days?。
Is it months?。
Is it years?。
How long does the father wait?。
He waits as long as it takes.。
He waits as long as it takes.。
He doesn't give up on the young son.。
He doesn't write him off.。
He waits until the lost son comes to himself.。
When the son comes to himself, he sees clearly.。
He sees his father and himself.。
He now understands the blessing。
and generosity of his father's household.。
There's more than enough there for sons and servants.。
And painfully, but honestly, he realises he is unworthy.。
He is unworthy of grace, unworthy of forgiveness,。
unworthy of relationship.。
All that should speak to our hearts.。
We are as unworthy and dirty as that prodigal son.。
We stink of the pig pen.。
But Jesus took care of that with his life。
and death for us in our place.。
And that is why we are children of praise。
and gratitude and thanksgiving.。
Look at this.。
This is 1 John 3, 1.。
I could have picked many verses for this.。
Look at how great a love the father has given us。
that we should be called God's children.。
And we are.。
Romans 5, while we are utterly helpless,。
Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners.。
Now, most people would not be willing to die。
for an upright person,。
though someone might be perhaps willing to die。
for a person who's especially good.。
But God showed his great love for us。
by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners.。
Wow.。
And what we see next is the lost son follows through.。
Now, before we look at the final characteristic。
of the father, consider something about this prodigal son。
who has shown himself quite worthless up to this point.。
When he comes home at his lowest point,。
hungry and dirty and homeless with the pigs,。
he realises he has believed lies。
about his life and his father.。
He says to himself something like this,。
I will get up and get out of this mess.。
I've got myself into this mess.。
I'm gonna go to my father。
and I will openly repent and humble myself.。
That's my understanding of the words at any rate.。
And that's exactly what he does.。
Church, it's not enough to have a moment of insight.。
It's not enough to realise how low you've sunk。
and how far you are from the father.。
It's not enough to realise you're miserable。
and hungry in the pig pen.。
It's not enough to spread a little cologne。
to cover the smell of the pig pen.。
Over the years, many I have talked to and prayed for。
who said they were going to do this,。
but have never followed through.。
If this is you today, it is time to follow through.。
It is time to get up and return to your waiting father。
and tell him I'm not worthy, but here I am,。
just as I am without one plea.。
And here's the best news of all.。
The father forgives.。
This is the last characteristic I want you to see today.。
Forthly, the father forgives.。
And the son says to him,。
"Father, I've sinned against heaven and before you.。
I'm no longer worthy to be called your son."。
But the father said to his servants,。
"Bring quickly the best robe and put it on him.。
Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.。
Bring the fattened calf and kill it。
and let's us eat and celebrate.。
For this my son was dead and is alive again,。
was lost and is found."。
And they began to celebrate.。
Don't you just love that?。
The father doesn't ask for an inventory.。
He doesn't twist any screws by talking on how much。
he himself has lost or suffered.。
He doesn't even put the son on probation,。
which let's be honest,。
most of us think he deserves.。
He doesn't even take up the prodigal sincere offer。
of servitude in place of sonship.。
Instead, he immediately forgives.。
He immediately accepts.。
He immediately restores relationship.。
And that's why the robe, the ring and the shoes,。
that's what they signify.。
He immediately rejoices.。
What a picture of our loving heavenly father who forgives.。
He doesn't keep a record of our wrongs.。
No inventory, no grudge, no probationary period.。
That's your father in heaven.。

As we close,。
I want you to take a little time。
to think of this simple, vivid story。
of an earthly father with two sons,。
giving freedom to choose, suffering, waiting, forgiving,。
and then think of God, your heavenly father.。
Do you know him in this way?。
Do you see him in this way?。
He wants you to.。
Jesus, the son, said, "This is what the father is like."。
Can we have the banner, please?。
(sighing)。
This is a time for your own personal response。
to what we've just said.。
We're going to sing the song, Run to the Father.。
If anyone wants to get up and run to the front,。
you're perfectly able to.。
If you do, we'll pray for you.。
But I want you, I'm not going to prescribe this.。
I want you to respond to this in your own way.。
We'll run to the father differently.。
Some of you, while we're singing,。
you just might want to be quiet before him.。
Just spend that time with him.。
That's fine.。
Some of you, as we sing this song,。
may just want to picture,。
you know, we saw the reading on film.。
Maybe you just want to picture。
that son who was far away coming home.。
And the father who'd been waiting every day,。
running after his son.。
Welcome him back.。
I don't want anyone to leave here tonight。
without knowing the love of the father.。
(soft piano music)。
If you want somebody after the service。
to pray for you, to put their arms around you,。
to pray the love of the father,。
we're here to do that.。
But let's just stand for a moment.。
Father, when we were a long way off,。
you called us.。
And you brought us home for your son, Jesus Christ.。
Through the sacrificial death。
and the resurrection of Jesus Christ,。
we can call you father.。
(soft piano music)。
I just want you to imagine now,。
you've come back.。
The father's arms have gone around you.。
The father is saying,。
George, Julian,。
Kelly,。
all I want you to know right now。
is that you're my son.。
You're my daughter.。
I love you.。
And I'm so proud of you.。
You know that, your heavenly father's so proud of you,。
each one of you.。
And you say, but you don't know what I've done this week.。
This thing and that thing.。
And it's right to repent of sin, of course it is.。
God the father looks at you.。
All he sees is love.。
Allow him now,。
just to put his arms around you。
and receive that love.。
You are his beloved child.。
In you he is well pleased.。
(soft piano music)。
So let's sing run to the father.。
(gentle music)。
