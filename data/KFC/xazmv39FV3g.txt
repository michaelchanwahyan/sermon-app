Good night, everyone.。
Good night.。
I almost wanted to say, all right, good night, we're done.。
All right, let's do it again.。
Good evening, everyone.。
All right, not yet nighttime, but it is nighttime.。
I'm so excited to be sharing the word of God with you tonight.。

We can't be happy about ourselves.。
It's judgmental, it's critical, it's finger pointing.。
And yet, this is not the world that God wants for us.。
What is God's kingdom for us?。
Is for acceptance and grace in the midst of our imperfections.。
And that's why we need Jesus.。
And so today we're going to look at Mary Magdalene and how Jesus interacted with her so that。
we can understand.。
How is it that he has accepted her so that we can be accepted by him as well and that。
we can extend that acceptance to other people around us.。
Now who is Mary Magdalene anyways?。
Well, she has appeared in the gospel for 12 times.。
And she was most likely called Magdalene because she lived in Magdala.。
And it is in the western side.。
If you like, here's a map for those who like maps.。
It's on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee.。
And people used to call themselves by where they live so that we can differentiate which。
Mary it is.。
And there are quite a few in the Bible.。
And so from Luke 8, let's look at it together where the beginning of when we hear about。
Mary.。
Now in Luke 8 verse 1 to 3 it says here, "Jesus traveled about from one town and village to。
another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God.。
The 12 were with him and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases.。
Mary called Magdalene from whom seven demons had come out.。
Joanna, the wife of Chuza, and the manager of Harold's household.。
Susanna and many others.。
These women were helping to support them out of their own means."。
Now interesting to note that Jesus actually didn't always just traveled with his disciples.。
In this case, he traveled with a bunch of women as well.。
And who are these women?。
They have been healed and delivered from Jesus of demons or different diseases.。
But none of them were spelled out except the one that Mary Magdalene.。
And she was possessed by seven demons.。
That's what we know about her.。
Now they were not there just to watch and learn from Jesus.。
They were there actually to provide for him.。
And Mary Magdalene was one of them.。
Now can you imagine, does anybody have any idea what it's like to be demon possessed?。
Okay.。
None of us have had that experience.。
And we wonder what does that look like?。
Well if we reference to other gospels, we're going to see that there had been two demon。
possessed men recorded before.。
And they were violent.。
And they were out of their mind.。
They even slashed themselves and they were not wearing any clothes.。
And they were yelling out all the time.。
So what we do find is that those who are demon possessed most likely had an external manifestation.。
Somebody knew that that person was demon possessed.。
So it wasn't like an internal issue.。
It was an external one that everyone saw.。
But what was Jesus' heart?。
Did he despise her?。
Did he reject her?。
No.。
We saw that Jesus healed her.。
He had the mercy for her.。
And afterwards allowed her to stay with the rest of them.。
Now he could have easily said, "Oh, I don't want to be associated with someone who had。
been demon possessed just in case other people thought he was or his disciples was."。
So this brings us to our first point, that Jesus has a heart to accept the rejected by。
staying close to them.。
Now Mary was someone that people probably gossiped around, talked about, maybe in front。
of her or right behind her back.。
Maybe because of her gender, her social acceptance, or what has happened, the seven demons, you。
know the person with the seven demons, that's her.。
And people didn't want to be associated with her.。
But Jesus accepted her.。
Why is it that Jesus is able to accept her?。
Was it because she has done anything right?。
Probably not.。
It was because Jesus was full of love and compassion.。
Now most of us here, or none of us, has ever been demon possessed.。
But all of us probably have had a past or a struggle or some sort of failure.。
Now no doubt when that happens, it'll put a question in our mind.。
Are we good enough?。
Am I really that bad?。
When things are happening, don't those things repeat in your mind?。
And in case self-doubt wasn't detrimental enough, you know what the demon does?。
He puts a few people, not a lot, you know, just a few people around you.。
And they'll make sure you know what's wrong with you.。
They might blame you, right out say you're not good enough, or even say it's your fault.。
If you didn't do that, this wouldn't have happened.。
So whatever it is you're going through, some people might even say maybe she has done something。
wrong, that's why she was demon possessed.。
But you see, Jesus is not like that.。
He doesn't define us by what we're doing or what we're going through or what's happening.。
He defines us by the fact that we are sons and daughters of the living God.。
He loves us immensely.。
And so when we've received this kind of acceptance, it begs the question, do we extend this kind。
of acceptance to the people around us?。
Now like the Pharisees, they're unlike Jesus, right?。
What do the Pharisees do?。
They stay away.。
They said, this is an unclean person.。
This person is of low status.。
I don't want to be associated with them.。
Instead, what do they say?。
Look at me.。
Look at how good I am.。
I can recite the scripture backwards.。
I don't have this issue with this thing.。
I don't have this sickness.。
I'm good.。
I'm better.。
So when we have accepted Jesus and see how he has accepted us, we need to be careful。
and examine our hearts.。
Are we standing in a place of judgment for others?。
Now growing up, I was never a popular kid.。
I often spoke my ideas and they might be disregarded.。
I didn't quite have it together.。
My father passed away when I was nine, and I was fatherless since then.。
And I immigrated to Canada.。
I think I only spoke 10 words of English when I arrived.。
I wasn't fluent for sure.。
And I wasn't sporty enough, and I definitely wasn't tall enough to play any sports where。
people might actually think I'm good at it.。
And really for the longest time, I was single.。
And even after getting married, it took so much effort to make things work.。
And even as a pastor, I'm a female, and I'm green.。
I don't have much experience.。
I don't have it all together.。
And sometimes I too struggle with feeling accepted.。
And yet, whenever it is that I turn to my father in heaven, I know that I'm fully accepted。
for who I am.。
Is it because I'm perfect?。
Definitely not.。
It is only because he loves me.。
And I want to say that's the same thing for you.。
No matter what it is that you're going through or has been going through, don't let that。
be a stigma.。
He doesn't define you by those things.。
He defines you because he loves you and has fully accepted you.。
And I'm so thankful that in my life, there has been other people who have exemplified。
that kind of acceptance.。
Of course, you know, he's already patting on his shoulder.。
How do you know this, Charles?。
Pastor John's one of them.。
Sandra.。
Whenever I might be in self-doubt, they give me that big hug that I think my bones are。
going to crush sometimes.。
And even when I'm not doubting, they give me that hug.。
Or I have my seminary teacher.。
And whenever I go to him, I'm like, I'm not sure about this.。
He would guide me.。
He would help me.。
Even though I've graduated two years, I think he must be thinking, wow, this person never。
going to stop coming.。
I'm sure not.。
I'm sure not.。
He's very thankful and just accepting of where I am.。
And of course, there are many of you guys too that I'm able to connect.。
And you've asked me out for dinners, going over to your places, and just connect.。
You would invite me, my husband, Isabella.。
We'll all go.。
And by the way, if you invite my extended family, I'll bring them all over too.。
And I really sense that acceptance.。
I want to say we all need people around us to accept us.。
And sometimes we might be the one that's struggling.。
We can go to God.。
But at the same time, we can be that person that tells other people that, hey, we accept。
you.。
We see where you are, and we love you.。
We can be that person for other people.。
And so let us accept those who are rejected or feeling rejected by staying close to them.。
Now as we read on, there's another record of Mary Magdalene in the gospel.。
And it is in John chapter 20, where Mary alone experiences the first and the most profound。
moment where she sees the resurrected Jesus.。
Now it was right after that Jesus was crucified, and he was laid in his tomb.。
And it was dark that night, and Mary went there.。
And she was trying to see Jesus.。
But she saw that the tombstone was open.。
So he ran straight to his disciples.。
Simon, Peter, and another person, most likely disciple John.。
And what happened was they all rushed over to see what happened.。
And when they saw that the tombstone was open, they believed.。
And the disciples went back to where they were.。
But Mary stayed there, and she was weeping.。
And that's where the scripture that we heard Bonnie read earlier.。
She was crying in the tomb.。
She doesn't know where the Lord is.。
And yet there are two angels that were inside.。
And they asked her, "Why are you crying?"。
She said, "I don't know.。
Somebody took Jesus.。
Can you tell me where he is?"。
And so let's read this together.。
John 20, from verse 14 to 18.。
At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there.。
This is Mary.。
But she did not realize that it was Jesus.。
He asked her, "Women, why are you crying?。
Who is it that you're looking for?"。
"Thinking he was a gardener," she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where。
you have put him, and I will get him."。
Jesus said to her, "Mary."。
She turned towards him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni," which means "teacher."。
Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father.。
Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father,。
to my God and your God.'"。
Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news.。
"I have seen the Lord."。
And she told them that he had said these things to her.。
You see, Mary Magdalene, she was crying and thought Jesus was the gardener.。
Who would have taken Jesus, she thought.。
But Jesus told her, as he says, "Mary."。
She recognizes him right away.。
Now this verse, one verse is a little bit hard.。
Why is it that Jesus has told her, "Don't hold on to me yet, for I have not ascended。
to the Father."。
What does that mean?。
Well, it's likely because Jesus' permanent form has not come about yet.。
And she's telling her in this spiritual sense, "Don't hold on to this current me.。
I'm going to come back with a permanent form.。
You cannot hold on to what it is now.。
Things will change."。
And this dialogue, what we see is Jesus accepting someone in sorrow.。
He was definitely finishing off a very important mission.。
FYI, salvation is a very important mission.。
He has already finished crucifixion.。
He has risen, but he did not go to the Father yet to come back.。
And yet, he's willing to stop for someone, someone very special.。
Mary Magdalene, who was in sorrow.。
And so this brings us to our second point, that Jesus has a heart to accept the sorrowful。
by empathizing with them.。
You know, it's one thing to care for someone, but it's another thing to accept their sorrow.。
Now in this age and time, we're probably too busy, too unempathetic towards people who。
are in pain.。
And a lot of times what we'll say is, "I'll pray for you, and then we'll leave."。
And a lot of times, even when people are in sorrow, we might be judging them and think,。
"What's wrong?。
It's only a small matter.。
Why are you crying over this?"。
And anybody in your situation, they'll take care of it like that.。
What is wrong with you?。
Do we have that empathetic sense to be feeling where they're feeling?。
And obviously, you know, for Jesus, he already knows what's going to happen, right?。
He knows in about a few days' time, he's going to come back.。
You know, if I were Jesus, maybe I'll go like, "Okay, I know she's crying, but it'll only。
be for a few more days.。
Let me finish off this really important mission.。
I'll come back."。
But Jesus is not like that.。
In your most painful moment, he stops everything for you because he accepts your sorrow, and。
he's not going to judge that.。
And so when we're in pain, even if no one understands, we know we can go to him and。
he will accept us.。
You know, emotions doesn't have right or wrong.。
It's just there.。
And the difference between empathy and sympathy, I think we've talked about it before, but。
I want to say it again, is because empathy is really being in another person's shoes。
and trying to feel what they're feeling, not being in their shoes and feeling what you。
think they're feeling.。
You're trying to feel that.。
And sympathy really is just saying, "I have pity, and you know what?。
I'm thankful it's not happening to me."。
Sympathy.。
And so here we see that the heart of Jesus is to accept.。
Now one of my best friend, and she's here tonight, but I won't point her out.。
She doesn't like it.。
She always empathizes with me when I'm in sorrow.。
Whenever I'm in my deepest sorrow, I go to her and I cry.。
And sometimes I'm surprised because we might be praying, and by the time I open my eyes,。
she's crying as well.。
And when I'm angry, she's angry with me.。
And we can be angry together.。
No angry birds, right?。
And in front of her, I never felt for a moment that my tears would be judged or my frustrations。
would be judged, because she accepted that in that moment, that's what I felt.。
And I feel like we can all be like that for someone.。
Rather than just accepting how God accepts our feelings and emotions, would we also be。
that person for someone else?。
Don't judge.。
Don't say, "Well, you've brought it onto yourself, so there you go."。
No.。
Just try to feel what they're feeling.。
And as a new mom, that's sometimes not easy for me.。
And there has been nights where I get my milk bottle ready.。
My little one back there, in case you don't know, it's six months old.。
Her name is Isabella.。
And I would try to give her the milk, and she won't have it.。
I put it in her mouth, and she goes like...。
She's really good at dodging.。
So one day, I think she can play dodgeball or something.。
So she dodges it.。
And there I am.。
And this is 1 AM.。
In my head, I'm thinking, "All right.。
Mommy's only doing this not because it's fun, but I want you to grow up nice and strong。
and tall, okay?"。
So there I am doing this the whole time I'm thinking this.。
And I'm like, "You know what?。
Let's have this milk so we can both go to bed, okay?"。
And so just when I'm about to say it, I swallow it back down.。
Because I'm thinking, "I'm not this baby.。
Do I remember or know what it feels like to be eating only one kind of food for six months?。
Does anybody remember what it feels like to only drink milk for six months?"。
I know we've all done it, but none of us remember.。
And so even as a baby, when she can't speak, I'm trying to sympathize with her that in。
this moment in time, I don't want milk.。
And so I'll be, "Okay, no milk.。
Let's go to bed."。
And maybe I said goodnight at the very beginning.。
And I wonder, can we sympathize with the people around us?。
And I'm not saying we need to do that for everybody, because some people can really。
talk and talk and talk and talk, and we can't.。
But can we start with the people around us first?。
What about our parents when they're upset?。
Like, "Why are you still staying up?"。
They're like, "I don't care.。
Just let me do my thing."。
Will we for a moment sympathize, not sympathize, empathize with them?。
They love me so much.。
Or when our spouse, when they're crying, instead of like, "Okay, I have to go watch TV and。
just ignore."。
Can we just stay there and say, "Hey, what are you feeling?。
Tell me all about it."。
And same thing when it's our child.。
Maybe we've said something to anger them, and they look like they're very upset about。
it.。
Are we just gonna ignore it or try to feel what they're feeling?。
What is it that I have said that has upset you?。
Would we do that?。
Now from the same passage in John, we see that there's also an interesting countercultural。
action that Jesus has done.。
Jesus said to Mary in verse seven, "Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending。
to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"。
Now this good news about the risen Lord was actually given to a woman.。
Now not only any woman, but a woman who has once been possessed by seven demons.。
And it shows that God is not showing partiality, that he's willing to commission whosoever。
heart is pointed towards Jesus.。
So this brings us to our third point, that Jesus' heart to accept even the lowly by commissioning。
them.。
Of all the people in the world that you would choose to be the first person to see the resurrected。
Jesus, who would it be?。
I don't know, you may say Peter, John, right?。
At least pick one of the disciples.。
But no, Jesus picked Mary Magdalene, someone with a past, someone who was demon possessed.。
Now this is out of your mind, right?。
First she was a woman.。
And what did that mean?。
Especially in such a male dominated world.。
It meant that her words were not credible at all.。
And at that time, most of the women did not have any education.。
So she probably didn't write or read.。
And the third thing, she was demon possessed.。
Now if you were going to say the Lord has risen, does that sound crazy?。
It sounded pretty crazy.。
People might say, "Oh my goodness, she's demon possessed again."。
So why would Jesus still entrust this important message for Mary Magdalene to preach back。
to the disciples?。
It is because he shows no partiality.。
For us humans, we see people by their appearance and see if they're the elite ones.。
But God looks at a person's heart.。
And so it doesn't matter whatever things you're going through or has been through, if you。
think you're lesser of someone or if someone tells you outright that you're lesser of someone,。
don't let that discourage you.。
As long as you love the Lord, he will commission you no matter what because he sees the heart.。
And so we might fall into the same trap.。
As we accept fully from what God accepts us for, do we also extend that acceptance to。
someone else?。
I mean, it's very easy for us to always find the people who seem to have it all together。
to do this or to do that.。
Oh, that person, let's not find her.。
Let's not find him.。
It's very easy for us humans to do that.。
But let us be accepting like the Lord.。
If that person loves the Lord, let them try.。
Let them do it.。
If they don't have enough of the training or background, let's give it to them.。
And so a few years back, I was serving at a church and something happened.。
So a bunch of people left and I was serving as one of the worship leaders.。
I know I was serving.。
And we didn't have enough people to be there.。
And so I looked around and I saw people who loved the Lord.。
They really loved him.。
And they're singing their hearts out every time when we were worshiping.。
So I went ahead and I asked, "Hey, would you guys like to be on the worship team?"。
And they're like, "Can we?"。
I was like, "Do you love the Lord?"。
"Yeah."。
"Do you like to worship?"。
"Yeah."。
"All right, you're on."。
But they're not your usual worship team.。
Now, I would say all of them were 55 and above.。
And some of them retiring or have retired.。
No musical training.。
Never been on stage.。
They don't know the first thing about worship.。
But you know what?。
They have the heart.。
Let's go for it.。
So I still remember vividly, I got seven of them.。
I was teaching them the keyboard.。
And they had these rolled out portable keyboards.。
They were so cute doing those.。
And then we had drum lessons we learned together.。
And even back then, I've only learned drums for a year.。
We did it.。
And then everybody-- OK, I have to tell you the reality.。
The reality was none of them mastered the keyboards.。
One person could play the drum.。
But all of them were able to sing.。
And we had these worship nights where it was just spirit-filled.。
And I still remember one of them coming to me and saying, "Michelle, thank you so much。
for trusting us.。
I mean, nobody in a million years would ask us to be on the worship team."。
And I just want to say, God will commission you when your heart loves him.。
He shows no partiality.。
And at the same time, let us learn from him, too.。
Raise up more people.。
Different people can serve in different positions.。
So come forward.。
This is a recruitment process, I think.。
Come forward when that is in your heart.。
So tonight, I just wanted all of us to see how Jesus accepted Mary Magdalene.。
She was someone with a past, a female, someone of lower status.。
And yet Jesus accepted her.。
Jesus kept her close.。
Jesus empathized with her sorrow.。
And Jesus commissioned her, the very first person.。
And when she was commissioned, you know what that did?。
It was telling the disciples as well, and the whole world to us, that she is no lesser。
than anybody else.。
So that even when he were to be in heaven and not physically be on earth, that they。
would treat her as an equal.。
So rather you have failed an exam or didn't get to a school or didn't graduate, or you。
grew up in a single parent home, or you have been battling with illness, whether it's mentally。
or physically, or if you have went through a divorce or if you're going through one,。
if you have struggles with your kids or finances or finding a job, please, don't let that。
stop you from feeling the acceptance of God.。
You are not defined by these things.。
And I have to say it again.。
You are not defined by these things.。
You are defined by the fact that you are a daughter and a son of God.。
You are a son and a daughter of the living God.。
And that's your definition.。
And so I pray that we will, in times of when we feel unsure or in doubt, reach out to God.。
Let his acceptance fill you up.。
And at the same time, accept the people around us.。
Now in a moment, we're going to sing a response song called "You Say."。
And one line really catches my attention, which is, "Am I really just the sum of my。
highs and lows?"。
What is your value?。
How are you defined?。
Let us define not by what other people say, not even how you view yourself, but what God。
says about you.。
And he says he loves you, he accepts you, and he'll continue to be with you until the。
end of time.。
Let us pray together.。
Dear Heavenly Father, we don't know how you can love us this way.。
I think it is because you made us.。
You made us.。
And you love us despite our flaws, our imperfections, and even our sins have been taken care of。
with the blood of Jesus.。
What more can we ask for from a God?。
And so Father, I pray that, especially for those who are hurting, who don't feel accepted,。
that Father, may your Spirit fill us up.。
It doesn't matter what people say.。
It only matters what you say.。
Father, may we hold on to that and also extend that acceptance to the people around us.。
In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.。
