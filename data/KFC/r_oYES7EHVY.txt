- Good evening, everyone.。
- Good evening.。
- Oh, thank you.。
(laughs)。
So today, as John says, we are going to be wrapping up。
the series of Women in the Old Testament.。
Now, I've really enjoyed it because I can see。
how God can work with both the godly women。
as well as those, well, that are slightly less.。

Now, if Bathsheba was seducing the king,。
because we do have two schools of thought,。
then the lesson is obvious.。
Well, don't tempt others in sexual matters,。
or cause others to stumble.。
Now, if the other camp of people,。
if Bathsheba was a victim,。
and had actually been kind of dragged in。
by David's sexual temptation and sin,。
then we would sympathize with her.。
And instead, we'll think about,。
how is it that she could find ways to protect herself。
from becoming a victim?。
So rather you're on one camp or the other,。
the lessons seem to point at the same direction,。
which is that we need to become more spiritually alert。
in sexual temptation matters.。
And how do we, how can we do that?。
Well, for example, I mean,。
it's quite hot now in summers, right?。
And it's easy for us ladies to want to be in our tank tops,。
shorts and mini skirts, and even like tight clothings.。
And as innocent as it may be,。
the truth be told, it does open a small door。
for some people to fall into a temptation.。
And we might unknowingly become a victim.。
And if we're still single, for those who are,。
I mean, we don't want to be attracting the wrong kind of man, right?。
So we'll definitely become a victim of the wrong kind of man.。
Or so we need to learn how to protect ourselves.。
Now in similar ways for those who are married,。
or who are dating and having this one-on-one meeting。
with the opposite gender,。
may also open doors to possible affairs and other relationships.。
So as innocent as some of them might start off,。
if one or both of them are struggling with their current relationship,。
it's very easy that we'll slip out a line or two,。
"Oh, things are not working out, it's going bad,"。
and the other person will kindly comfort you.。
And so that could lead us into sexual immorality as well.。
Or if you're dating, it's easy to be in a private room。
where it's just the two of you,。
and also easy to become a victim,。
or be a stumbling block to someone.。
And there are many other ways that we can think of。
where we could protect ourselves better。
so that we don't become a victim accidentally,。
or like this, it might be just an innocent situation.。
Now I once dated, I mean, yes, I once dated,。
a long-distance boyfriend who was a pastor-to-be,。
and he was interning at a church in his last year.。
And one time he told me he's celebrating a birthday dinner。
with a lady who was in her 50s,。
and the lady had two children already in their 20s.。
So even though I thought, you know, it's a little bit odd。
that it's a one-on-one kind of celebration,。
I wasn't very comfortable, but I just thought to myself,。
"Well, what are the chances that something would happen?"。
So I just kind of brushed it off.。
So after a few months,。
I had discovered that they had sexual relations.。
And eventually, I broke it off.。
I mean, I was shocked in every way,。
just because of who he was about to be,。
and also the fact that I've already quit my job at that time,。
and I was planning or already purchased a ticket to go there。
so that we would date in person.。
And so ever since then,。
my spiritual awareness for sexual temptations had heightened,。
and I would take it to the highest caution in this area.。
And whenever now, when I catch myself saying,。
"Well, what are the chances of that happening?"。
I would just say, "All right, let me just pause and let me re-evaluate.。
Is there more that I could do。
so that I don't become a victim。
or I don't become a stumbling block for someone?"。
And if there is, I wanted to take it to the highest level,。
just like Uriah right here.。
He wasn't thinking about all this.。
He just wanted his devotion to God.。
And I think in the same way,。
we need to have this kind of devotion to God。
in sexual temptation or these matters.。
Now, I want to kind of sidetrack a little bit。
because it's a very, very good point,。
is that, well, after Bathsheba was pregnant。
and she gave birth to a son,。
God had to put him to death。
because David did what was evil in God's eyes.。
And after David repented,。
he made love to Bathsheba again.。
Now, this time she was his wife.。
And she had given birth, and the son is called?。
Solomon, that's correct.。
You guys get another point, so that's two points for you guys.。
And the Lord loved him.。
And he would become the successor of King David.。
Now, I just want to pause here.。
I just want to emphasize。
that when the Lord said he would blot out our sins,。
he really means it.。
I mean, sometimes I would think about, you know,。
if I were God, of course I would never be,。
but if I were, you know, of all of the wives that David has,。
I would not choose Bathsheba to be the next king.。
Not the next king, but the mother of the next king.。
I would choose anybody but her.。
But it just shows to see how merciful our God is.。
And when he says he forgives, he really forgives.。
And so if there's any one of us here, you know,。
who's struggling with something that we've committed before,。
and we feel like we're sinful even after you've repented,。
well, please go back to the story。
and just see how merciful and forgiving God is.。
So now let us continue.。
Now, as we read on, Bathsheba reappears now。
in 1 King 1, where King David was dying.。
And the next in line on the throne is,。
I won't ask you this one, this one's kind of hard,。
is Adon--oh, how do I pronounce?。
Adonisia, Adonisia, yeah.。
I try to memorize it a few times.。
So by default, he would be the next king。
if King David didn't do anything,。
because he was the next in line.。
So he was gathering his supporters and saying,。
"Come, you know, I will be the next king."。
But some people didn't join,。
and he was going to do it in a way that would make him official。
by sacrificing animals and having him anointed by someone.。
So here is the account in verse 11.。
Oh, this is when Nathan went to Bathsheba。
after these has happened.。
And Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon's mother,。
"Have you not heard that Adonisia, the son of Haggith,。
has become king, and our Lord David knows nothing about it?"。
Remember, David's now old and dying on his bed.。
"And now then, let me advise you.。
How can you save your own life and the life of your son Solomon?"。
So Bathsheba followed Nathan's instruction.。
He goes to the king and tells him about it.。
And Nathan said that he would appear in the middle of the conversation。
so that he could also tell the king what has been happening.。
And so Bathsheba did just that.。
And this is a chart that I want to show you.。
Okay, so on the left side,。
those are the things that Nathan told Bathsheba to say.。
And on the right hand side was all that Bathsheba said.。
And so the yellow highlights are all the extra pieces of information。
that she has given.。
So while they were still talking, Nathan appeared as promised.。
And King David put an order for Solomon to be king。
by riding on his mule, which represented that his throne is given to him,。
and to be anointed by Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet。
as king over Israel.。
Now, so from these texts, I know it's hard to see these texts,。
but from what we've just talked about,。
I mean, what can we tell about Bathsheba?。
All right, this is another question for a point.。
Was she clueless about what was going on before Nathan went to her?。
Was she clueless?。
If she is clueless, put up your hand.。
Okay, nobody put up.。
If she's not clueless, put up your hand.。
Oh, there, a few of you guys got a point.。
There you go.。
And the ones that you did not put up, well, I think you were still thinking about it.。
And yes, and you are correct for those that put your hands up.。
Well, because she was able to give so much more information,。
it meant that she was actually following the entire process。
and what had been happening with Edenesia.。
Now, why is this piece of information important?。
Well, because it showed that even though she knew all along。
that King David and God wanted Solomon to be the next king,。
she did nothing about it until prophet Nathan went to her.。
So what we see is that prophet Nathan was very clear。
about what God was doing.。
Not only did he not mingle with Edenesia,。
but he actually went to advise Bathsheba.。
She's like, "Bathsheba, don't you know this?。
Go to the king."。
So he took active action in what was God's will,。
unlike Bathsheba, who her spiritual alertness was a lot slower.。
So now this brings us to our second point.。
What we can learn from Bathsheba is that we need to be。
spiritually alert for God's will.。
Now, even if all the guards of David and all the officials,。
even if they didn't say one word,。
but who was Bathsheba at that time?。
The wife of David.。
So he should have gone and told him,。
"Oh my goodness, this is all that's happening.。
Do something about it."。
But she didn't.。
Rather, it was for fear to be in front of a king,。
which doesn't seem to be in here.。
We don't know.。
But if prophet Nathan had not appeared and advised her,。
it seemed like she wouldn't have done anything.。
And sometimes, aren't we like Bathsheba as well?。
It's like we have received and we kind of know what God wants us to do.。
But for one thing or another, we're like, "Oh, you know, maybe I won't do it.。
Maybe I'll do it next week or next year."。
And we just kind of brush it off and we don't even pay attention to it.。
But we could instead be like Nathan,。
taking charge and going forward,。
even strategizing.。
For him, Nathan actually went to Bathsheba first before going to King David,。
because he wanted to be going into God's will.。
Now, going back to my earlier sharing about the ex-boyfriend.。
Now, at that time, I was going to leave Hong Kong, right?。
Because that's where my ex-boyfriend was.。
Well, I was actually studying seminary already at that time.。
And even though my calling wasn't 100% clear yet,。
but I knew God had put a passion in me to preach and to teach.。
But I just thought, "Well, you know what? I don't really need to be a pastor.。
Maybe I can be a pastor's wife. That sounds pretty good."。
And I can be flipping burgers for fellowship meetings.。
That sounds a lot better than going up on stage。
and having to struggle through the sermon, right?。
Sounds pretty good.。
But I was really glad that God had put a pause in what I thought,。
even though I knew and God put the passion in my heart.。
And I was even into seminary,。
that I was going to skew away from what I believe is God's calling。
and His direction for me.。
And so I just felt like I was spiritually slow in following God.。
But if I had been like Nathan,。
I would have been clear with my direction。
and I would have continued with what I believe God was putting in my heart.。
And it might be the same with us.。
I mean, are we aware of what God is doing in our lives at time?。
I mean, why has God put you in your company。
or put you in the relationship that you're in?。
I mean, why does God allow you to meet some of maybe the top guns in Hong Kong?。
Or why does God allow you to meet the poorest of the country, of our city?。
And what is it that God wants us to do?。
And if we have that spiritual alertness,。
we would actually go forward with what it is that He's telling us.。
So now let us read on.。
In the next chapter is 1st King, chapter 2.。
So after Solomon has become king,。
Adonijah went to Bathsheba to ask for the hand of Abishag.。
You're like, who is this?。
So this was the lady or the known as the concubine。
who was serving King David when he was dying.。
And even though they never had sexual relations,。
but to the outsider, she was the concubine.。
And so in this account, let's read, I will read it to you.。
In verse 13, Bathsheba asked him, which is Adonijah,。
"Do you come peacefully?"。
He answered, "Yes, peacefully."。
Then he added, "I have something to say to you."。
"You may say it," she replied.。
"As you know," he said, "the kingdom was mine.。
All Israel looked to me as their king, but things have changed.。
And the kingdom has now gone to my brother,。
for it has come from him, from the Lord.。
Now I have one request to make to you.。
Do not refuse me. You may make it," she says.。
So he continued, "Please ask King Solomon.。
He will not refuse you to give me Abishag,。
the Sunamite, as my wife."。
"Very well," Bathsheba replied.。
"I will speak to the king for you."。
So she goes to King Solomon and asks accordingly,。
just like Adonijah's request.。
But she kind of used her own way.。
So how she did it is in verse 20.。
You know, it goes to King Solomon,。
"I have just this one small request to make to you."。
So she says, "Do not refuse me."。
And the king, before knowing what it is, says,。
"Make it, my mother. I will not refuse you."。
And so she requests for Abishag,。
which to be married to Adonijah.。
Wow, these names are really hard to read.。
King Solomon responded harshly.。
He said to her, "Well, isn't that equivalent。
to giving him my entire kingdom?"。
Now, as such, Solomon put Adonijah to death on that day.。
Now at first, clans would be like, "What? Why?。
You're just asking for a concubine.。
Like, why do you have to put him to death and all this?"。
Well, actually, in the ancient world,。
Adonijah's request to marry Abishag was actually a revolt.。
Because to be seen with the king's concubine。
meant that he had already obtained political control.。
And so if it actually happens,。
then the rivals for all of King Solomon。
would come against him and challenge the king.。
And so what we see is that。
Bathsheba was insensitive to the political situation.。
She bought into Adonijah's word that he came in peace.。
And she believed his words when he called Solomon,。
"Oh, he's my king, the brother."。
Oh, and he even acknowledged that all of this happened because of God.。
And so, because he had been plotting this throne。
since the last chapter,。
she should have known better。
that whatever this guy is up to is probably not a good thing.。
And she should have taken a grain of salt,。
or even consult with Solomon,。
or even the prophet before taking action.。
And she had no obligation, right?。
To say yes to his request.。
And yet she does.。
So on the contrary, what do we see。
is that Solomon instead displayed a kind of discernment。
that Bathsheba lacked.。
I mean, even though he has agreed and said,。
"Okay, yes, I will agree to everything,。
or I will not refuse you."。
But at this critical moment,。
knowing that he'll have to give up his entire kingdom,。
he actually put a pause and said, "No, I cannot."。
And of course, the mother is kind of tricking him into it,。
because she said a small request.。
But this was not a small request.。
And so what we see is that Solomon displayed。
a spiritual alertness to discern.。
And so this would bring us to our third point,。
which is we can learn from Bathsheba。
that we need to be spiritually alert to discern.。
Now, she obviously lacked discernment。
about Adonijah's intention and mistaken it。
he had come in peace.。
She did not use her power wisely,。
but she kind of tricked her son。
and wanted him to agree with what she wanted.。
And so this might be very similar to us.。
I mean, sometimes we might lack discernment as well.。
I mean, some people can come to us saying,。
"Yes, I am a good person."。
I don't actually hear people say that,。
but they display it this way.。
Or they might actually display that,。
"Oh, you need to date a Christian?。
I'm a Christian," you know, and make that claim.。
And we need to be discerning.。
And also, maybe we have these businessmen。
that we need to work with,。
and they could display themselves。
as someone who's fair and doing good,。
but in fact, they're not.。
And so going back to my earlier experience that I shared,。
now, even after I realized that my ex-boyfriend。
had sexual relations with the older lady。
and to a point where police was involved,。
now, I still thought about staying with him。
because I thought, "Well, isn't that what the Bible said?。
Like, to love, to forgive?"。
And it wasn't until my mom,。
when I was talking to her on the phone about this,。
and she literally yelled at me, saying,。
"Will you just stop doing things your way?"。
And I still remember, you know, holding that phone.。
I'm like, "Ah, I'm going to press that button。
and cut your line," you know?。
You know how we are when we're mad at our mothers, right?。
Cut.。
Well, they do the same thing when they're mad at you, right?。
So that's what I did.。
I was like, "Well, what do you know?"。
However, you know, that --。
her voice, that sentence kept on ringing back.。
And I just -- I just started to think,。
and I really thank God for opening。
my spiritual discernment and awareness。
because she wasn't talking about what I was thinking.。
She was thinking about the integrity of this person。
certainly has problems,。
and you need to choose correctly.。
And so, as I was thinking, you know,。
I just thought about how much my mother loves me.。
She always wanted the best for me,。
and God has placed her around me。
to guard me and to support me and to bless me.。
So I listened to her.。
And three months after I broke up with him,。
when all the emotions subsided, all the infatuations,。
and I just want to say,。
that was the best decision I've ever made.。
Of course, the best one is probably getting married with Philemon,。
but actually --。
actually, the best one might be believing in God, okay?。
So anyways, it's top there, you know,。
top three, top five decisions.。
And we may have spiritual blindness ourselves at times, don't we?。
And it's important for us to keep our ears open,。
especially to opposing voices.。
And if those opposing voices come from your loved ones,。
like your parents, your sons, your daughters,。
your best friends, your mentors, take those.。
I mean, I'm not saying just blindly take them,。
but really slow down, think about it, evaluate it.。
If you're not sure and you're having emotional, you know,。
hard time with it, speak with someone else,。
pray together about it.。
Because a lot of times we do have spiritual blindness。
and we might not have the discernment,。
just like Bathsheba.。
But God is gracious.。
He will put people around us, just like Solomon, you know,。
he would come in and say, "This is the right thing to do."。
And so in conclusion today, I just wanted to say。
that we need to learn Bathsheba's story.。
Is that we need to live a life with spiritual alertness.。
Now you might think in your head,。
"Well, you know, even though she didn't have it,。
she did end up to be the wife of King David.。
And also she was the mother, Queen Mother of Solomon."。
And actually it doesn't seem so bad, you know,。
maybe like we're secretly like envying her, right?。
But that would only be true if we're focused on the temporal.。
I mean, if I have to stretch that, well,。
then I might as well lie and cheat and seduce。
to get our ways up, right?。
Of course, I'm not saying Bathsheba was like that,。
but I mean, if I have to stretch that point.。
Now, if we're looking,。
and I'm sure we are since we're sitting here today。
and also online, is that we are looking。
for matters in the eternal.。
And God will remember us when we do things His way。
in faith in Him.。
And I want to share that in Matthew chapter one,。
where the genealogy of Jesus was listed,。
starting from Abraham and the list down.。
And in verse five and six,。
if I highlighted these two verses, it says,。
"Salmon," not the swimming salmon, but the guy salmon,。
"the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab,。
Boaz, the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth,。
Obed, the father of Jesse,。
and Jesse, the father of King David.。
David was the father of Solomon," notice here,。
"whose mother had been Uriah's wife."。
Notice that Bathsheba, her name nor her work was recorded.。
Now we might say, well, you know, she had a husband before.。
Well, so did Ruth.。
And actually Rahab had probably more than one man in her life.。
But notice that their names was remembered in eternity by God.。
And so it matters to us that we just live our greatest devotion to God.。
And if we want to be remembered by God as well,。
now I'm not saying that God would love us any less。
because just like the songs that we sang, we know how much God loves us.。
But this is a matter of devoting ourselves to the highest level。
for the God that deserves it。
and for the one God that we love.。
And so from Bathsheba, how can we have spiritual awareness that honors God?。
Well, first, it is to safeguard ourselves from sexual temptations.。
So when the Holy Spirit speaks to us,。
I use this, but it probably doesn't happen like this.。
But when the Holy Spirit speaks to us about how we should dress,。
who we should not be alone with, or how to talk to the opposite sex,。
would we uphold the highest standard like Uriah to safeguard ourselves。
so we don't become a victim and we don't become a stumbling block。
so that we could honor God that way?。
And secondly, in the area of following God's will,。
and when the Holy Spirit, I'm doing this again,。
the Holy Spirit reminds us of what He's doing in our lives.。
You know, rather it's full-time ministry or to be salt and light in your workplace。
or leading, or actually volunteering at church or spreading the gospel.。
Would we then just follow that lead, just like Prophet Nathan,。
acting in the will of God?。
And thirdly, in the area of spiritual discernment,。
maybe Holy Spirit reminds us of our blindness, our stubbornness,。
or us wanting our own ways,。
but He might put people around us to remind us.。
Would we stop for a moment and listen, evaluate, pray over them,。
and listen to what God wants us to do?。
And we can choose to be spiritually alert,。
or we can just live our life randomly.。
And I pray that it would be all of us who will live。
just the highest devotion for our God, because He's worthy of it all.。
So let Holy Spirit continue to guide us in these three areas.。
And really, today if there was any part that for a moment。
it was like speaking to you and you're like, "Nah, it's probably not me,"。
or, "What are the chances?"。
I hope that you would just take a moment to pray over it,。
especially with someone that you trust,。
to really seek and see if God is saying something to you.。
So let's respond with our hearts,。
and we pray that God's Spirit would open our eyes。
so that our spiritual blindness will be teared down。
and that we can have the awareness.。
We pray that God's presence would fill us to change us.。
So let's pray together.。
Dear Heavenly Father, we pray with all our hearts。
that our lives would just not wander away and just let it pass by.。
We pray, dear Heavenly Father, that we would give you the highest devotion,。
that we would safeguard ourselves from sexual matters,。
that we will follow your will,。
and that we would have discernment in all that we do, Father.。
We pray that your Holy Spirit would give us spiritual alertness and awareness。
so that everything that we do。
would be the most God-honoring action and words that we say.。
In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.。
