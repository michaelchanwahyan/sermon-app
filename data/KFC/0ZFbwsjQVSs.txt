>> Thank you very much.。
I feel quite overwhelmed.。
This will be my last KFCI Saturday afternoon sermon.。
Not my last sermon, I assure you.。
But nonetheless, it holds a very special significance for Sandra and I.。
And I'm so glad that it comes in this Seeing the Heart of Jesus series.。
When we first decided on this series, I had no idea it would be my last in this role.。
It was meant just as a genuine follow-up from our Serving the Community series.。
But for me, things move fast in Hong Kong.。
I've been so grateful for all six of our speakers in this series, and feel doubly honored to。
bring this week's talk on A Heart That Forgives.。
As we look at Jesus and the woman caught in adultery.。
I am so excited, James.。
I'm so excited for the new English service and the new location.。
I love you all to get 100% behind Pastor James, Christina, and the team.。
One promise, Sandra and I will be your biggest cheerleaders.。
This week I've really wrestled, I've toiled.。
I've grasped to find something I wanted to leave you with.。
Something that would hopefully carry you through the rest of your lives and indeed into eternity.。
Something you might look back on and say, "Yeah, Pastor John taught us this."。
I got my answer in the unlikely shape of a new song.。
No, I'm not going to sing.。
Done that.。
Just a few weeks ago I came across a brand new song by Phil Wickham.。
We sing a lot of Phil Wickham songs here.。
This is Amazing Grace, Living Hope, Hymn of Heaven, etc.。
It's called The Jesus Way, and it reflects so much of what we have been hearing here。
week after week during this Seeing the Heart of Jesus series.。
Phil Wickham could have written it for this series and especially tonight's sermon.。
Just look at some of the words.。
I've put them on the screen.。
If you curse me, then I will bless you.。
If you hurt me, I will forgive.。
If you hate me, then I will love you.。
I choose the Jesus way.。
If you're helpless, I will defend you.。
If you're burdened, I'll share the weight.。
If you're hopeless, then let me show you.。
There's hope in the Jesus way.。
I follow Jesus.。
I follow Jesus.。
He wore my sin.。
I gladly bear his name.。
I love that line.。
He is the treasure.。
He is the answer.。
Oh, I choose the Jesus way.。
The Jesus way.。
My prayer is that when we look back on these past seven years, we would all say the one。
thing that we learned together was to do things the Jesus way.。
But we were not unduly influenced by church culture, prevailing trends in the church,。
or by how people expected us to be.。
But we tried our very best, and not always succeeding, of course.。
But we tried our very best to be the hands and feet of the Lord Jesus and demonstrated。
His heart in all we've done.。
So before tonight's passage, I want you to watch the lyric video.。
And as you watch it, open your heart to the words that you're about to hear.。
And as you hear them, I pray that you will resolve to follow Jesus in faith and obedience。
and choose the Jesus way.。
Let's watch the video.。
If you curse me, then I will bless you.。
If you hurt me, then I will heal you.。

Does this event seem to be consistent with the heart and attitude of Jesus as he is portrayed through the gospel?。
And my answer is a resounding yes.。
It is an embodiment.。
It is a powerful expression of the Jesus way.。
And yet it starts off with a fishing story.。
What? You say what?。
Now, me and fishing do not get on.。
I've got to tell you this.。
I do not have sea legs. I get seasick on the Star Ferry.。
On the other hand, my son Matt, who lives in Saicong, tries to get out and go fishing every morning.。
But it wasn't his dad that taught him.。
It was his mom.。
But what I do know about fishing is this.。
Bait is an important part of fishing.。
Now, why am I saying this?。
My friends, this woman was bait.。
Fish bait.。
The teachers and the Pharisees wanted to trap Jesus and were willing to see this woman put to death in order to get to him.。
Let's read it.。
At dawn, he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.。
The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery.。
They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery."。
In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.。
Now, what do you say?。
They were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him.。
The trap is set.。
The setting is, it is early morning.。
We read in verse 2, "At dawn, and Jesus has come into the temple to teach."。
We read a crowd gathered as one might have expected, given the news of Jesus' teaching had spread widely.。
This is one of the reasons the authorities were after him.。
And we can imagine the scene of the crowd intently listening to Jesus,。
when all of a sudden, there was a kerfuffle.。
I like that word. I've never used that in a sermon before. I'll use it again.。
There was a kerfuffle at the back of the room.。
Imagine the scene of the crowd intently listening to Jesus.。
Slowly, the crowd parts, and a woman being dragged forward by the officially robed scribes and Pharisees is thrust before Jesus.。
Imagine the scene. Them in their robes, and her clothes all over the place, and looking a real mess.。
Why? Because she had just been caught in adultery.。
Dragged from her bed, she became fish bait. The objective, to trap Jesus.。
"Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery."。
"In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women."。
"Now what do you say?"。
"This woman had committed a capital offence."。
"And it's important to note that neither Jesus, nor the woman refutes, denies the charge against her."。
"She is guilty."。
Full stop.。
"And the law states, the penalty is death by stoning."。
You can see, can't you, that Jesus is faced with the ultimate dilemma.。
Here is the dilemma. How does God balance his justice and his mercy?。
If God is a God of righteousness, and a God of justice, and a God of judgment by his holy nature, she must die.。
If God is a God of love, and a God of grace, and a God of kindness, and mercy, and forgiveness, she must live.。
How can he be a God of justice, and forgive sin?。
How can he be a God of love, and punish sin?。
A dilemma is when you have two options, and no matter what you select, you're in trouble.。
Option one, show mercy and compassion to this woman, and demand she be set free.。
But if he does so, he will be seen as defying the law of Moses, and risk discrediting his teaching and ministry.。
Option two, order her execution by stoning, and affirm his allegiance to Moses' law.。
But actually, only the Roman government was allowed to execute capital punishment.。
And if Jesus orders the woman's death, he is in violation to Rome, and could potentially be handed over to the authorities, and even executed himself.。
Either way, he's in trouble.。
Either with Israel, or with Rome. It's like tossing a coin.。
Heads he loses, tails he loses.。
But let's look at the real truth here.。
The context. And for that, we need to go back to the previous chapter, the night before this event.。
I want to read this to you.。
"Finally, the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked him, 'Why didn't you bring him in?'。
'No one ever spoke the way this man does,' the guards replied.。
'You mean, as he deceived you also?' the Pharisees retorted.。
'Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in him?'。
'No, but this mob that knows nothing of the law, there is a curse on them.'"。
The scene here. They were meeting in secret.。
"They had ordered the temple police to arrest Jesus and bring him to them.。
But instead, the guards were mesmerized by Jesus' teaching.。
They said, 'No one's ever spoken the way this man does.'。
That was their reply to the question, 'Why didn't you bring him in?'。
Hence, the trap.。
And they conveniently manipulate the law to trap Jesus.。
Look at this. Deuteronomy 22.。
"If a man is found sleeping with another man's wife,。
both the man who slept with her and the woman must die."。
You must purge evil from Israel.。
Verse 24. "You shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death."。
Now the obvious question here is, where is the man?。
They were going to uphold the law, right?。
But where was the man? He was supposed to be punished.。
They're not interested in upholding the law.。
They're only interested in trapping Jesus.。
Apparently, the religious leaders were not only willing to let this woman be stoned to death。
in order to attract Jesus.。
They were also willing to let some unidentified, unattested Jewish man。
to commit the sin of adultery so that they would have some bait in the trap they were setting for Jesus.。
Their aim was simple. Destroy Jesus.。
And they were happy to have a man's adultery ignored。
and a woman killed to accomplish their goals.。
How would Jesus react at this blatant attempt to manipulate justice?。
What would be the Jesus way?。
Look at this. This is brilliant.。
"But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger."。
Just imagine the scene. I wish I'd been there.。
The crowd are holding their breath.。
They're waiting for Jesus' response.。
But he doesn't speak to the woman. He doesn't speak to the accusers.。
Instead, he stoops down and writes in the dirt at his feet.。
Now, the great question that scholars have wrestled with over the years is。
what exactly did Jesus write in the sand?。
Some believe he was writing the Pharisees' names and possibly their sins.。
This theory is based primarily on Jeremiah 17.13.。
"Those who depart from me shall be written in the earth。
because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters."。
In the preceding chapter of John, Jesus spoke of himself as living water.。
So perhaps he was fulfilling a prophecy.。
Others believe it was to demonstrate, as God the Father did。
when he carved the Ten Commandments in stone with his finger,。
that Jesus had the authority to issue two new commandments。
for us to love God and love one another.。
We don't know for sure what Jesus was writing.。
Nor do we know who saw his message.。
I'd like to think that once the crowd had dispersed。
and he was left to deal with the woman himself,。
he'd have written only one other word, "forgiven."。
But who knows?。
So then, after writing in the dirt, what is his response?。
Let's read his response.。
Verse 7, "When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them,。
'Let any one of you who was without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.'。
Again he stooped down and wrote in the ground.。
At this, those who heard began to go away, one at a time,。
the elder ones first, until only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there."。
Friends, this is the game changer.。
We read, "The leaders kept on questioning him."。
They wouldn't let up.。
In my mind, they keep on hammering the question.。
What do you say we do with this adulterous woman?。
Do we stone her? What do you say?。
Maybe they were throwing out more challenges and taunts.。
Answer us, prophet.。
What does your father have to say, son of God?。
Mobs have a tendency to get louder and more aggressive.。
Maybe there was some pushing and shoving.。
There is no other way to describe this except as an ugly scene.。
But before they know what happens,。
the Bible tells us that Jesus straightens up and takes control of the situation.。
He changes the rules of the game in 18 words,。
maybe in less than 10 seconds.。
Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.。
Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.。
Suddenly the issue is not about Jesus' credibility or the woman's guilt.。
Jesus turns the table by making the issue about who is and who is not qualified to judge another human being.。
The issue is not the standard.。
The benchmark has moved from one not committing the sin of adultery to one who is without sin.。
Which, by the way, is why God alone is qualified to judge sins in human beings.。
By the way, some of us would do well to remember that.。
What Jesus is saying is this.。
This is God's business, not yours.。
You don't even have a right to bring up the issue.。
And so the charade of religious righteousness has been exposed。
because they know they can't claim utter sinlessness.。
These men who are happy to destroy, entrap, and judge others sink away in embarrassment,。
dropping their stones, ready to plot other ways to destroy Jesus.。
At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time.。
The older ones first, until only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there.。
Only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there.。
Now let's look at how Jesus completes the rescue.。
Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"。
"No one, sir," she said. "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared.。
"Go now and leave your life of sin."。
Now put yourself in the woman's place.。
She's been caught with her hands in the proverbial cookie jar.。
She has been publicly charged and is genuinely guilty.。
And now she has a one-on-one with Jesus.。
But how will he respond to her?。
He basically says to her, "Woman, where are those accusers of yours?"。
"No one has condemned you. If no one wants to prosecute, the trial is over."。
And my friends, three things.。
Condemnation, correction, and compassion are the issues here.。
Firstly, the Jesus way is not condemnation.。
He says, "Then neither do I condemn you."。
But note the Jesus way is correction.。
"Go now and leave your life of sin."。
This is important and should not be ignored.。
But above all, the Jesus way is compassion.。
For the first time in probably a long time, someone views her as a person, not a thing.。
For the first time in probably a long time, someone interacts with her。
with a real concern for her well-being and not for his selfish ends.。
For the first time in probably a long time, she feels the warmth of compassion,。
albeit with strict words of discipline and correction,。
and remembers what it feels like to be a human being.。
I think she was going to live out the rest of her life doing what she could。
to please Jesus because of the gratitude that she had in her heart.。
In conclusion, the two most popular words in any sermon.。
In conclusion, if I had to sum up the Jesus way in one word,。
I'd use grace.。
I'd use grace.。
I hope, I pray, when we look back on these past seven years of Saturday afternoons,。
that what we would have experienced at the center of this service。
is exactly that, grace.。
Jesus' interaction with this woman, she was more accustomed to being used than being loved,。
is a powerful reminder that our lives, both past and present,。
I love this, I'll put it on the screen,。
the product of our past needs to be resolved in our present to secure our future.。
Screenshot that, well done.。
The product of our past needs to be resolved in our present to secure our future.。
And the key behind that resolution is the grace of our Lord.。
He deals directly with her problems and then directs her towards a future。
that is pointed towards life and away from the self-destructed habits of the past.。
Grace is the heart of God that loves people.。
And nowhere is grace seen so clearly than in the life of this someone who knows undeservedness.。
I wonder if we are grateful for what Jesus has done for us.。
I want to call you, I want to call the church, the one church.。
Many of us have grown up in churches where it seems the law of Moses。
seems more important than the grace of Jesus.。
Rules, rules, rules, rules, rules.。
I remember meeting with two pastors after a tragic high-profile suicide。
and asking the question, "Was she a Christian?"。
I was given the answer, "She was a lesbian."。
That response absolutely broke my heart.。
My friends, choose the Jesus way.。
See the heart of Jesus and use it as your compass.。
If you are here tonight and you are not following Jesus,。
I want to say to you, I'm sorry for the Jesus that we as Christians at times have shown you.。
The headmaster wanting to punish your mistakes.。
I invite you to be like this woman and run into his arms.。
Experience his love, his forgiveness and grace.。
To surrender your life to him right here, right now.。
As I ask the band to return, please Paul.。
I leave my final words to Phil Wickham.。
This is what he says in that song.。
"And I choose surrender. I choose to love.。
Oh God my Savior, you'll always be enough.。
I choose forgiveness. I choose grace.。
I choose to worship no matter what I face.。
I choose the Jesus way." Let's stand.。
I'd love to pray for you.。
I just wonder if you just stretch your hands in front of you.。
It's not a religious thing. Sometimes we do in church to say,。
"I'm open to receive what God has for me."。
And if there's anyone here who hasn't received Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior,。
I want to give you an opportunity right here and now。
to choose forgiveness, to choose grace.。
We can look at this woman, but we've all done things wrong.。
But she was able to run into the arms of Jesus.。
If you just say this prayer in your heart, "Lord Jesus,。
I come to you now for forgiveness. I receive your grace.。
I'm a sinner in need of forgiveness. I choose grace.。
I receive your love for me. Forgive my sins and come into my life right now."。
And if you've prayed that prayer, please tell someone before you leave tonight。
and get them to pray for you.。
And for the rest of us, I'm just going to pray now for the Holy Spirit just to come。
to fill us afresh.。
We know choosing the Jesus way is not easy.。
We can't do it on our own.。
We need each other.。
But we need, Lord, the power of your Spirit.。
As we sing this song together, Lord, I pray that you will show us.。
Show us the way forward so that we can say as a church,。
so that we can say as a church in this city, we chose the Jesus way.。
Let's worship God.。
