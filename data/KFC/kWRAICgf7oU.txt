(silence)。
Hello, Explorer!。
I know the pandemic is really bad in Hong Kong。
but I hope this sermon will encourage you。
to be a church of God。
to continue to serve and pursue God.。
We are now in Explorer。
talking about the Church series.。
Last week, Pastor Irene told us。
what the Church is.。
It's a fellowship of sinners.。
We all need Jesus to help us。
to be our Savior.。
Today, we are talking about what the Church is.。
Church as the fellowship of the saints.。
In the book of Colossians, Paul tells us。
"You have Jesus now.。
Jesus has nailed the cross for you to die.。
So what?。
We have accepted Jesus as our Savior.。
So what?。
We will not wear the old clothes.。
Do you like to wear the old clothes?。
The smelly clothes from the winter.。
The clothes from yesterday.。
Do you like to wear them?。
Of course not.。
They smell bad, right?。
Paul says, "Don't wear the old clothes.。
You have to wear new clothes.。
The old clothes are sins.。
What are they?。
They are sins, they are temptations.。
But Paul wants you to wear new clothes.。
New clothes are beautiful, right?。
Are they beautiful?。
These are not new.。
But Paul wants us to wear new clothes.。
What are new clothes?。
We will look at Colossians 3, verse 12-17.。
So you are the chosen ones of God, pure and unselfish people.。
You must wear the new clothes.。
Therefore, you are humble, gentle, and patient.。
If this person and that person have a grudge,。
they must be patient and forgive each other.。
The Lord has forgiven you,。
and you must also forgive him.。
In addition, you must wear the new clothes,。
because love is universal.。
You must let the peace that Christ bestows。
dwell in your hearts,。
and for this reason you must be one.。
You must also have a heart of gratitude.。
When you use all kinds of wisdom。
to enrich the heart with the truth of Christ,。
use the verses of Psalms, Psalms, and Psalms to teach each other,。
to advise each other,。
and to plant the heart of gratitude.。
Whatever you do,。
whatever you say or do,。
you must do it in the name of Jesus Christ.。
Wearing the new clothes is a way of being grateful.。
Yes, just now Paul told us。
"You put on"。
"Put on" these different things.。
He asked us what kind of people we are.。
We are God's chosen people.。
Right?。
We are holy.。
If there are so many people in the church。
who have accepted Jesus Christ,。
who are holy,。
then this is a very good place.。
Today I have seven points。
about what quality our church has.。
First, the church is a place where we treat each other。
as Christ does.。
Verse 12 says, "Put on then as God's chosen people,。
holy and beloved,。
compassionate hearts,。
kindness, humility, meekness, patience."。
Wow, if our church。
has compassionate hearts,。
kindness, humility, meekness, patience,。
isn't that a very good place?。
We see Jesus Christ,。
he sees those 5,000 people。
who are poor,。
who have nothing to eat,。
who are hungry,。
he has compassion towards them.。
He shows kindness towards them.。
He fed the 5,000.。
He sees those prostitutes,。
who are not liked by anyone,。
who want to throw stones at them,。
those adulterers,。
what does he do?。
He shows kindness towards them.。
Kindness towards them.。
First, the church is a place。
where we treat each other。
as Christ does.。
Second, the church is a place。
where we forgive one another.。
Verse 11, "Bearing with one another,。
if one has a complaint against another,。
forgive each other,。
as the Lord has forgiven you,。
so you also must forgive."。
Paul tells us,。
Jesus has forgiven us.。
God has forgiven us.。
He has nailed the cross for us.。
In the story,。
Jesus and the adulterer,。
everyone wants to throw him into the ground,。
because he committed a sin.。
Jesus tells him,。
"If you have no sin,。
you throw the stone."。
But what is the result?。
No one throws the stone.。
Why?。
Because everyone knows they have sinned.。
If they have no sin,。
they will throw the stone.。
He tells the adulteress woman,。
"Has anyone thrown the stone?"。
"No."。
"I will also forgive you."。
"Neither will I."。
"Go and leave your life of sin."。
Church is a place where everyone is a sinner.。
We all have to accept one another,。
and forgive one another.。
Third, church is a place where we love with unity.。
Love with unity.。
In verse 14, it says,。
"Above all these things, put on love,。
which binds everything together。
in perfect harmony."。
Love brings us together.。
Love helps us to accept one another.。
Love is the most important thing.。
God first loved us.。
We must love one another.。
Fourth, church is a place of peace.。
In verse 15, it says,。
"Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts."。
The peace of God, Jesus Christ,。
must rule in our lives.。
During this pandemic,。
do we have the peace of God, Jesus Christ?。
This peace will bring us together as one body.。
One body.。
Fifth, church is a place of thankfulness.。
Paul calls us to be thankful.。
When we are in church,。
when we are in the Explorer,。
do we have thankfulness?。
Do we have gratitude?。
God says, "Wow, we can be together,。
have a time of unity,。
read the Bible together,。
play together,。
have a time to pray together."。
When we are in church,。
do we have gratitude?。
Are we thankful?。
Sixth, what is church?。
Church is a place where the Word of God。
is the foundation.。
The Word of God is our foundation.。
We are in the Explorer,。
we read the Bible,。
we have sermons,。
we pray,。
everything,。
everything is the foundation of the Word of God.。
When we preach,。
what is our foundation?。
It's not our own inspiration.。
Our inspiration is the Word of God.。
We hope, we explore,。
the foundation,。
we worship,。
we sing,。
whatever we do,。
the foundation is the Word of God.。
Seventh,。
last,。
church is a place where everything is done for Christ.。
In verse 17 it says,。
"And whatever you do,。
in deed or word,。
do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus,。
giving thanks to God the Father through Him."。
We are in church,。
whatever we do,。
we do it for the name of Jesus.。
Jesus is for Jesus.。
Then we, in everything that we do,。
we must glorify God,。
worship Jesus.。
Then we recap,。
the church is a place where we treat each other as Christ does.。
Church is a place where we forgive one another.。
Church is a place where we love in unity.。
Church is a place of peace, of thankfulness.。
Church is a place where God's Word is the foundation.。
And the church is a place where everything is done for Jesus Christ.。
Wow, if we can do this kind of church,。
isn't it an amazing place?。
What a great place!。
Right?。
Now we will invite Sophia to share her experience.。
Hello everyone, I am Sophia.。
I am an intern at the church this year.。
I am 18 years old and I am studying in England.。
What I like most about the church is that。
we can strengthen our relationship with God in the church.。
Every Sunday we sing to God,。
and after listening to the sermon, we have a discussion.。
This is to prevent me from deviating from the path that God has chosen for me.。
And I think it is easier to make friends in the church than in school.。
I just finished saying that the church is a place where we treat others as Christ does.。
I think we all experience God's love without conditions.。
It is easier to have more love and care for others.。
And it is less judgmental.。
We can make the church great again.。
I think I can make more effort to improve my relationship with God.。
And I can pay more attention to others.。
We thank Sophia for her testimony.。
If we can do this at 7pm,。
isn't the church an amazing place?。
A great place.。
Now I have four points.。
How to make our church great again.。
Upward, inward, outward, downward.。
First, upward.。
We need to focus on our relationship with God.。
If we are closer to God,。
we will become more like Jesus.。
We can love those around us.。
Love those who are difficult.。
We can have compassion to care for others.。
Become more like Jesus.。
First, look upward.。
Second, look inward.。
We need to look at ourselves.。
We all have weaknesses.。
We all have different places that make us angry.。
We are very angry.。
We need to be aware of our weaknesses.。
Look inward.。
Third, we need to look at our weaknesses.。
What do we need to do?。
Look outward.。
We need to make a plan.。
When we run, we see a point.。
We have a focus.。
When we make a plan, we need to have a focus.。
We see our weaknesses.。
How can we take initiative to help our church?。
To love those around us.。
We need to have a plan to care for our church.。
Fourth, look downward.。
Look to give, not receive.。
John F. Kennedy told the United States,。
"Do not look to what your country can do for you,。
but look to what you can do for your country."。
We are the same in church.。
We don't always say, "Oh, what can the church give us?。
What can we take?"。
But if we are truly following Jesus,。
we will look to give to the church.。
Give to one another.。
We need to look downward.。
We need to see where our feet are going.。
We need to give our best to Jesus.。
To serve.。
To use our gifts to serve our church.。
I remember when I first entered college,。
I experienced a group at college.。
Wow, we went out to preach together.。
We cared for each other.。
We studied, we had many difficulties.。
We had relationships.。
We prayed for our friends.。
We served together.。
We organized fellowship campaigns at college.。
This was the first time I experienced。
an amazing fellowship.。
Church is an amazing place.。
I hope that we, as Explorers,。
can do this 7-point.。
To love one another.。
To forgive one another.。
To love one another.。
Church is a place of peace,。
of thankfulness.。
The Word of God is our foundation.。
And everything we do is for Jesus.。
God bless you.。
