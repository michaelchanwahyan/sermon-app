Good evening. How's everybody doing? Great. We're finishing up our series on Jesus,。
a heart that values. And who's enjoyed the series on the different stories of。
Jesus? Who's enjoyed them? Yeah? That's great. That's good. I'm once again。
teaching on the healing of a blind person. Now, I don't know why. Maybe John。
assigned me to really focus on the blind. But this is the second topic on a。
healing of the blind person. And as you might remember from the last sermon, the。
first blind person was healed with what process? You remember? It was spit,。
yes? And it was a two-step process. Right? Two-step process. He spit in his eyes and。
then it's like, "What do you see?" I see, you know, the the trees of green and red。
roses too. Right? And then he had to do it a second time. "Now what do you see?" Okay.。
Now I see clearly. This second one is a little bit different. Because the first。
person that we said, that we read about, the first blind person that we read。
about, we knew that he's seen before because of that. Right? What do you see?。
Well, I think I see people. I see trees or whatever that blind person said. But this。
man that we looked at, that Bonnie read for us beautifully, he was a man born。
blind. A man born blind. And the disciples right away, what do they say? "Rabbi, who。
sinned? The man or his parents?" Right away, the disciples play the blame game. Right?。
And our world is full of the blame game. Right? Countries like to blame other。
countries. Right? Trump loves to blame everybody. Right? Yeah, it's never my。
fault. Right? It's always that country or that person's fault. Trump never, you know,。
takes responsibility. Right? Paul likes to take responsibility, on the other hand.。
Right? For his marriage, for all the keys that go wrong, the guitar strings that...。
No, no, okay. Even in sports, right? You look at the interviews at the end. It's。
either, well, you know, Kobe's always like, it's on me. It's on my shoulders. I should。
have taken, you know, that fourth-quarter shot. I should have taken it to the rack.。
I should have won. Right? Whereas you have the other person, who's somebody。
who likes to blame somebody in sports. Never his fault. Maybe it's Embiid, right?。
He's like crying. It's Hardin's fault that we didn't advance. It's Kawhi Leonard's。
fault. It's the rim's fault because it bounced like ten times before it went in.。
Do you guys remember that miraculous shot with the blue tongue because he was。
drinking blue Gatorade? Blame versus responsibility. Look at the person beside。
you. Do they take blame or responsibility, you think? Huh?。
Somebody... It farted. Oh, who farted? It wasn't me. Somebody else's, right? Don't。
look at each other. You have plenty of time for that, Florence and Julian. So,。
healing of the blind, right? Mark 8, we saw the two-step process, and today we're。
gonna see the person that was born blind also be healed. Now, blindness back then, it。
wasn't uncommon, okay? It wasn't uncommon because it was very unsanitary. It。
wasn't as clean as it was now, if you jump to the blindness slide. Yeah, and what it。
meant for a blind person was that there was usually no careers, right? Have you。
have you guys been to Thailand, to Bangkok? In the airport, I saw a massage.。
Do you know who was doing the massage? Have you guys seen it? I think。
you... Yeah, you've seen it, right? In Thailand, I saw... Whoa, these blind people are。
giving people massages. That's really cool, right? There's a job for these。
people. But back then, in biblical times, in Jesus' time, it meant you had no job, and。
you relied on the goodness of people. And this beggar, in particularly, was at the。
temple, right? It was at the temple. And so, they were debating, they were debating。
whose fault was it that this man was born blind? Was it the parents, or was it。
the person born blind? Who thinks it was the parents? Who's to blame? Who... Anybody。
want to... If you had to choose one or the other, who would you choose? The parents,。
or the baby born blind? Who do you think would be more, legally speaking,。
responsible? Uncle Vincent, from a legal perspective, any...。
Any ideas? From a prosecutor's perspective, anything different? No? No.。
But these are the kind of discussions they like to have back then, okay?。
Now, in Jewish law, they had this law of retribution. The law of retribution.。
Anybody heard of it? The law of retribution? It states this, that the religious...。
Sorry, righteous, were blessed according to their righteousness. So, if you did。
well, if you were good, then you would be blessed. Makes sense, right? Sort of like a。
lot of the golden rules. Karma, you do good, and you know, and then good will be。
done unto you. Now, the wicked would be cursed according to their wickedness. If。
you do bad, then bad things would happen to you. So, this was, according to sort of。
their Jewish custom at the time, the way that they would explain the tragedies of。
life. That all life's difficulties were a judgment of sin. So, if something bad。
happened to you, right? Maybe you were born with a particular height,。
just for example, because we've been on this topic for a while. Somebody's to。
blame, alright? Somebody... I don't know who's to blame. Maybe it's your parents.。
Maybe it's you. Maybe you've done something bad in your past life. There...。
There was... Well, for a man being born blind,。
the parents could have been to blame. There were congenital blindness as。
result of sexually transmitted diseases back then. Because of unsanitary。
conditions, because of STDs, it could have been the parents. It made sense. The result。
of sin could have been blindness for the child. But if the blind man was to blame,。
how could he have been blamed for this? How could a blind man been。
born? What sin could he have done? I mean, he hasn't been born yet. And this was。
what the disciples were discussing here. So, there's three sort of。
key views that we see here. The first is the predestinarian view. Predestinarian。
view states this, that one is judged in advance for the sinful choices they。
would make later in life. So somehow, God knew that you were gonna do something。
bad in your future. And so he judged you, he prejudged you, and gave you this。
blindness. That's one of their first thoughts. Predestinarian view. Now,。
the second one is the prenatal view. Anybody... Any guesses on what it could。
mean? Prenatal view. Now, it actually could mean that the man actually sinned in the。
womb. Anybody remember their sins in their womb? You remember? Somebody nodded. I。
don't know if he was nodding off or... He actually remembered. This was the other,。
second view. Prenatal view. That you actually can sin within the womb. And。
because of that, God judges you. And particularly, this man was made blind.。
Born blind. The last view is this, the past life view. So, it's basically pre...。
Pre, past, and present, right? So this is the past life view. What do you think it。
means, past life view? Any ideas? Any guesses? No guesses. Actually, back then,。
some rabbis believed in a form of reincarnation. Some commentary says this,。
that sins in this life attributed to the sins committed in the past. So, some small。
sect of rabbis believed that there was some sort of reincarnation. That in your。
past, you committed something wrong, and because of that, you are now。
paying the price in this new life. So,。
any votes? Who thinks any of these views are the... is the right view? Or the one you。
agree with most? Let's just take a vote, just for fun, just to get everybody up.。
Predestinarian view. Who thinks this was the most... this view makes the most sense。
for them? Predestinarian view. That this man is judged for the sins that he。
would make in the future. Anybody? Yeah? Kelly? Okay. Kelly, why did you...。
Come on! I just want to have some fun, right? It's our last night. Last Saturday。
night. Or JP, come on. Give us any ideas. Just say something. God is omniscient.。
Okay, God is omniscient. Okay, very good. Okay, second view. Prenatal view. That you。
could actually sin in the... let's ask the person who actually nodded off.。
Alright, why did you think or nod? I think because the pain that caused you to sin,。
right? And sometimes when you're in pain, you kind of lose that logic or。
control in order to make you sin more. You felt pain in the womb? Is that your。
thing? Interesting. Okay, he felt pain in the womb. I'm not gonna argue against it.。
Past life view. I guess everybody's a past life view. You all believe in。
reincarnation? Okay, you don't have to raise your hand. It's okay. Alright, so。
there's three different views, but what does Jesus say in response to the。
disciples asking this question? Let's read it together. Verse 2 here. 1, 2, 3.。
Or verse 3, sorry. 1, 2, 3. "Neither this man nor his parents sinned," Jesus said. "But。
this happened that the works of God might be displayed in him. As long as it。
is day, we must do the works of the one who sent me. Night is coming when no one。
can work." Wow. Okay, so what is Jesus' view? So Jesus' view is that this man didn't sin.。
The parents didn't sin either. So who is to blame? Is Jesus blaming God? Is。
that the view here? Jesus is saying, "No, this happened. There's no one。
to blame." Blame is not the right word. Would you agree? Blame is not the right。
word. Blame is suggesting that someone did something wrong.。
Blame is not the right word. Instead, Jesus is saying someone took。
responsibility. Is that right? No, that's not right also because it means。
somebody also did something wrong, right? So blame isn't the right。
word. Responsibility isn't the right word. What is the right word? Uncle Vincent,。
what do you think is the right word? I'm really getting your involvement. Come on,。
let's get it together, guys. Blame isn't the right word. Taking。
responsibility isn't the right word. God had a plan, the best plan. That's the。
right word. You're welcome, Uncle Vincent. I got you. And what is the biblical。
view? What is the Old Testament view? What is the New Testament view? The Old。
Testament view is that we live in a broken world because of Adam and Eve, and。
because of that, this world is due to sin. And so we're not in our perfect bodies.。
We're in our corrupted, sinful bodies because of the first sin, original sin,。
right? But God has a plan. God has a plan. He uses the broken things of this world,。
the sinful, the weak things of this world, to reveal his nature, to reveal his grace。
and his love. He uses our brokenness and makes it a blessing. Amen? Amen.。
So that is the view. So what happens after this? Jesus heals this man. He goes...。
Jesus loves using mud for the eyes. Did you guys try it in Israel? Put some mud。
in your eyes. Maybe you saw further. Didn't need laser surgery. Maybe you had。
correctional. I'll try it when I go to Israel. Maybe I'll put it on my eyes.。
Maybe I can see further. From 20/20 to 30/30 maybe? Yeah? See further. I'm just。
playing with you guys. It's a fun night. Come on. Okay, let's read together verse。
13 to 17. All right? Let's see what happens afterwards. So somehow this。
man miraculously gets healed. Let's read together what happens afterwards. One, two,。
three.。
All right. So a miracle happened. A man that was born blind, now they confirm。
sort of, "Yeah, it must be this man. He's been healed." And what is the religious。
leaders, what is their response? Are they like, "Wow, praise the Lord.。
Hallelujah. Let's sing a thousand hallelujahs." Right? Is that the response?。
No. So it's very interesting. There's four perspectives here. Firstly, the disciples,。
their perspective is they saw the blind man. And what was their response? They're。
like, "This man should be used for our intellectual debate. Who is to blame?" They。
didn't see the need of this blind man. They didn't care for him, feed him, help。
him, ask Jesus to heal him. No. They just wanted to go into an intellectual debate.。
The religious leaders, what is the response?。
What do religious leaders care for? Their。
religion, keeping their standards, setting the bar high. They wanted to protect the。
law and the Sabbath. Why were the Pharisees so unhappy? Why were they so。
unhappy? Because are you allowed to make mud on Sabbath? You're not allowed to。
make mud on the Sabbath. It was the Sabbath. When did Jesus heal this guy?。
What does it say? It was on Sabbath. It's a sacred day. You're supposed to rest.。
You're not allowed to make mud. And so the Pharisees ignored Christ's power to。
heal because they saw that the keeping of Christ's law and Sabbath。
were more important than his healing. They felt that Christ was intruding。
their theological rules and perspectives. Verse 14, right? Let's read verse 14 again.。
"Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was on the。
Sabbath." You're not allowed to make mud and you're not certainly not allowed to。
heal on the Sabbath. God is resting, right? He has the other six days to do。
miracles. Jesus, you can't be healing. Come on. And so the Pharisees are so upset。
that the Sabbath has been broken, this man has been healed, that what do they。
call in? Who do they call in? The man's parents, right? So let's read this。
together. Verse 16 to 24. Okay, let's read that. Can you read this for me?。
One, two, three.。
[inaudible]。
They still did not believe.。
[inaudible]。
So the Pharisees asked the parents to come in to have confirmation because in。
Jewish law, customs, you need at least two or three people as witnesses. So the。
parents come in. Is this your son? Has he been born? Was he born blind? Has he been。
healed? If you were the parents and your son had just been healed and can see, how。
would you react? How would you react, guys? Give thanks. You would sing give。
thanks, right? You would be ecstatic. You would be so happy. You'd be in tears。
telling everybody. But what is the parents' reaction here? How would you。
describe it? How would you describe the parents'。
reaction here? Parents, how would you describe it?。
Ni hao. Michelle? Huh? Mild. Are they eating something mild? Some noodles,。
mild noodles? Yeah, mild. They're fearful, right? He is our son, but now he can。
see now and who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age. He will speak。
for himself. They're afraid. What are they afraid of? They're afraid of the。
religious leaders. What else are they afraid of? They're afraid they're gonna。
get kicked out of this community, the synagogue, because having community was a。
very important identity back then, right? Like having your football club。
membership, country club membership. What membership do you guys have? Right? So。
important. KFCI membership, right? Right? They didn't want to lose their。
membership. They worked their whole life for this. They memorized the Old。
Testament when they were young. They did the--what's the celebration when。
they became teens? What's it called again? Bar Mitzvah, right? They're a part of。
this whole community. They've been working their whole life for it, and now。
it's being threatened. It's being threatened. The parents were threatened。
that they would--frightened that they would be excommunicated, rejected because。
their son was also gonna be rejected. There was a social pressure from the。
religious leaders, and it was so great. They couldn't celebrate their own。
child being healed. Your own child could see again. They couldn't celebrate.。
That's crazy. That is crazy. And so, just to recap, the disciples, they saw the blind。
man, and what did they see? They saw an intellectual debate. They were like,。
"Who's to blame? Let's have a fun debate here." They didn't see the man's needs. The。
Pharisees, they saw the blind man being healed, and what did they see? They saw。
rules being broken. Who broke the rule? It's the Sabbath. No healing. No mud making.。
Don't make mud on Sundays, guys, or Saturdays for Jews. Don't make mud.。
The parents, they saw their son, and instead of seeing a miracle, instead of。
seeing Jesus work the miracle, they saw fear. Fear. Incredible.。
But there's one last perspective, and that perspective is obviously Jesus.。
Jesus saw the blind man. What value does the blind man have in that society?。
Not much value, but Jesus saw value in him. Jesus saw his weakness, and he turned。
it into a blessing, that the work of God might be seen in and through him.。
So,。
it says this in verse 35. Let's read this together, verse 35. So, they threw him out,。
right? One, two, three. Jesus heard. Why did they kick him out? Do you know why。
they kicked him out? Cuz。
earlier, just before this, sorry I don't have it, but the blind man was saying, "No。
mere man can heal." Right? "No mere man can heal." Is this it? No, no. "No mere man。
can heal." And the blind man was like, "But this man healed me, so he must be from God.。
He must be a prophet." And the religious leaders, they were so fed up that they。
threw him out. They threw him out. No mere man can heal. Jesus was able to heal.。
Jesus is no mere man. He must be from God. And what does Jesus do at the end here?。
"Do you believe in the Son of Man?" That's one of his names in the Old Testament.。
"The Son of Man will come down on clouds of fire." On clouds, sorry. He reveals his。
identity. Who is he? And Jesus says, "The one speaking to you." He reveals himself.。
This is one of the very few times Jesus reveals himself to the Samaritan woman,。
the Messiah. "I am he." And he says it to the blind man here. "I am that person, the。
one speaking to you." And what is the man's reaction? He says, "Lord, I believe." And。
what did he do? He worshipped, praised, gave Jesus all the glory. The glory that。
he belongs, that only he, that belongs to him. Thank you. Still a little sick. That。
is okay. Because Jesus makes us strong in our weakness. And so Jesus saw this blind。
man in the temple on the floor begging. Nobody looked at him. Nobody cared. Nobody。
valued him. Nobody gave him a job. He had no value. But Jesus saw him.。
Touched his eyes, put mud in his eyes, and healed him. The disciples didn't see him。
as somebody that needed to be loved, that was precious, that was valued.。
Just intellectual debate. The Pharisees saw him as a religious, somebody broke。
the religious laws and kicked him out. And the parents were so fearful that they。
didn't see a miracle through Jesus. And so today, as we enter into our new season,。
as we enter into our new season, I just want us to give thanks for the last。
seven years. The last seven years. I think our pastoral team has done the best job。
to do things the Jesus way. I mean, Pastor John loves us with the Father's heart.。
Hi, Pastor John. And he's shown us in this last seven years, right, six, seven years,。
the servant's heart, the Father's heart. And, you know, Pastor James, Pastor。
Michelle, Pastor Josh, when he was here, really tried to build up those clans,。
the disciples, to become more like...build us up in these clans so that we become。
more like Jesus. And as the outreach and missions pastor, we've gone to Cambodia。
twice, we've gone to Philippines twice, we've gone to Taiwan twice, we just came。
back. We tried to reach out with the love of Jesus, to value the people in the。
different countries, just like Jesus. We've seen people raised up to become。
leaders, our worship leaders,。
to lead like Jesus, to exemplify Jesus in their worship leading. We've seen our G5,。
the next generation of leaders, come and preach and preach on Jesus. Gabe, Paul,。
Julian, Bonnie, others, Anthony, if he's still G5. We've seen these guys grow up。
and preach and be built up just like Jesus, preaching like Jesus, speaking of。
Jesus. And we've seen all of you, we've seen people come to know。
Jesus in our congregation.。
Charlotte came to know Jesus. Kathy knew Jesus through here. Mark, the kid who came。
to Taiwan with us, right? They came to know Jesus--not this Mark, he's still on his。
phone. Some things never change in the last seven years. We've seen people come。
to know Jesus, go on their first mission trip, share the gospel. Charlotte went to。
Uganda, Kathy's been on, I don't know, three or four mission trips. Mark went to。
Taiwan for the first time, shared the gospel, led people to know Jesus through。
the mission trips. We've seen our worship leaders grow up。
before our eyes, right? So that I don't need to do it anymore. You remember when。
I used to lead? I was still skinny back then and had long hair, right? And so I。
think that in our last seven, six, seven years, we've done everything that we。
could as our pastoral team to lead us in the Jesus way, amen? And I believe as。
Pastor James takes over and we move to Sunday, we'll continue going towards the。
Jesus way. And I so look forward to that. I look forward to my sabbatical first. I。
look forward to putting mud on my eyes in Israel. Maybe I'll be able to see。
further and clearer. And as Pastor James says, we don't exactly know the。
way, but we know the way maker. And that's why I've chosen this song for us, just to。
give thanks and to look forward at the same time. And so let's all stand. I。
believe Jesus is in our midst. Let's worship as Jesus does. Let's worship him。
as the blind man did, giving thanks, giving praise for the only one that is。
worthy. Let us respond and close that Jesus is the way maker. Heavenly Father,。
we give you thanks. Let's all raise our hands. We give you all the glory. You are。
our healer. You make the blind see the death here. You know our weaknesses and。
you heal our weaknesses in your time, in your way. You've led us as our shepherd。
in this last seven years with Pastor John as our Moses. And we thank you for。
Pastor James as he'll lead us as our Joshua through the next series period of。
time. We believe Lord you've led us through this way and that you're。
continuing to guide us. You are the perfect, the only, the healing, guiding, the。
miracle worker, the way maker. Hallelujah. Amen.。
