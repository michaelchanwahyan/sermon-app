I want to ask, did anyone just come back from a trip?。
Did anyone plan to go on a trip?。
If you don't have money, I can't help you.。
If you don't have money, I can't help you.。
Don't ask the pastor for money.。
If you don't have money, you can't travel.。
I know Christmas is a holiday.。
I know for some of us,。
especially my group of junior boys,。
I know some of you are going to take exams after Christmas.。
Is there anyone who is going to take exams in January?。
How do you feel? I want to ask you, friends who are going to take exams in January.。
Christmas.。
It's so quiet.。
It's like you're not at the front of the school to study.。
For me, I'm happy during Christmas.。
Because I take exams and then take a holiday.。
But when it comes to middle school, I take exams after Christmas.。
Can you imagine what I do during Christmas?。
I study and study.。
So, for some people, holiday is a happy time.。
For others, holiday is not a happy time.。
It's like they're having a hard time.。
But after Christmas, there's a name.。
I'm not afraid of reading the wrong word.。
So I won't embarrass myself by reading the wrong word.。
After Christmas, there's a calendar.。
We've mentioned this before.。
It's like a calendar.。
If you've been to a church,。
we have candles in the church.。
But not for people who are getting married.。
Some of you may have seen it.。
What is a candle?。
It's a calendar.。
We wait for Jesus to come back。
and we pray for him to be resurrected.。
So, in the calendar of the church,。
the calendar of the church,。
what is it after Christmas?。
There's a day of manifestation.。
I don't know if you know this.。
If you've been to Eastern Europe,。
I haven't been there.。
I'd like to go there.。
If you've been to Eastern Europe,。
the Eastern Orthodox Church,。
their Christmas is not on this day.。
Sorry, it's not on December 25th.。
Does anyone know when it is?。
January 7th.。
Yes, January 7th.。
Or January 6th.。
This is the day of the main manifestation,。
the day of Jesus' manifestation.。
Of course, we use December 25th.。
But I think the common meaning is that Jesus is manifesting.。
But what happens after Jesus manifests?。
Jesus is crucified on the cross.。
I think you've heard this story before.。
Some of you have heard this story before.。
It's not that the story is bad,。
but you're familiar with it.。
But today, I'd like to share。
some unremarkable Christmas clips.。
Maybe you've been to church for many years,。
and you've found some scriptures you've never seen.。
Or you've never noticed the meaning of the scriptures.。
But when it comes to manifestation,。
Jesus' manifestation is like a baby.。
I think it's normal.。
I don't know if you've ever thought about。
a story about the myth.。
Does anyone like to research about myth?。
Yes, there is.。
There's one.。
Maurice has.。
Why is everyone so quiet?。
I don't know if you've noticed,。
even in Japanese animation,。
there are many myth elements in the animation.。
I don't know if you know.。
In Japan, there is a religion called "Shinto".。
I'm not talking about the actual religion.。
But there are many myths in China。
about how the gods appear.。
Does anyone know how the gods appear?。
Why is everyone so quiet?。
I thought you were watching...。
Okay, let me give you an example.。
Maybe you're not warmed up.。
Your brain is a bit cold.。
Maybe you're not warmed up.。
Okay, who is this?。
Oh, I can say it.。
Why can I say it all of a sudden?。
I want to ask who this priest is.。
Yes, in the Hellion myth,。
I want to ask what his role is.。
No, not his role.。
I mean, what is his function in the myth?。
What is his ability?。
Yes.。
Yes, so what is he?。
What is the god's image?。
What is the god's face?。
What is his superpower?。
What is his superpower?。
I don't know how to use this word.。
Lightning.。
Yes, thank you very much, Maurice.。
Lightning.。
Let me read the wiki.。
This is my answer to the wiki.。
It says,。
Zeus is the king of the Olympus Mountain.。
He is also the king of the universe.。
When he is in a good mood,。
the sun shines brightly on the sky.。
When he is in tears,。
it will rain.。
It sounds like a god's story.。
He can disperse the dark clouds,。
and make the sky appear like a rainbow.。
He can also pile up the dark clouds。
and make strong winds in the air,。
so that the sky will be illuminated by lightning.。
This is my answer to the wiki.。
It sounds like a god's story.。
A thunderbolt can kill people.。
I don't know if anyone uses a computer。
to play the games of Greek mythology.。
But lightning is not only this.。
There is another one that you may be more familiar with.。
Can you guess who I am talking about?。
It's not the "Lightning and the Sky".。
Thank you.。
Thank you for your answer, but it's not the "Lightning and the Sky".。
It's related to thunder.。
It's the "Thunder God".。
I think you may be familiar with this one.。
Does anyone know what is the background of this?。
What is the setting?。
Yes, it's from Greek mythology.。
Wow, that was quick.。
Greek mythology.。
What is the god doing?。
What is the god's name?。
What is the god's name?。
I will read it out loud.。
It's the "Thunder God" again.。
It sounds like me.。
It sounds like me.。
I don't know if you have ever thought about this.。
Maybe we are too familiar with Marvel.。
I guess no one has watched Marvel.。
It was over a few years ago.。
Some people have mentioned someone, but I don't know if you have watched it.。
I don't know if you have watched it or not.。
We watch Hollywood movies,。
or watch TV shows,。
or even cartoons.。
When we talk about the god, we often think about this kind of image.。
Of course, some of them are a bit controversial.。
But we often talk about the god's ability.。
The god we think of。
when we talk about salvation。
is like this.。
But I don't know if you have ever thought about。
how Jesus is written in the Bible.。
How is Jesus written in the Bible?。
Yes, it's in the Bible.。
We will answer that later.。
It's not obvious.。
How is Jesus written in the Bible?。
You should have heard this story when you were a kid.。
How is Jesus written?。
You will find that there is no such thing.。
What's even funnier is that。
in the early church,。
they made a lot of baby Jesus stories to make Jesus look more powerful.。
What does that mean?。
I will just mention one.。
It means that a baby Jesus can jump from a building to the top of a building.。
Of course, this is a fake story.。
It's not in the Bible.。
Don't say that it's a fake story.。
There is no such thing.。
But you will find that Jesus doesn't have this.。
If we use the perspective of making videos,。
making Jesus' story may be a waste of money.。
If we make Jesus' story,。
I mean the story after Jesus' birth,。
if we make Jesus' story,。
it will be a waste of money.。
Because it's not obvious at all.。
Let's start with a passage from the Bible.。
I will not read too much.。
Some of the scriptures you may be familiar with,。
but some of them you may not.。
Let's start with a passage.。
I will invite you to read it.。
I will read it in English this time.。
I will read it in Chinese later.。
English first.。
1, 2, 3。
"The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.。
We have seen His glory, the glory of the One and Only Son,。
who came from the Father, full of grace and truth."。
What does it say in Chinese?。
It says, "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.。
We have seen His glory, the glory of the One and Only Son,。
the glory of the One and Only Son,。
I believe that the word "made flesh"。
is familiar to you if you are a mentor,。
or a little bit of an explorer,。
or someone who has a name.。
You may be familiar with this word.。
"The Word became flesh" is a more ancient Chinese expression.。
If you use English, it is straightforward.。
"The Word became flesh"。
Let's think about Christmas a little bit.。
We usually think of a beautiful picture on Christmas.。
It is beautiful.。
Let's not even consider it an artwork.。
If you have seen the Christmas decorations at church last year,。
or at the mall,。
there are less decorations at the mall,。
but you may see something similar.。
You know, it is like Jesus.。
You may see something like this.。
Isn't it beautiful?。
There are angels.。
The Bible says that the angels are the reason for Christmas.。
This is what we usually think of on Christmas.。
But if we go back to 1 Kings 1,。
it is a short chapter.。
It is in 2 Kings 7.。
I want to ask where Jesus was born.。
The place where Jesus was born is a place where the horses are released.。
The place where Jesus was born is a place called a "horse room".。
I have never been to a horse room.。
I don't have money, so I have never been to a horse room.。
I found a picture of a horse room on the Internet.。
A more beautiful picture of a horse room.。
A horse room looks like this.。
This is more beautiful.。
But I want to ask if anyone has been to an animal park.。
What do animals look like?。
Does anyone think that the animals are very fragrant, beautiful,。
and smell good?。
Or smelly?。
Or do some people think that animals are more fragrant?。
I think people who have seen a red cat may feel more comfortable.。
But if you go to an animal park,。
you should know that animals are smelly.。
They have sounds.。
Animals will scream if there is a sound.。
The animals you saw earlier were very quiet.。
I think the reality is that。
they may be screaming because of the sound of Jesus' cry.。
But if you imagine that animals are very noisy in an animal park.。
So we think about peace.。
But when I was preparing for this message,。
maybe that is not a matter of peace.。
Maybe that is a noisy thing.。
There are animals screaming.。
Let you choose.。
I think you were all born in a hospital.。
If you are not, let me know.。
Let you choose.。
Do you think it is better to be born in a hospital。
or in the middle of animals?。
Of course, today's health perspective is hospital.。
I won't ask you to be born in a horse room.。
This is Jesus.。
You may have heard this story many times.。
But we rarely think about a real horse room.。
What is a real place for animals to be kept?。
If Jesus is really so powerful,。
why did he appear in this way?。
I just said that the gods are very visible.。
You can tell by looking at them.。
This is a monk.。
This is a goddess.。
But you look at the baby and say, "This is Jesus."。
Of course, we know that Jesus has a divine work.。
We believe that Jesus has many divine works.。
Of course, we know that the greatest divine works are death and resurrection.。
But before we talk about this, let's think about the Book of Ecclesiastes.。
We just read it.。
Let's read it in Chinese this time.。
1, 2, 3.。
"He came to the city of Jerusalem, and dwelt among us."。
"Filled with grace and truth, we have seen his glory."。
"He is the one who came from the Father, and is the glory of the Son."。
Jesus didn't come to play with the baby.。
The Bible says that he lives among us.。
What does "live among us" mean?。
Let's go back to the Bible.。
Let me use a Lego example to explain.。
We say, "He came to the city of Jerusalem, and dwelt among us."。
Has anyone played with Lego?。
Have you played with it when you were little?。
You have so few hands.。
You have some hands at home.。
Good thing you have one hand.。
I don't play with it much.。
I just build things.。
I don't play with little people.。
Right.。
I'll pretend you've never played with Lego.。
You should know what Lego is.。
Little people are cute, right?。
Imagine two days later.。
The first day of 2025.。
Imagine when you wake up.。
You've become a Lego.。
What do you think will happen?。
What changes will happen in your life after you become a Lego?。
I think there are benefits.。
You don't have to eat.。
You don't have to sleep.。
You won't be tired.。
But you can't do these actions.。
Can you do these actions?。
I want to ask, "What are these actions for?"。
I can do this.。
But can I do this?。
Can I run?。
I can walk.。
But I can't run.。
I shouldn't run.。
Of course, you can run when you watch Lego animation.。
But you can imagine a Lego.。
If I use Professor Karen's example,。
you become a horse.。
Even worse.。
Lego is still called "It hurts when you step on it."。
"It hurts when you step on it."。
"It's dead when you step on it."。
Thank you, Professor Karen, for giving me an example.。
I can think of this.。
Jesus became a human.。
I don't dare to say the same thing.。
But at least there is something similar.。
He is not forced.。
He voluntarily enters this kind of restricted situation.。
How do I say this?。
I know there are some mentors who have children.。
I have some classmates and friends.。
My age group of friends has children.。
I want to share something with you.。
I know you are younger.。
But I heard from your parents.。
Babies drink milk at night.。
What is "milk at night"?。
It means drinking milk at night.。
Why is it like...。
It's not a deep word.。
It means drinking milk at night.。
So,。
babies are in this state.。
They don't care about your mood.。
They don't care about their parents' mood.。
They just drink milk when they want to.。
They don't care if you are sleeping or not.。
So, the most difficult thing for parents is。
to give babies milk at night.。
I have experienced this.。
I have experienced this in my life.。
Don't say you haven't.。
Don't tell me you haven't tried giving babies milk at night.。
If you have, ask your parents.。
See if you really haven't tried it.。
Babies are like this.。
Babies are a very fragile concept.。
They basically don't know how to speak.。
I said earlier that the Church creates stories.。
So, the stories they create。
are the stories Jesus would speak in his birth.。
You don't believe it, right?。
You don't believe it's a baby like this.。
It's not a magical baby.。
It's not like the magical babies in movies.。
At least, there is no such description in the Bible.。
The description in the Bible is that Jesus was born in this world in a very simple way.。
You might ask, why is that?。
Why don't we use the biblical description we mentioned earlier?。
We would believe it.。
Maybe the reason is that。
when he was born in this form,。
he would let us know。
the true fragility of our hearts,。
our weakness, and our struggles.。
Why do I say this?。
Let's look at a passage.。
Most of the time, you won't notice it after reading it.。
Let me ask you.。
Who are the characters in the Bible?。
Except Jesus.。
Yes, there are a few.。
Yes, there are a few.。
Actually, it's not three, but a few.。
And then?。
Why is it so fast?。
Let's pause.。
This is too fast.。
There are other people.。
I believe that's what he thought.。
So, let's ignore him.。
He's just a character in the Bible.。
But there is a person in the Bible.。
A king.。
I want to ask, what kind of person is King Herod?。
I heard someone say something.。
Yes, a king.。
What is a king?。
A leader.。
Let's use a Chinese example.。
If you are studying Chinese,。
I know some people are forced to study Chinese.。
How do you start studying Chinese?。
In Chinese history, there are kings and feudal lords.。
They are the ones who govern the land.。
King Herod is one of them.。
So, he's not a great person.。
He's a relatively small king.。
He has some abilities,。
but he's not that powerful.。
Historically, people don't like King Herod.。
They don't like him.。
They think he's useless and can't do anything.。
So, there is a technique in the Bible.。
What is it?。
It says that when King Herod was alive,。
Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Judah.。
There were a few philosophers and doctors from the East。
who came to Jerusalem.。
They said, "When Jesus was born and became the King of Judah,。
we saw his star rise,。
so we came to worship him."。
Don't say anything about the words in the Bible.。
I'm warning you. Don't say anything.。
What was King Herod's reaction?。
Was he very happy?。
Was he like, "Wow, that's great!"。
I see that he's very happy, so I'm telling you not to say anything.。
At least you have some concept.。
But no.。
There was actually a person in the Bible.。
Actually, it wasn't this person.。
Later, I'll talk about it.。
It was a group of people.。
It wasn't the news of the star rising.。
They were very happy.。
No.。
King Herod heard this and was very anxious.。
The people of Jerusalem were also very anxious.。
I guess King Herod didn't have an exam.。
He wasn't afraid because he didn't have an exam。
so he was probably afraid.。
King Herod.。
The reason why the Bible says King Herod was afraid。
is because he heard people say,。
"There's a king of the Jews."。
The title of King Herod is "King of the Jews."。
So, you see Jesus.。
The Bible doesn't say that Jesus can speak.。
So Jesus didn't say that he was the king when he was born.。
No.。
Jesus was just born as a baby.。
But people at the time were like,。
"Is there a king?"。
They didn't know it was Jesus.。
If you look at the Bible,。
they didn't know it was Jesus.。
They just knew that there was a star representing a king.。
A baby was born。
and it already made a king.。
I said a king of the Jews.。
He seemed to have some ability.。
But he was already anxious.。
So the reason wasn't because of the exam.。
The reason was definitely not because of the exam.。
The reason was probably because he discovered something.。
He didn't know if there was a person or something.。
That something was impacting his source of confidence.。
So, for the king of the Jews,。
this position was his source of confidence.。
Today, we're not kings.。
Obviously, we're not.。
But I believe some things are also the source of your confidence.。
Maybe you think you're very handsome.。
Or you think, "Please don't say it."。
Or you think, "You're very handsome."。
Sorry, I shouldn't say that.。
Or you think, "You're very handsome."。
Sorry, I'm just talking about boys.。
You don't say it even if you think you are.。
Maybe I'm not good at playing the piano.。
I'm not saying that.。
Maybe I'm not good at playing the piano.。
Maybe I know a lot of Bible.。
My GPA is very high.。
I got a score last time.。
We think about these things.。
Even if I'm not a king of the Jews,。
there are some things I think I value.。
This is me.。
But it's very normal.。
Because this is how our society defines us.。
For example, you see a pastor in church.。
Or you see a student in society.。
I'm a certain job.。
I have a certain status.。
Even my family.。
I'm someone's son or daughter.。
It defines us.。
And when something happens。
that affects us,。
we become...。
We become anxious and uneasy.。
What did King Heliu do back then?。
Have you read this passage?。
What did he do?。
Don't say that.。
What did he do?。
He called all the priests and religious teachers。
to ask them where the cross was.。
I won't talk about the rest.。
You can go back and read it.。
You can go back and read it.。
But what are these people?。
Except for us, the Bible students,。
we've been looking up。
to priests and religious teachers。
who always fight with Jesus.。
But if we use the concept of the time,。
why did he call them?。
Because they were walking AIs.。
I'm not using the concept of the time.。
They were walking AIs.。
Because they were very learned.。
They could tell him,。
"The Bible says this."。
"So it might be here."。
Today's concept...。
I know you might not ask pastors or parents.。
You should get your phone and ask,。
"What do you do?"。
"Do you know anything?"。
You wouldn't call us, right?。
You'd get your phone and Google it.。
Or I don't know if anyone is better。
at asking with an AI.。
AI can do homework.。
You can ask it.。
But will it help us?。
I'm not telling you not to use it.。
I sometimes use it to write letters.。
I do that.。
But...。
for life's problems,。
for anxiety,。
I said anxiety.。
For these emotions,。
for these struggles,。
do you think asking AI will help?。
Yes. Who said yes?。
Okay, I'll talk to you later.。
I'll talk to you later.。
I'll pretend you have some problems.。
For example, I have a joke.。
One time, the toilet rack at my house was lost.。
I didn't know how to fix it.。
I searched for a way to fix it online.。
And I found it.。
I was relieved.。
I was not anxious.。
The toilet rack was fixed.。
But there are some things,。
even if I have knowledge,。
I can't solve.。
Has anyone ever robbed a toilet?。
Here.。
Yes. Thank you, brother.。
Thank you, brother.。
Thank you, brother.。
You raised your hand so honestly.。
Has anyone ever robbed a mask?。
I really had to search for it.。
Has anyone ever robbed a check-in bag?。
Has anyone ever robbed a check-in bag?。
You mean the check-in bag you used to do?。
I forgot.。
Did I spend too much time on it?。
It's okay.。
I remember.。
I think there are some things。
that we can't solve with our knowledge.。
Of course, I'm not saying knowledge is useless.。
If we don't have vaccines,。
if we don't have knowledge,。
our anxiety won't be solved。
if we don't have knowledge.。
I remember a friend of mine。
during the most serious period。
of the pandemic,。
he told me something.。
He said he watched the news every day.。
Guess what he watched.。
How many people died?。
It's true.。
But how many people died。
compared to how many people were infected?。
Why do you think?。
Ah, to see if there are any more.。
And?。
His logic is like this.。
The more people are infected, the more scared they are.。
The fewer people, the less scared they are.。
I don't know if I've thought about it.。
Maybe we're all small.。
But I guess...。
I see you laughing.。
I guess you've thought about it.。
Anxiety is not just...。
Anxiety is whether it's when we were small,。
or when we were adults.。
Even how many years of life experience we have.。
There are some things that I really can't solve.。
So we might think Hillary Clinton is bad.。
We think the legislators are bad.。
But from this perspective,。
they are anxious and anxious,。
and they are scared.。
That's not unreasonable.。
There are things that are beyond my knowledge.。
Is it true that she came like this?。
How would I know?。
So...。
Jesus is using the baby's identity to tell you。
that he's not here to scare you.。
If Jesus came like a ghost,。
then I think it's very reasonable for Hillary to be scared.。
Think about it this way.。
A ghost suddenly appears at the door.。
You don't know what he's up to, right?。
But Jesus didn't come to the world like that.。
I've said this for a long time.。
Jesus came to the world as a baby.。
What does "baby" mean?。
It's a baby who doesn't know how to breastfeed,。
but someone else is breastfeeding him.。
Jesus didn't use violence,。
or a way to scare us to scare him.。
I don't know if you feel like you're being forced back into the church.。
Maybe you think so.。
I don't need you to say it.。
You don't need to raise your hand.。
But think about it.。
Jesus didn't force us to go back to church.。
He didn't force us to follow him.。
He used a very weak sign at the time.。
Even Jesus' death.。
We often say that the cross is a very humiliating sign.。
So Jesus' birth and death。
are all very weak.。
The baby is weak.。
How powerful is the cross?。
But the Bible gives us a reason.。
The Bible says。
Jesus did this because。
he wanted to show us our weaknesses.。
He was tested in all aspects,。
just like us,。
but he was not guilty.。
This is the book of Hebrews.。
This is not the book of Psalms.。
This is the book of Hebrews.。
What does it mean?。
I'll give you an example.。
I didn't get a zero in my exam.。
If you really got a zero, tell me.。
I've always had a bad exam.。
Do you have any friends like this?。
How many points do you get?。
"Try harder next time. I'll get this."。
Do you have any friends like this?。
Or are you like this?。
If you are, raise your hand.。
If you are, raise your hand.。
I guess you want to hit him.。
At least someone like this.。
But if someone is worse than you,。
maybe he really didn't get a zero,。
but you got a zero, and he said,。
and he really said,。
"So I'm the same as you?"。
"So you're that bad?。
Let's try harder next time."。
Maybe you're a bit stubborn.。
At least you don't want to hit him.。
You don't want to hit him like you did just now.。
At least it's not like that.。
So Jesus chose to live his life。
as a baby, a normal person.。
He didn't have no achievements. He did.。
Because he had to have achievements。
for us to know he was really that God.。
But in the Bible,。
he came to us like this。
hoping that we could be merciful,。
humble, and humble,。
and receive timely help.。
Jesus taught us to love our enemies.。
I know this is hard.。
I also think it's hard to master this.。
But Jesus was wronged and nailed to the cross.。
Unless you think Jesus should be nailed to the cross.。
Otherwise, he was wronged and hurt.。
But he said, "Love your enemies."。
Jesus said,。
"Those who bear heavy burdens。
will come to us,。
and I will give you rest."。
But you know Jesus sleeps, right?。
I want to ask, what did Jesus do when the storm came?。
He slept.。
Of course, I don't know if he was tired,。
but at least he slept.。
He slept.。
But only a person who sleeps。
can tell you, "Those who bear heavy burdens。
will come to me, and I will give you rest."。
I think this is more convincing.。
It's not like, "I don't need to sleep for hours."。
You wouldn't believe it if he told you that.。
The Bible records Jesus' time as a teenager.。
It doesn't say much,。
but if you look at the Old Testament,。
it's about his teenage years.。
Jesus had to eat,。
and rest,。
and was scolded.。
He had many failures.。
But he had to go through this.。
Because he wanted us to know,。
he understood us.。
He knew what compassion we needed,。
what grace we needed,。
what help we needed.。
Notice, it's "temporary help",。
not "instant help".。
I know the Old Testament is about "instant help",。
but I think "instant help" is more accurate.。
Because it's not, "Whenever I want, I'll help."。
He's not talking about "instant help".。
It's not, "I'll get 0 points in the exam,。
will I get 100 next time?"。
It's not "instant help".。
Jesus is giving us "instant help".。
In our time of need.。
If I can't relax my hands,。
if I'm holding on,。
I can't get this help.。
Like I said, the more we want to hold on,。
the more we can't solve our inner fear.。
I can only relax my hands,。
and I can understand what "instant help" is.。
Christmas.。
I know that holidays are fun,。
except for when you have to read.。
But I hope that Christmas,。
especially this year, is the last time we worship.。
I don't know how many Christmas you've spent.。
I don't know how you think of Christmas,。
or how you think of Jesus.。
But I hope that we have the opportunity to think about。
the story of Christmas,。
if I may use this word.。
He's not talking about a god like Zeus,。
playing with us.。
He's not playing with us like we're a game.。
If you look at the story,。
there are a lot of gods like this.。
I think the only one we believe in is Jesus.。
He's not a god like this.。
He's a god who turned into a goldfish,。
and can be eaten by anyone.。
If I may say so.。
He's willing to。
share everything that we've experienced in life.。
Today's response is a bit special.。
I'd like to invite the audience to sing a response poem.。
But while you're singing,。
I'd like to ask you to lower your heads.。
Please close your eyes.。
I'd like to invite the audience to sing the first part of the poem.。
[MUSIC]。
It was my cross you bore,。
so I could live in the freedom you died for.。
And now my life is yours,。
and I will sing of your goodness forevermore.。
Worthy is your name, Jesus.。
You deserve the praise.。
Worthy is your name.。
Worthy is your name, Jesus.。
You deserve the praise.。
Worthy is your name.。
And now my shame is gone.。
I stand amazed in your love undeniable.。
Your grace goes on and on,。
and I will sing of your goodness forevermore.。
Worthy is your name, Jesus.。
You deserve the praise.。
Worthy is your name.。
Worthy is your name, Jesus.。
You deserve the praise.。
Worthy is your name.。
