Hello, everyone. I am Mr. Lui.。
Welcome to my lecture today.。
Today's topic is "Science and Creativity".。
I believe you all have the impression that。
science and religion seem to have a lot of conflicts.。
I believe that many times it is because we don't understand both sides,。
and that's why we have these misunderstandings.。
I will try to share my understanding with you today.。
The content of my lecture today is partly based on。
Professor Kuo-king's time-lapse,。
and the books and videos of Professor Brian Cox of Manchester University.。
I will also use the Bible to explain some of the topics related to creation today.。
I would like to emphasize that the Bible is not a book of explanation,。
but its description of creation is in line with what we see now.。
I will explain in detail later.。
In China, in the Western Zhou Dynasty,。
there was a saying that "the sky is round and the earth is flat".。
At that time, people thought that the earth was square and flat,。
while the sky was round.。
So the sun and moon rotated in this way.。
This kind of understanding affects other Chinese cultures.。
For example, the copper coin in the middle is square and the outside is round.。
This is the concept of "the sky is round and the earth is flat".。
The sky is round and the earth is flat.。
The earth is flat and the earth is flat.。
The earth is flat and the earth is flat.。
This is the understanding of the universe of China 1000 years ago.。
In the 4th century BC,。
Aristotle predicted that the earth should be round, not square.。
In China, about 100 years after the founding of the Chinese Communist Party,。
the "Cyclical Theory of Heaven" proposed by Zhang Heng。
believed that the sky was like a shell,。
and the earth was like a net,。
but the earth was flat and floating in the water.。
So the shell is rotating outside.。
But in the Old Testament, 700 years before the founding of the Chinese Communist Party,。
Aristotle had already said that the earth is round.。
He said that the gods are sitting on the big circle of the earth.。
The residents on the earth are like caterpillars.。
The gods are like a net, and the net is like a net.。
The sky is flat and the earth is flat.。
The net is like a net, and the earth is flat.。
The earth is like a net, and the net is like a net.。
So in the Old Testament,。
it was already said that the earth is round.。
God pushed the universe out like a growing wormhole.。
The earth we live on now is the solar system,。
and the solar system is a part of the entire galaxy.。
How big is the entire galaxy?。
There are 100,000 light years from one side to the other.。
I want to explain that light years are not a unit of time.。
Light years are units of distance.。
A light year is the speed of light traveling a distance of one year.。
How fast does the light travel?。
Every second can revolve around the earth and turn 7.5 times.。
This is the speed of light.。
So the universe is very big, so we have to use light years.。
But light years are not big enough.。
Sometimes we use light years.。
Light years is the distance of light traveling 100 million years.。
The distance of the galaxy is one thousandth of a light year.。
The earth is one of the points.。
You can't see it here.。
But the arrangement of the universe。
was described in the book of 1,500 BC。
as "God created the earth, and the origin is in the void."。
There is nothing to be said.。
So the part of creation in the Bible。
is not a book to explain physics,。
but its description is accurate.。
How big is the universe?。
The universe is 930-940 light years.。
A light year is the distance.。
I just said that the galaxy is only one thousandth of a light year.。
So the universe is very big.。
How do we know that the universe is expanding?。
This is a phenomenon called "red light."。
Everyone can feel it.。
Imagine a ambulance coming towards you.。
You hear a very oppressive sound.。
When the ambulance leaves you,。
the sound starts to relax.。
When the sound is getting farther and farther,。
the sound is getting longer.。
So in science,。
the sound is moving towards the red side.。
So we can see the light that is moving。
and the light that is not moving.。
The universe can affect many people's thoughts.。
For example, in the 500 BC,。
Heraclitus, a philosopher,。
turned the universe into a sealed space that would not move.。
Heraclitus at that time was the same.。
When the universe is not big or small,。
and it is forever like not moving,。
people will generate some reincarnation thoughts.。
All things are reincarnated and have a cycle effect.。
But if the universe is expanding,。
it means that there is a possibility that it has a beginning.。
So it is not a unchanging universe.。
In Professor Fok-Kun's time-scale,。
there are many charts that help us understand the universe,。
time and space.。
One of them is a knife-shaped ice cream can.。
What does he want to say?。
He wants to say that if we imagine this board is a water,。
there is no water wave at the beginning.。
If there is a stone in the middle,。
the water waves will spread outwards.。
If the speed of this spreading outwards is the speed of light,。
the speed of light is the fastest speed in the universe as we know.。
It can't be faster than the speed of light.。
Then in one second, the speed of light will spread outwards.。
Two seconds is even faster.。
Three seconds is even faster.。
So this is the direction of time.。
And this is the space that the speed of light can go.。
So if the speed of light is the fastest,。
the edge of the ice cream can is the limit.。
Nothing can go faster than the edge of the ice cream can.。
And all substances cannot spread as fast as light.。
So the substance can only exist in the space inside.。
This is what it means.。
When the universe is exploding,。
the force that spreads outward and the force that absorbs inward。
must have a relative balance.。
Because if the expansion is too strong,。
the space in the universe is too large,。
it is difficult for the substance to absorb together and form a star.。
We call this the open universe.。
The open universe is difficult to make life or stars exist.。
But if the force of absorption is greater than the force of expansion,。
the universe will quickly stick together and shrink back to a point.。
So it becomes a closed universe.。
So scientists have calculated that。
to make the universe continue,。
the data that spreads outward must have a small error.。
How small is this error?。
According to the calculation of Professor Paul Davis,。
a colleague of Professor Fok-Kam at Cambridge University,。
this error cannot be greater than 1/10^60.。
What does this mean?。
It means 0.591011 is so small.。
It is so small that it may not make much sense to us.。
In fact, what helps us understand is that。
the universe I just mentioned is 940 billion light-years large.。
The difference between the universe from one side to the other。
cannot be greater than the area of ​​a fingernail.。
This is the accuracy.。
If this accuracy is not reached,。
the universe will not continue.。
So Paul Davis said that。
many scientists believe that。
the universe is fine-tuned for life.。
It can be fine-tuned to allow life to exist.。
Although Paul Davis is not a Christian,。
many scientists have seen a lot of accurate data in the universe.。
When the accuracy is not good,。
they believe that the universe is fine-tuned.。
Many books now use this "reverse speaker" to describe the expansion of the universe.。
What does this speaker mean?。
The lower part is the explosion point.。
When it starts to explode, it is like blowing a balloon.。
When it is blown, the balloon suddenly expands very quickly.。
In English, it is called "inflation".。
Then the speed of the explosion will slow down.。
When it slows down to a certain extent,。
we will find that the explosion is accelerating again.。
So it is like a speaker.。
The flat surface represents the size of the universe.。
Scientists did not know that the universe was expanding.。
The first time scientists proposed this calculation was in 1922.。
It was only in 1929 that it was proven.。
It's been about 100 years for our history.。
So don't think that science is very advanced.。
In fact, we are still very primitive.。
As I said,。
the early 700s BC already knew that the universe was expanding.。
The God "shut out the heavens"。
and the God "spread them out"。
So to understand the explosion,。
we need to understand it with some more specific concepts.。
First, I will talk about the relationship between solid and liquid,。
the matter and the particles.。
Suppose we have an ice cube.。
If we heat the ice cube,。
the ice will break into water.。
When we heat it again,。
the water particles will jump out and become air.。
When we heat it again,。
the water particles will break into acid.。
The particles will jump out of the atoms and atoms.。
Generally speaking,。
we call anything that can flow as a fluid.。
For example, liquid, gas, particles can flow.。
These three are called fluids.。
What if we heat the particles again?。
We break down the structure of the particles,。
such as electrons, neutrons, and neutrons.。
It becomes acid, 10 atomic particles.。
What happens when we heat it again?。
It becomes energy, not matter.。
But the explosion is the other way around.。
At first, all energy is at one point,。
the temperature is extremely high.。
When the explosion occurs,。
the space expands and expands.。
The temperature drops,。
and the particles start to form from energy.。
Gradually, they become different kinds.。
When the temperature drops,。
we can have gas, liquid, solid, etc.。
So the big explosion starts from here.。
The simplest material in the universe is called gas.。
The sun is mainly gas.。
Most of the universe is gas.。
Gas is the simplest.。
The basic structure of a gas is that。
there is a core in the middle.。
There are some positive and negative atoms in the core.。
The neutral atoms are neither positive nor negative.。
The negative atoms are in the electron.。
They are rotating in the outer orbit.。
The simplest structure of the universe is a negative atom.。
The core in the middle has only one positive pole.。
There is an electron in the orbit.。
The negative pole becomes a neutral negative atom.。
The negative atom does not glow.。
But when the electron absorbs energy in the orbit,。
and jumps up to a higher orbit,。
and falls down,。
it will emit blue light from the fifth orbit to the second orbit.。
The fourth orbit to the second orbit will emit green light.。
The third orbit to the second orbit will emit red light.。
These three colors are called tri-color.。
These are the most basic colors.。
The sun emits tri-color.。
The LED emits these three colors.。
What is the importance of the tri-color?。
It is easy to remember.。
The logo of a TV is a tri-color.。
The tri-color can be combined into five colors.。
The sun emits these three colors,。
and emits white light.。
The amazing thing is that the eyes of the gods。
receive these three colors.。
So we see the colors because。
the eyes of the gods have these sensors。
that reflect these three colors.。
There is a chart in the "Fork of Gold"。
that shows the different stages of the universe after the explosion.。
The first stage is a very short time,。
called "Law of Physics Unknown".。
We don't know what physics is.。
I want you to pay attention to the upper part,。
which is about temperature.。
The temperature is getting lower and lower.。
The lower part is the time.。
The first part is the shortest part.。
Physics is unknown.。
It starts from zero to 0.42.0+1 seconds.。
In such a short time,。
physics is unknown.。
So all the explosion theories。
don't count this part at the beginning.。
So they tell you directly that。
there is no need for gods.。
Because the explosion is not included in the model.。
They start from here.。
As the explosion progresses,。
the temperature on the top is getting lower and lower.。
Because the space is getting bigger and bigger.。
Time increases.。
But the temperature is still 100 billion degrees in 1 second.。
If we feel 35 degrees is very hot,。
51 degrees is very hot.。
Here it is 100 billion degrees in 1 second.。
After the explosion,。
it will be 10 billion degrees in 3 minutes.。
So when the temperature is getting lower,。
this graph shows that。
from the atom to the atom,。
then some substances appear.。
The stars appear.。
The star system is formed in about 10 billion years.。
Finally, the sun appears.。
I just explained that。
the theory of quantum mechanics does not need gods.。
Because it does not start from zero.。
The first part of physics cannot be explained.。
So who started it?。
Science cannot explain.。
Science cannot explain whether there are gods.。
Now, in the theory of the explosion in 2022,。
I can explain with this graph.。
I want to emphasize that it is 2022.。
Why?。
Because in the past two years,。
there have been many new discoveries.。
The model is not accurate.。
I will explain later.。
But the basic explanation is。
when the explosion started,。
it was very hot at first.。
After the explosion, the space increased,。
and some substances began to form.。
The light had appeared at that time.。
But the light could not come out.。
Because at that time,。
the light and the electrons of other electrons。
had interaction.。
At this time, it was like a very thick soup.。
The light could not come out.。
It was like a very large fog.。
When the car lights were shot out,。
the fog covered the light.。
So at this time,。
although the light had appeared,。
there was light at first,。
but the light could not come out.。
Around 380,000 years ago,。
the light suddenly appeared.。
Why?。
Because the temperature had dropped.。
The light particles and electrons。
formed the simplest light atoms.。
So suddenly the light appeared.。
Now we see the farthest light in the universe。
is coming out at this time.。
After the light appeared,。
many light atoms began to form.。
The light atoms, like fog,。
covered the light.。
So we have a period of dark ages.。
According to the old model,。
after 300 million years,。
the stars appeared in 400 million years.。
Because at this time,。
the stars began to accumulate together.。
The stars have a nuclear fusion process,。
producing some ultraviolet light.。
Ultraviolet light can make。
the electrons in the nuclear fusion atoms。
jump and start to emit light.。
Many stars have become a spiral structure.。
It is called a star system.。
It is estimated that it appeared after 100 million years.。
The earth appeared after the explosion of 90 billion years.。
The universe is now 137 years old.。
So the earth is about 47 years old.。
This is 2022.。
I will use a simple chart to explain.。
At first, it is estimated that。
there were stars in 400 million years.。
This is the period of dark ages.。
Although the light exists, it cannot come out.。
There were stars in 100 million years.。
I want everyone to remember these two numbers.。
There were stars in 400 million years and stars in 100 million years.。
Two years ago, the Space Agency sent。
a new James Webb space telescope to the moon.。
It broke all our understanding of the beginning of the universe.。
On April 7, 2023,。
it was discovered that the earliest star system。
was found in 300 million years.。
We thought that the star system existed in 100 million years.。
Now, it has been found in 300 million to 500 million years.。
So it broke the model of our ancient science.。
In March of this year, it was found that。
some stars have died in 700 million years.。
What does it mean by dead?。
It means that the whole star system cannot produce new stars.。
But remember that in 700 million years,。
the universe was still very early.。
Now we are talking about 137 billion years.。
So 700 million years is still very early.。
But some stars have died.。
So they cannot produce new stars.。
Earlier this year, a British scientist。
discovered a very strange phenomenon.。
As I said, the universe is 940 billion light years large.。
Our galaxy is only one thousandth of a billion light years.。
This British scientist noticed that。
there are two huge structures in the universe.。
These structures are made up of large stars.。
One of them is called the Big Circle.。
Its diameter is 130 billion light years.。
Each point is a huge star.。
The other is a larger arc.。
Its diameter is 130 billion light years.。
This creator is still making some strange structures.。
It looks like a smiley face.。
Very huge structure.。
So it is very difficult for us scientists。
to understand how these structures are formed.。
As I mentioned, everyone noticed that。
the model of science is not absolutely true.。
Science is just a tool of knowledge。
for understanding the nature and physical world.。
Science is not absolutely true.。
Science must be constantly corrected.。
Science is an approximation to the truth。
in a physical world.。
It cannot be true outside the physical world.。
For example, science cannot be based on。
a poem or a poem.。
A painting is not beautiful.。
Parents' love for children is not science.。
It is not a physical field.。
Science has a very big limit.。
It is not absolutely true.。
So we must understand that。
science has its own function.。
Science is not an absolute authority.。
The Bible is not a book of science.。
The Bible, especially the Book of Genesis,。
is a literary text.。
It does not explain the universe in a physical way.。
It is just a brief description of God's creation.。
The main theme of Genesis is to declare。
that God created the universe.。
God created the universe with his sovereignty.。
At first, God created the universe in a state of vacuum。
and gradually became full of life and various miracles.。
So the first three days are the basic preparation。
for the fourth and fifth days.。
The first day is the day of the sun.。
The second day is the day of the vacuum.。
The vacuum is water and sky.。
The third day is the day of the plants.。
The fourth day is the day of the stars.。
The fourth day is the day of the sun.。
The fifth day is the day of the vacuum.。
The fifth day is the day of the plants.。
The fifth day is the day of the birds.。
The sixth day is the day of the animals.。
This is the structure of the Bible.。
The most important thing is to declare that the universe is God's creation.。
Although it seems to be very light,。
the most important theme in the first four sentences。
is God's creation.。
Although it is a few sentences in Hebrew,。
the theory of the big explosion we just talked about。
is not accurate now.。
But we can understand the basic concept.。
But the time, maybe we scientists。
have to re-change the model。
because of the new discovery in the past two years.。
Although they have to change the model again,。
but we can notice that the basic words。
and the framework of the universe。
we have observed are consistent.。
If we look back at the beginning of God's creation,。
we can see that Professor Fok-Kam's picture。
shows a moment of vacuum.。
Although God created light,。
the light cannot come out.。
There is a dark period.。
After the dark period, the light comes out of the dark.。
So the Bible mentions that light is good,。
and the light and dark are separated.。
Light and dark are later to be separated.。
Of course, we can't say that these sentences。
are the creation of the whole universe.。
Because it is a literary description,。
not a theoretical description.。
But I want to say that。
the Bible says that God created the universe.。
This is the point.。
But in the Bible,。
the creation of the universe is mainly about the earth。
from the second day to the sixth day.。
The first day is about the universe,。
and the second to the sixth day is about the earth.。
It is more detailed.。
And in the Bible,。
there is a detailed description of。
the understanding of the earth。
by modern scientists.。
They believe that the earth was a very hot fluid at first.。
A very hot fluid.。
I just mentioned the fluid,。
including the solid, liquid and gas.。
It was very hot at first.。
At first, they thought that。
the earth we were born on had no atmosphere.。
Even if there was, there was no oxygen.。
Because what did the gas look like?。
It was like the gas that came out of the volcano.。
It was a poisonous gas,。
like sulfur.。
It was not a transparent gas.。
So they estimated that。
the earliest living creatures on this earth。
came from the ocean。
and absorbed sulfur.。
The earliest living creatures。
absorbed these toxins。
and produced oxygen.。
Oxygen is transparent.。
When it absorbs toxins from the atmosphere。
and produces oxygen,。
the atmosphere becomes transparent.。
When there is oxygen, other creatures can slowly form.。
For example, fish, reptiles, abalone, and finally humans.。
This is the current understanding of modern scientists.。
If we pay attention to the Bible,。
it is very strange.。
The four sentences I said on the first day。
are about the formation of the universe.。
From the second day to the sixth day,。
it is about humans.。
Here it talks about the water of the pig.。
There are different types of fluids.。
The water is divided into up and down.。
Some fluids are heavier, some are lighter.。
Some fluids are heavier, some are lighter.。
The use of sulfur is heavy,。
the use of water is light,。
the use of steam is light.。
The fluid is divided into up and down.。
If you have ever been on a plane,。
you will notice that。
when you fly to a few thousand feet,。
the outside temperature may be -60 °C or -70 °C.。
When you fly to a higher level,。
the temperature is low,。
the steam will turn into water and fall to the ground.。
The ground will form a geological shell.。
The geological shell of our planet is very thin.。
It is about 15 to 20 km on average.。
So our planet is like an orange.。
There is a hard skin.。
There are many fluids and fluids in the middle.。
There is a lot of hot sulfur.。
A lot of melted iron is spinning here.。
So the sequence here is that。
there is water at the beginning,。
the water falls to the ground,。
the ground is cooled and formed a geological shell.。
Then the water is collected in the geological shell。
and becomes the sea.。
When there is a sea, there is no rain.。
According to the Bible,。
first there is a green plant,。
a plant of iron seeds,。
a green creature.。
Why green creature?。
Because of the effect of the sun.。
First, it absorbs the smoke from the atmosphere.。
Then it excretes oxygen.。
So with these carbon dioxide,。
the green plant that absorbs the sun's effect and produces oxygen,。
like the seaweeds,。
we have a large atmosphere.。
Then, the third one,。
we see two rivers,。
the first is the Yangtze River,。
where we see the sun and the moon.。
Then, the creatures appear,。
which is water,。
and come out of the water.。
It is the same as what scientists believe now.。
Then there is a bird.。
Then there is a big fish.。
In Chinese, it is also called big fish.。
In English, it is a monstrous creature.。
It is very huge,。
maybe similar to。
dinosaurs.。
Then, at the end,。
there are insects,。
beasts,。
and other creatures.。
Finally,。
according to the image of God,。
we have to follow our own image,。
and finally become human.。
The last one is。
Moses.。
At least 1500 years ago,。
that is,。
3,500 years ago,。
God moved him to write the Bible.。
He did not have。
modern scientific knowledge.。
He did not even know。
the disease,。
the bacteria.。
But God let him write。
this order,。
which is the same as。
what we scientists understand now.。
This is the miracle of the Bible.。
I want to explain one more sentence.。
God said,。
we have to follow our image,。
and finally become human.。
Why is this sentence important?。
Because I believe that。
there are misunderstandings。
in the scientific world.。
Some people say。
that if you count the history of。
the Israelites to the time of Adam,。
it may be around 7,000 years.。
If I find a human。
with a human skeleton。
of 20,000 years,。
how do you explain it?。
The DNA is very close.。
The Bible says that。
the definition of human。
is not from the DNA,。
but from the image of God.。
God may have done something。
similar to humans。
10,000 years ago.。
DNA is a very close creature.。
But those creatures at that time。
did not have God's image,。
no God's spirit,。
and could not communicate with God.。
So God did not。
have a human skeleton.。
So the human in the Bible。
is not defined by DNA,。
but by the image of God.。
Here, we are the three-dimensional。
God, the image of God.。
This is the definition。
of the human in the Bible.。
So if we find a human skeleton。
with a human DNA,。
it is also a human,。
not a human.。
So we can say that。
the human is a human.。
The human is a human.。
Not a human.。
As I said,。
the most amazing thing in the Bible。
is that Moses did not study。
at a modern university.。
He did not have the knowledge。
of modern science.。
But he wrote the book。
"The Book of Genesis"。
more than 3,000 years ago.。
Although it is not a materialistic book,。
it has a lot of precise。
definition of the universe.。
As I said,。
in the 1500 BC,。
God created the earth。
in the sky。
with the power of man.。
The sky is the structure.。
In God's eyes,。
a thousand years are as one day,。
a day is as a thousand years.。
This is the relative theory。
we know now.。
These concepts have existed。
since ancient times.。
As I mentioned,。
God knew that the earth。
was a structure created。
by the expansion of the universe.。
God used his power to create the earth.。
This is a wise world.。
I will explain the wisdom。
later.。
So we notice that。
the universe expansion。
we can observe now,。
the order in which the earth。
and the organisms are formed,。
the order in which the organisms。
are formed,。
the description in the Bible。
is the same.。
These scientific interpretations。
are described in the Bible.。
As I mentioned,。
wisdom,。
we know that DNA。
is not just a material,。
DNA is a program of life.。
There is a programmer,。
there must be a person。
behind the programmer.。
Because the creator is the source of wisdom.。
So we can't say。
there is only material.。
There is no other.。
Because we can see。
there is a creator behind this material.。
There is a creator behind this material.。
Human knowledge of science。
is very short and very active.。
We only know that a battery。
will produce a battery wall。
in 1820.。
God has already predicted。
that in the early days of creation.。
As I mentioned,。
the rocks in the middle of the earth。
are still flowing.。
There are a lot of iron。
in the middle of the earth。
flowing like lava.。
This lava。
is like an electricity。
and produces a battery wall.。
This battery wall is very important。
because when the sun storm。
hits us,。
it is a shield, a protective shield.。
So our earth still has a large atmosphere.。
And the atmosphere of Mars。
is already very thin.。
Because the atmosphere。
of the earth。
has already blown away。
the atmosphere of Mars.。
Because we have this。
protective shield,。
we can survive.。
We see the polar lights,。
the polar lights,。
when the solar panels。
hit us,。
they dissipate。
the energy in the air.。
So we see the light.。
But this is a protective shield.。
Without the protective shield,。
all living things cannot survive.。
So when the sun storm。
hits us,。
it is very kind to us。
to arrange this。
battery wall for us.。
This chart represents。
the earth surrounded by the sun.。
We have four seasons here.。
Last week。
was summer.。
If you think about。
the summer,。
we are facing the sun。
at noon.。
Do you know。
how many times。
the earth rotates itself?。
Many people answer。
one circle.。
One circle is 360 degrees.。
But if we really。
rotate 360 degrees,。
there will be a problem.。
Why?。
If we rotate。
one circle a day,。
the sun will be here。
in the future.。
After half a year,。
when noon comes,。
we will be here。
on the day of winter solstice.。
We will not face the sun.。
The sun will be at night.。
It turns out that。
God is very wonderful.。
God makes the arrangement。
of the earth surrounded by the sun.。
He rotates 0.9856 degrees。
with us every day.。
One circle is 360 degrees.。
It turns out that。
the earth rotates。
360.9856 degrees.。
Why?。
We have 365 days。
or 365 days。
in a year.。
In addition to the second,。
we have half a year。
to winter solstice.。
Every day,。
we have more than。
one day of winter solstice.。
If we add 0.9856 degrees,。
it will be 180 degrees.。
Originally,。
when we were here。
and went to winter solstice,。
God made us。
more than one degree.。
When we are in winter solstice,。
noon is also。
under the sun.。
Isn't it wonderful?。
So you notice。
that when the creator of the world。
is extremely wonderful,。
he even arranged。
the earth to rotate a little more。
for us.。
We see that science。
cannot prove。
that God exists.。
Science is only applied in the natural world。
and the material world.。
God is a spirit.。
So science is not an absolute truth.。
Science is only limited to。
the approximation to the truth。
in the physical world.。
Science is not a authority.。
God made people。
in the absolute world。
through a revelation.。
God made people。
in the non-absolute world。
through a revelation.。
After people were made,。
they produced。
many different knowledge.。
Science is only one of the knowledge。
that can be applied。
in the material world.。
It cannot explain。
art,。
love of parents to children,。
art, poetry, songs, and dance.。
Science cannot do that.。
Science is limited.。
If we look at the future prediction,。
people in the superstition。
will look at the whole.。
But if we look at how science is applied,。
economic prediction,。
weather prediction, and science prediction。
are not accurate.。
So we always blame。
the astronomical observatory for bad predictions.。
We will say they are not doing enough.。
But in fact, they have limitations.。
Although they have all the super computers,。
but because science is limited,。
science is only slowly。
approaching the truth.。
It is not the truth itself.。
If you look at the Bible,。
you will notice that。
the Bible is very different.。
The words of God in the Bible。
whether you like it or not,。
it must happen.。
So the words of God in the Bible。
I will explain later.。
Why does God。
have to be disdainful?。
The Bible has already said,。
"My will is not your will,。
your way is not my way,。
how high is the sky above the earth,。
how high is my way above your way,。
how high is my will above your will."。
This is what God。
announced to us.。
God is much higher than us.。
God is much higher than us.。
God is much higher than us.。
God is much higher than us.。
I use these two photos。
to explain what is disdainful.。
This photo。
is taken with my dog。
when we were playing.。
My dog is a smart dog.。
I really went to class with him。
and got his certificate.。
But no matter how good he is,。
I do research, I watch TV,。
or I listen to music,。
I will not explain to my dog.。
Because his。
cognitive ability is limited.。
Every time。
I teach him。
some knowledge from a higher level of wisdom。
to a lower level of wisdom,。
I call it a "discourse".。
I can teach him to do things。
he can't do normally.。
For example, I can teach him。
not to pick up food from the table。
and eat it when it falls to the ground.。
Just like in the Olympic Games,。
the chess competition,。
the chess players。
can train the horse to dance.。
The horse doesn't know how to dance.。
From a higher level of wisdom。
to a lower level of wisdom。
to teach and pass on some knowledge。
is called "discourse".。
The same reason,。
God gives people。
the highest level of creativity,。
gives us the smartest rationality.。
I use this yellow circle。
to represent people's rationality.。
If God's wisdom is infinite,。
then we can't。
be as smart as God.。
God's wisdom is far。
higher than our mind.。
God's wisdom is far higher than our mind.。
God's wisdom is far higher than our mind.。
If God's wisdom is infinite,。
then it is impossible。
to try to describe。
an infinite God。
with human's wisdom。
and rationality.。
So,。
when Thomas Jefferson。
said a very important。
principle,。
God creates human's rationality,。
human's rationality。
cannot create God,。
human's rationality。
can only create God and images.。
I want to say it again.。
God creates human's rationality,。
this small rationality,。
human's rationality。
cannot create an infinite God,。
human's rationality。
can only create God and images.。
I will give you。
a few examples to explain。
what Thomas Jefferson said.。
The most famous。
"Fortnite Theorem"。
is the "Theorem of Music".。
Music is a 18th century。
Scottish philosopher.。
Many modern。
philosophers and philosophers。
use similar。
theories to try。
to prove that God is。
bad.。
What did he say?。
If God is good,。
he will not allow。
evil and sin in the world.。
If God is all-powerful,。
he has the ability to。
stop evil and sin.。
But in fact,。
the world is full of evil and sin.。
So, he used。
the "Fortnite Theorem"。
in the very small circle。
to deduce that if God is good,。
he is not all-powerful。
because he has no ability。
to stop evil and sin.。
So, they used the。
limited wisdom of people。
to deduce a God.。
Their God said。
God cannot be all-powerful。
and good at the same time.。
This is what Thomas Jefferson。
said very clearly.。
People use their limited wisdom。
to try to describe an infinite God.。
God can only produce a false god.。
This false god cannot be all-powerful。
and not all-powerful.。
God cannot be all-powerful。
and not all-powerful at the same time.。
This is the most exquisite observation。
of Thomas Jefferson.。
Not only this,。
there are also。
such stories in the Old Testament.。
When Moses went to Mount Sinai。
to receive the Ten Commandments,。
the Israelites。
were making gold bulls。
at the bottom.。
This gold bull was not an idol.。
This gold bull was a gift。
from the Israelites.。
They wanted a God。
who could produce。
and understand。
God.。
A God。
who can produce,。
control。
and understand。
God。
cannot be a true God.。
It can only be a false God.。
This is the explanation。
of Thomas Jefferson's observation.。
There are so many human rationalities.。
They are all made up rationalities.。
To try to explain the infinite wisdom of God,。
we can only make a false God.。
So you can see。
that whether you don't believe。
God's wisdom,。
believe God,。
but believe God in your own way,。
the Israelites。
also produced a false God.。
Their conclusion is also a false God.。
Now many people。
are also making a false God.。
They are trying to。
infer God's wisdom。
from the rationalities of the people.。
You may have heard of this question.。
If God is omnipotent,。
can he make a big stone。
that he can't lift?。
Whether it is a big stone。
that cannot be lifted,。
or a car,。
what he wants to say is。
if God is omnipotent,。
can he not be omniscient?。
If we turn this into。
a sentence,。
if A is God,。
B is omnipotent,。
he asks。
if A is equal to B,。
can A not be equal to B?。
This is a theory。
based on human limitations.。
Where is this question?。
If A is equal to B,。
can A not equal to B?。
This is a question of the question itself.。
Because this question itself is not logical.。
A question that is not logical。
is not a logical answer.。
So when people think they are very smart,。
and try to infer an infinite God。
with human rationality,。
they can only come up with。
such a mistake.。
We often get stuck here.。
In fact, if people think clearly,。
all the miracles of Jesus Christ。
cannot be understood。
by human rationality.。
So we actually need。
God's inspiration。
to understand。
God's inspiration.。
God's inspiration,。
I call this part "exceeding our rationality".。
It is God's inspiration.。
So God's words,。
God's deeds,。
are what we need to accept.。
Even if we accept。
God's inspiration,。
we only know。
infinite God a little more.。
We will never fully understand。
this God.。
Because if we really understand this God,。
we will only be。
a false God in this larger area.。
So people in this area。
often be a false God.。
People who are willing to。
accept God's inspiration。
and exceed their rationality。
to accept and believe in God。
are only a little more intelligent.。
We will never fully understand God.。
So we need to know。
where our limitations are.。
How to pursue truth?。
There are ways to be faithful to others,。
ways to be faithful to God.。
In the past,。
there were Heraclitus of Helium,。
Buddha, Confucius, and Lao Tzu.。
These are all great people.。
They pursued truth all their lives,。
and tried to find the truth。
through many years of life experience.。
But why did they find the truth?。
Because they were not the truth.。
This is also pointed out。
by Thomas Lembke.。
These people。
have pursued the truth all their lives。
because they were not the truth.。
We can see in the Bible。
that Jesus Christ。
was baptized。
at the age of 30。
according to the Old Testament.。
He was baptized at the age of 30.。
At first,。
he claimed that。
he was the way, the truth, and the life.。
He claimed that。
he was the only way, the justice。
between him and the Father and the eternal life.。
He was the truth itself.。
He was the source of life.。
Life was like the Lord of our lives.。
In John 1,。
the first chapter,。
"The beginning of the world is the way,"。
this "way" is about Jesus Christ.。
Because Satan,。
after Jesus Christ ascended to heaven,。
about 5 to 60 years later,。
he subdued his knowledge。
of Jesus Christ。
and wrote down。
John's Gospel.。
At that time,。
his other disciples。
had all died.。
Only John's Gospel。
and the Book of Mormon。
were left.。
It is mentioned here。
that the first creation。
had this "way" and this "truth."。
This "truth" is Jesus Christ.。
This "way" and this "truth"。
are in the same place with God.。
This "way" is God.。
What does it mean?。
We usually think that the truth。
is the philosophical thought。
found by some intellectuals.。
It is wrong.。
Here it tells us。
that God is the true essence of truth.。
God is the truth of life.。
God is the absolute truth.。
And the absolute truth。
is the truth。
because God is the true essence of truth.。
The opinions he expresses。
and the words he speaks。
are the truth.。
He has the light,。
and it becomes reality.。
This is God's ability.。
He is the truth.。
What he says will happen.。
So, everything is done by God.。
God also announces。
that the whole universe。
is done by God.。
Here, especially Jesus Christ,。
the Holy Trinity,。
everything is done by God.。
Everything is done by God.。
His life is in Him.。
He is the source of life.。
Life is the light of man.。
But the light shines in darkness,。
and man does not shine in light.。
If we look at this chart,。
God is in the absolute world,。
in the eternal world,。
free and eternal,。
justice, holiness,。
love and the true essence.。
When he led Jesus Christ。
to create the universe,。
the world of creation,。
Jesus Christ claimed。
that he was the Alpha,。
the Creator,。
so the whole human history。
is in the hands of Jesus Christ.。
From the eternal world of God。
to the world of his own creation,。
Jesus Christ。
is the one who created。
the universe.。
He is the only way to return to eternity.。
So in the Bible,。
we should not be surprised。
by some very clear proclamation.。
For example,。
in the book of Timothy,。
there is only one God。
in the middle of God and man,。
there is only one God,。
and that is Jesus Christ,。
who was born for man.。
There is no salvation other than him,。
because in the world of man。
there is only one God,。
and that is Jesus Christ.。
So we can see that。
science is just a part。
of the pre-made wisdom,。
and the pre-made science。
cannot prove the wonder of God.。
So you can see that。
even if we go back to the theory of the big explosion,。
all scientists cannot go back。
to the point of the explosion,。
because for a while,。
physics cannot be applied.。
So all his theories。
of the big explosion。
started after the explosion.。
So science cannot prove。
the existence of God.。
But God himself。
gives us general and special。
instructions。
to let us know that he exists.。
The general instructions are。
his creation and to give people。
a conscience,。
to create for us to have different knowledge,。
a conscience,。
so that we can develop religion and science,。
but most importantly,。
God gives special instructions,。
special instructions,。
God gives the Bible,。
God's words,。
and Jesus Christ's coming to tell us。
what God is like.。
So God's existence。
is not proven by science,。
so there is no need for。
any scientific evidence.。
Science cannot prove。
the existence of God or not.。
God's existence is。
God's own manifestation.。
The Bible says so.。
The Bible says that God's righteousness。
is manifested in the voice,。
God's anger is manifested in heaven,。
God's things are manifested by God himself.。
It is not that people look for God,。
people cannot find God,。
but God finds people.。
But people usually need to see。
the results of God,。
understand rationally,。
then believe,。
like a goldfish,。
and then believe in God.。
But the Bible has a very strange principle,。
that is, by faith,。
not by eye,。
I will explain later.。
Let's look at the results.。
The Bible says that。
Jews need to see the results,。
and the Hebrews need to seek wisdom,。
that is, to understand rationally.。
People are like this now,。
so people need to see with their eyes,。
understand rationally.。
So some people always say,。
"Why don't you call your Jesus。
to come down and see me?。
I believe when I see him."。
So people are often trapped。
in the eyes of the eye,。
and understand rationally.。
The Bible says that。
the way out is by faith,。
not by these two things.。
Can God make people believe?。
When we look at the book of Acts,。
God separated the Red Sea。
from the West,。
and the Israelites passed through。
the desert on the other side。
of the Red Sea.。
They saw the Red Sea。
separated and they did not believe.。
They had no water,。
no food,。
and Moses had killed them.。
They had nothing to eat.。
God gave them some food。
called "Mala" in heaven every day.。
They ate it every day,。
and saw Mala and miracles every day.。
They did not believe.。
They went to the West Mountain,。
and they built a false god。
called "Bai-Kim-Nau"。
in their hearts.。
Finally, they went to the land of Canaan,。
the land of the angels.。
They sent 12 scouts。
to this new place.。
None of them believed.。
The result was very, very miserable.。
The miserable result was。
that the Israelites。
had been in the desert for 40 years.。
This generation of disbelievers。
could not enter the land of Canaan。
and the land of the angels.。
This is the miserable result.。
Can the miracle make us believe?。
In fact, everything God does。
is a miracle.。
Your and my life。
is a miracle.。
Your and my heartbeats。
do not depend on。
your and my efforts.。
You can ask God to jump faster。
or slower,。
but you cannot ask God to jump or not jump.。
It is the grace of God。
that keeps our lives going.。
Your and my existence。
is not our choice.。
But today,。
when we live and see。
the miracles every day,。
people do not believe.。
So it is useless to see the miracles.。
Is reason important?。
We need to understand that reason is important.。
But we need to understand that reason。
also has its functions and limitations.。
The reason God gives people。
is beyond other creatures.。
So reason is important.。
But we need to pay attention to。
that reason is not rational.。
Many people do not believe in God,。
but believe in the devil.。
Many people believe in eternal life。
and eternal life.。
But they tell you that。
death is like a light.。
What evidence do you have to prove that?。
No evidence.。
It is not rational.。
Many people believe in themselves。
when they are not sick or cold.。
But when they have symptoms,。
they hope to have a miracle.。
Right?。
So atheism is also irrational.。
God's existence does not matter。
whether I believe in him or not.。
It does not matter if I say he exists or not.。
Reason has limitations.。
I just explained that。
people's reason is limited.。
A limited reason。
cannot understand。
this infinite God.。
We need to rely on enlightenment.。
So our common mistake is。
people's limited reason and。
selective wisdom。
limit God's enlightenment.。
This human reason。
becomes a difficulty。
to understand God.。
I just gave three examples.。
The theory of music.。
Can God be human?。
This is a theory that。
the stone cannot lift.。
This is a theory that。
God's enlightenment。
is limited.。
God's enlightenment。
is limited.。
God's enlightenment。
is limited.。
God's enlightenment。
is limited.。
God's enlightenment。
is limited.。
God's enlightenment。
is limited.。
God's enlightenment。
is limited.。
God's enlightenment。
is limited.。
God's enlightenment。
is limited.。
Some people say whether to believe or not。
does not matter.。
Look at the Bible.。
God's existence or not。
does not matter to people's subjective opinion.。
God does not exist。
because I believe in him.。
God does not exist because I do not believe in him.。
So whether you and I。
believe God exists or not。
does not matter to people's subjective opinion.。
We are trapped。
in the theory of a person.。
We just pretend to be a God.。
We just pretend to be a God.。
There is also a choice problem in the theory of God.。
I once gave a lecture。
to a brother.。
He told me。
that he believed。
in many of Jesus'。
miracles.。
The only thing he did not believe in was the resurrection of Jesus.。
I looked at this picture.。
All of Jesus'。
miracles。
are accepted。
in the theory of supernatural.。
If people have a choice。
whether to believe or not,。
I cannot see the whole。
enlightenment of God.。
Even in the Bible,。
some people ask me to。
give a blessing, I will listen.。
Some people ask me to change。
my sinful behavior,。
I do not want to listen.。
People have a choice.。
Wisdom is not unimportant.。
God gives us。
the highest rationality.。
So we。
have to use up。
God's wisdom.。
After using to the limit,。
we have to open our minds。
with confidence。
in this supernatural。
realm to accept God's。
inspiration.。
God's infinite wisdom。
limits our understanding of God.。
God may want to。
show us the whole。
light.。
If we wear colored glasses,。
we can only see a part of it.。
This is our rationality that limits us.。
So we have to open ourselves。
to see everything.。
Do not rationalize it like a partition。
between God and us.。
I just talked about faith.。
The faith we talked about。
is the ability of people。
to believe and not to believe.。
The faith we talked about。
is not a student telling his mother。
that he is very hard-working in studying。
and has confidence in his exam.。
Our faith has three。
points.。
Our faith。
is limited to our faith in God。
and。
God's words,。
which is God's inspiration.。
This is limited to this part.。
Our faith is in rationality.。
We have to understand。
that we have to believe in。
the part that is beyond rationality.。
After we understand。
God's words,。
we have to。
obey。
and turn God's words。
into the power of life change。
to change our lives.。
Because faith is infinite.。
So the faith and repentance。
are two sides of a coin.。
Sometimes God calls us to repent。
and we see heaven.。
God says faith is eternal.。
Faith and repentance。
are two sides of a coin.。
It is the same meaning。
that eternal life and seeing heaven.。
The third point of faith。
is that our faith。
is based on God's faith.。
I believe in God's words.。
I have to understand。
and obey God's words.。
The most important thing is that I believe。
not by my ability,。
not by how much I can believe。
and how much you can believe.。
It doesn't matter if we believe or not.。
God is also faithful.。
So we put our faith。
in God's faith。
because God's faith is unchanging.。
So the Bible tells us。
that when God。
gives His word,。
He is holding it。
to give His word.。
Because you and I are not reliable.。
Only God is reliable.。
In the whole gospel,。
only God is faithful.。
He can speak。
and do things.。
He is unchanging.。
His faith is unchanging.。
So our faith。
is based on God's faith,。
not our ability to believe.。
We don't believe at all.。
We feel it will change.。
But God's faith is unchanging.。
I just said that。
the general revelation is related to the universe.。
I won't talk about it here.。
The special revelation is that。
God is holding the Bible。
and Jesus Christ。
to be born.。
This is a belief based on evidence.。
There are different people。
in the religious community。
who have done different statistics。
on the meaning of the Bible。
and have already accepted a part of it.。
One of the things。
that I have calculated。
is that there are。
about 2,500 languages in the Bible.。
Some count。
more than 1,800 languages.。
I use this calculation。
to say that there are。
about 2,500 languages,。
and more than 2,000 of them。
have already been born.。
So our faith。
is not based on estimates.。
We are based on God's words。
and God's faith.。
Because God。
tells us that。
whether we agree or disagree。
in education,。
whatever God says will happen.。
So in the book of Genesis,。
God says, "I have told you。
from the beginning of the world,。
from ancient times to the end of the world,。
that my plan。
must be established,。
that I must achieve。
what I have set out to do.。
It doesn't matter whether you believe it or not.。
God will do what He says."。
This is the foundation of our faith,。
the faith of God.。
God does not rely on people。
to find Him.。
God Himself。
shows Himself.。
How does He show Himself?。
He chose Israel。
as His teaching tool.。
He chose a nation,。
told it's words to this nation,。
and then led this nation。
to be glorified by the whole world.。
His goal is to show。
people,。
to let people know that He is the only God,。
and no other gods.。
He emphasizes that。
He chose Israel。
because it is His sovereignty.。
So you don't need to ask。
why He chose Israel.。
God says, "Because it is My sovereignty,。
it is My choice."。
God chose people。
for the purpose of。
telling us。
about the creation of God,。
blessing and help。
in front of us.。
If we listen to God,。
we will be blessed。
by the revelation of。
the good and righteous justice of God.。
If we don't listen to God,。
we will be deceived.。
There are three important messages。
in the Bible.。
First, I talked about God's creation,。
then the fall of man,。
the punishment,。
and the salvation.。
I will not go into too much detail。
about the Bible,。
about sin and salvation.。
Today I mainly want to talk about。
how the Bible proves。
that God's existence is not based on science,。
but the Bible itself,。
God's own judgment.。
I mentioned the source of sin,。
so I won't spend too much time on it.。
The most important thing I want to say is。
that God solves the problem of human sin.。
You and I are both sinners.。
But it doesn't matter if you are comfortable or not.。
God told us that we are sinners.。
Because you and I know how to lie since childhood,。
we don't need anyone to teach us.。
We even lie to the point。
that we have no concept of sin.。
We don't feel ashamed.。
The sin of man is not just the sin of action.。
Jesus Christ explains that。
when you hate someone,。
you commit a murder.。
You are guilty of the first crime,。
which is to kill someone.。
You are guilty of the second crime,。
which is to kill someone.。
The first crime starts from the heart.。
I hate someone,。
maybe I don't dare to kill him。
because I don't want to go to jail。
or I can't beat him.。
I hate someone for a lifetime,。
I hate someone for a lifetime.。
I have a guilty conscience against others,。
I have committed a crime.。
Jesus Christ said that。
the heart is the starting point,。
the heart of God.。
So each of us is a sinner。
but God is just and loving.。
God said that。
no sin will be judged,。
but God did not kill anyone.。
So God arranged。
a redemption for us.。
He said that。
even if you kill someone,。
you have committed a sin,。
and you have to be punished by God.。
But God gave us a grace。
that we can be clean。
by following Jesus' old ways.。
How to do it?。
We can't be atonement for ourselves.。
God sent his only son,。
Jesus Christ,。
a man without sin,。
a man who has the same flesh。
as you and me,。
who has been tested and has not committed a crime,。
to become a redemption,。
a sacrifice,。
a salvation,。
a high-quality。
without sin,。
a high-quality without inferiority.。
He used this atonement。
to atone for others.。
He ate the blood of Jesus,。
shed the blood,。
and covered the sins of others.。
As long as people believe。
in the God Jesus Christ。
as their Savior,。
they can be called righteous.。
This is the reason why。
the Bible says "to be clean by faith".。
The reason is that。
you and I are not good people,。
we are bad people, we are sinners.。
But when we go to the cross,。
Jesus died for us.。
We admit Jesus,。
we admit that we are sinners,。
we admit that Jesus is our Savior,。
and we accept his salvation.。
This means that we add our sins。
to Jesus Christ,。
and die on the cross for us.。
At the same time,。
Jesus is the only one。
who is a man of the Holy Spirit.。
He added his sins。
to us like a garment,。
and covered us。
with his blood.。
He covered our shame。
and made us。
sinners as innocent people.。
This is the reason why。
we should be clean by faith.。
So the most important thing。
is that the Bible says。
that this Savior,。
who created you and me,。
not only created you and me,。
but also made you。
and me into human beings.。
So God loves the world,。
and even bestowed。
his only begotten Son to us.。
Let us believe in him,。
not to die, but to be eternal.。
This is God's love for us.。
The salvation of God。
is completely the same。
from the beginning of the world。
to the end of the world.。
When Noah committed a crime,。
God had already said。
that the offspring of a woman。
in the future。
is Jesus Christ.。
Because Jesus Christ is a holy man,。
he has no male father.。
The offspring of a woman。
in the future。
is his foster father,。
not his biological father.。
He is a holy man,。
so the woman is Jesus Christ.。
When God wanted to。
drive Adam and Eve。
away from Eden,。
God killed an animal。
for Adam and Eve,。
a bloodthirsty swine,。
to make a leather。
for Adam and Eve.。
This leather is to cover。
Adam and Eve's shame。
from the crime,。
to foretell the future.。
In the Bible,。
"The man will repent of his sin,。
and our sin will be added to。
Jesus Christ, not our own sin."。
Jesus Christ is like a wedding gown。
to cover our shame.。
This is the meaning.。
There are more than 300 languages。
in the Bible。
that are related to Jesus.。
For example,。
in the 600s and 700s。
before the communion,。
it was said that he was。
born of a woman,。
born in Bethlehem.。
In the book of Isaiah 53,。
there are many detailed descriptions。
of Jesus Christ.。
He will be despised,。
he will suffer a lot,。
he will be oppressed。
and we will be safe.。
Because of his oppression,。
we will be saved.。
He was a criminal,。
he was oppressed,。
he was buried,。
he became a prisoner,。
and so on.。
In the Bible,。
in the book of Matthew,。
this Savior came。
and asked us to repent.。
He has two reasons.。
He wants to。
collect the。
useless fire。
and burn it.。
It means that。
he came to save us。
and then to judge us.。
Jesus Christ came twice.。
The first time was the cross。
to save humanity.。
The second time was the judgment.。
He gave us a chance to repent.。
So when people want to。
have a miracle,。
to see,。
to have a wisdom,。
to understand God's solution。
to human sin,。
there is no mercy.。
There is only a cross.。
This cross represents God's salvation,。
God's love for humanity,。
forgiveness and grace.。
It represents the death of the world。
and the resurrection of the world.。
The resurrection is the。
certainty of eternal life.。
So Jesus Christ is resurrected.。
This represents love.。
The Bible also mentions。
that it is rare for people。
to die for others.。
Some people die for others,。
some for others.。
But Jesus Christ died for us。
when we were sinners.。
God's love。
is manifested to us again.。
Today we are sinning against God.。
God loves us.。
He speaks to us in tongues。
and asks us to repent.。
This is God's love.。
So the cross represents。
God's salvation,。
God's wisdom,。
God's mercy,。
Jesus Christ himself。
suffered all the evil of human sin。
and suffered alone。
to save us.。
What is faith?。
I just explained。
the object of faith,。
the characteristics and the basis of faith.。
In the Bible,。
there are two more things to mention.。
First, the grasp of the judgment,。
the proof of the truth。
of the truth of the cross.。
If we look at this chart,。
we are here。
in the year of our life.。
We are here now.。
People's eyes。
can only see。
what is in front of their eyes.。
We don't know what will happen。
tomorrow.。
But the eyes of faith。
can transcend time and space.。
Because our faith。
is based on God's words。
and God's truth.。
What is the unseen thing?。
What is the unseen thing?。
From the beginning of the world,。
the Bible tells us。
how God created。
and how he led。
the Israelites。
to spread the word of God。
to the whole world.。
All the prophecies。
that have already happened。
have not been seen by us.。
But we believe。
they are God's words.。
There are still many。
unfulfilled prophecies。
that are。
something we are looking forward to.。
For example, Jesus will come back to judge.。
We know that。
he will come back。
based on God's truth.。
So this faith。
is beyond time and space.。
I want to emphasize。
that this faith is not。
what you and I believe.。
Our faith is based on God's words.。
God's words and God's words.。
The foundation is God's truth.。
What God says。
has nothing to do with our belief.。
What he says will definitely happen.。
So what has already happened,。
although I am not there,。
I believe.。
So based on the eyes of faith,。
it is beyond time and space.。
Because of this reason,。
Hebert Rice said。
a very important thing.。
We understand that。
the universe is created by God's words.。
This is the point.。
The point of the Big Bang.。
It really has a Big Bang.。
Scientists can't explain it。
because of physics.。
But because of faith,。
we know that God created it.。
This is what。
can be seen by the eye。
is created from what can't be seen.。
The universe that can be seen。
is created from the God。
that can't be seen.。
The matter that can be seen。
is created from the energy。
that can't be seen.。
Because of faith,。
we see very broadly.。
Beyond time and space,。
we have to understand a lot.。
I don't need to be there.。
I know because God told me.。
And what God said will definitely happen.。
We have to believe.。
So our faith is much bigger。
than people's rationality.。
All God's work。
is in the part of super rationality.。
All God's work is in this part.。
If we just keep ourselves in this part,。
we will never see God's greatness.。
Abraham。
we call him the father of faith.。
The God and his。
herds。
can't be seen in the whole life.。
The God told him。
"The herds of the people。
are blessed because of you."。
This "herds" refers to Jesus Christ,。
the Savior.。
He appeared in the。
2,000 years of the cross.。
He can't be seen in the flesh.。
What did Jesus say?。
He said in the Gospel of John,。
"Abraham rejoiced。
and looked up at the days。
when he saw joy."。
How did he see?。
His faith is the spiritual vision.。
We believe God's words.。
So when God speaks, I believe.。
So Abraham。
looked up。
and saw the Savior.。
Although he couldn't see him。
in the flesh,。
he saw him with faith.。
His national land。
was built.。
When the nation。
was in the Jerusalem,。
he was no longer in the world.。
He had faith.。
He believed God.。
This is the reason why he had faith.。
The Bible says。
faith is beyond time.。
The faith we talk about。
is not what you and I think.。
It is God's word.。
It is God's word and the faith based on God.。
One thing is very important.。
It is the resurrection of Christ.。
We have never seen it.。
Neither have you and I.。
The resurrection of Christ.。
The Bible says。
the resurrection of Christ.。
Who was Paul?。
Paul was the leader。
who led people。
to persecute the Christians.。
Until the resurrection of Christ,。
Paul was the only one。
who was resurrected.。
Paul was the only one。
who was resurrected.。
Paul said in the Bible。
I have been faithful and have given you。
the most important thing.。
The most important thing is。
that Christ is as recorded in the Bible.。
It is not what people say.。
It is as recorded in the Bible.。
It was said in the Bible.。
He died for our sins.。
He was buried.。
It is as recorded in the Bible.。
He was resurrected in three days.。
We read it in the Old and New Testament.。
Jesus Christ predicted three times。
that he would be killed and resurrected in three days.。
Then he emphasized。
that the resurrected Christ。
would be Jesus Christ.。
The 12 disciples。
would appear.。
The 12 disciples。
would appear.。
The 500 brothers would appear.。
The son of Jesus would appear.。
The disciples would appear.。
The son of Jesus。
would appear.。
He was the least of the few.。
He was the one who was disowned.。
Many people。
went to the temple to see。
the 12 disciples.。
Except John,。
who wrote the book of Ephesians。
and John's letter to John.。
All the other disciples。
were Christians.。
One of the disciples。
was called Thomas.。
Thomas was also。
a Christian.。
Christianity has a very important meaning.。
It is the Kingdom of Israel.。
It was in 586 BC。
which is equivalent to。
the Spring and Autumn Period in China.。
It is described in detail.。
It is described in detail.。
The Israelites were thrown。
from heaven to earth.。
They were driven to various countries。
and humiliated.。
They were separated in 2600。
and in 1900.。
They were separated in 2600 and in 1900.。
It is mentioned in the Old Testament。
that those who were exiled would return to their homeland.。
There was no country in the world。
that was able to。
return to their homeland。
after 2600 years.。
There was no country in the world。
that could return to their homeland。
after 2600 years.。
So, before 1948,。
many people could still。
laugh at the Bible.。
After 1948,。
we could not。
laugh at the Bible.。
Jesus Christ。
resurrected.。
Many believers。
witnessed。
the resurrection of Jesus Christ.。
One of them was Thomas.。
Jesus Christ resurrected。
for the first time in the Gospels.。
Thomas was not present at that time.。
When the other Gospels told him,。
he said, "Unless I personally。
touch the nails of Jesus,。
I will be saved."。
When Jesus Christ was resurrected for the second time,。
he asked Thomas to touch his wounds.。
Thomas knelt down。
and told Jesus,。
"My Lord, my God."。
Why?。
Because Thomas no longer used his limited。
human wisdom to block。
God's revelation.。
He understood that Jesus Christ was God.。
Jesus Christ then told him,。
"You see me and believe,。
but those who do not see and believe。
have the good news."。
"What kind of people are these?"。
Jesus Christ said,。
"Jesus Christ told us。
that we were not there。
when Jesus Christ was resurrected.。
Jesus Christ told。
those who did not see。
and believed。
that Thomas was there.。
You believe me,。
and you have the good news."。
That's all for today.。
Thank you.。
Take care.。
