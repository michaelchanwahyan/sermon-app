Thank you, thank you so much, Tim. Thank you, everyone.。
I'm so happy to be back in Yuen Long.。
I don't come as often as I want,。
but every time I come, it seems to have changed,。
a lot more new people, so I'm really excited to be here.。
Today, I am going to continue in the series that you've been in,。
and the title of the message is。
"Are you willing healing in community?"。
I'm going to first start and talk about a story about。
when we got COVID. How many people can relate?。
Okay, so most of you didn't get COVID.。
Anyway, COVID started in 2020, as we all well know,。
and my family and I, like most people, did everything not to get it,。
especially in Hong Kong, right?。
You didn't want to get it, you didn't want to go to quarantine,。
you didn't want to be isolated,。
and we were successful until 2023, last year.。
Just before everything was lifted, we got COVID.。
In 2022, I was pregnant, so I didn't want to get COVID。
because that would have been a disaster,。
but God was faithful, He kept us without COVID until last year.。
The whole family got COVID, and our helper was very sick,。
my kids were sick, we were all sick,。
but my husband was testing negative, so he had to go to work.。
(laughter)。
So I remained with the whole family, our helper was very sick,。
so she couldn't do anything.。
Even though I was sick, I had to be the strong one。
and take care of my children and take care of the helper, right?。
And because we couldn't see anyone, I really felt overwhelmed.。
I remember on day two, I felt overwhelmed, I felt like crying,。
and for the very rare times, I felt sorry for myself.。
I felt isolated, I felt like nobody was there to help me,。
and I just felt helpless at that time.。
So I know many of you have got similar stories,。
maybe even worse stories, right?。
Maybe some of you were isolated for longer, for us it was seven days,。
maybe for you it was 14 days, 21 days, or even longer during that period.。
This actually made me realize how relational we are.。
I'm an introvert, by the way, but we are still very relational people.。
So I'm going to read today from Mark 1, verse 44,。
and it says, "A man with leprosy came to him and begged and came to Jesus."。
So when it's saying him, it came to Jesus.。
"A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees.。
'If you are willing, you can make me clean.' Jesus was indignant.。
He reached out his hand and touched the man.。
'I am willing,' he said. 'Be clean.'。
Immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.。
Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning.。
'See that you don't tell this to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest,。
and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing as a testimony to them.'"。
In this passage, we see a man with leprosy.。
In the Bible, this was a chronic infectious disease, and it was incurable.。
Because of its devastating effects on the skin,。
leprosy in the Bible was feared as much as COVID or more.。
And you can imagine, because the people with leprosy would probably have it for years.。
And in the Bible, in Leviticus 13, verse 45 to 46,。
it describes how lepers were required to stay outside the camp。
and cover their mouths to say that we are unclean.。
Now, I was feeling overwhelmed, and I was feeling so sad,。
with seven days of separation and isolation.。
Now, imagine a person with leprosy.。
Not only were they separated from everybody else in society,。
but they were separated from their own family.。
I was feeling sorry for myself, and I was separated with my family.。
Now, imagine a person with leprosy.。
They were not allowed to contact anyone as long as they had that disease.。
You were unclean as long as you had the disease,。
but afterwards, you would go through a purification process。
and verification process with the priest.。
That's why Jesus said, "Go and show yourself to the priest."。
He had to fulfill the whole purification process.。
When you had leprosy, it didn't only affect your body,。
but it affected you emotionally.。
You were not supposed to be close to anybody,。
so you were not interacting emotionally with anybody.。
You were not allowed to work, so it affected your livelihood.。
In fact, it affected every area of your life--。
your social life, your health, your livelihood, your emotions.。
It was not just the physical.。
So when we read this passage, sometimes we just think of the disease.。
But like my experience with COVID, it comes with a whole lot of other things.。
When Jesus touched this man and restored his health,。
he also healed him emotionally.。
He healed him socially. He healed him financially.。
Jesus restored this man back to community。
because he was willing to reach out and touch someone society said should not be touched.。
Today, we are saying, "Are you willing?"。
Jesus is willing.。
In this place, maybe there are people here who feel isolated.。
In any one of those areas, maybe emotionally you feel isolated.。
Maybe financially you feel isolated.。
Maybe socially you feel isolated.。
In whatever way you feel isolated today,。
Jesus is willing to touch you in those areas.。
In the passage above, we see that the man with leprosy had to go to Jesus.。
Jesus was willing to touch him, but the man had to be willing to seek out Jesus.。
I believe we are all willing here because we've come only for that name,。
for the name of Jesus. Amen.。
So Jesus is willing, but are we willing?。
A lot of the time, sometimes we isolate ourselves。
and we don't reach out to Jesus for different reasons.。
Sometimes we are so scared that what if nothing happens?。
Sometimes a lot of things block us from reaching out to Jesus.。
But today my question is, are you willing to reach out?。
Some of us here are feeling lonely or isolated,。
and Jesus is willing to touch us.。
We need to break down the walls we have built around us。
and allow Jesus and other people in.。
Today, COVID may be over, but there are many other things。
that isolate us from community and finding our healing there.。
When God made us, he made us in his likeness,。
and God by nature is relational.。
We were never meant to live in isolation or loneliness.。
God's heart is that everyone who is isolated in any way,。
whether physically, socially, emotionally, and mentally,。
is restored back to him and back to community.。
The loneliness statistics after COVID are staggering.。
I mean, when I was looking after at these statistics,。
they are staggering, especially for Gen Z.。
I don't know if everybody knows who Gen Z are.。
Okay, Gen Z is the generation--I think it ends 2012,。
those born 2012, between about, I think, maybe 1990 to 2012.。
That's Gen Z. Anyone here in Gen Z?。
Oh, wow. Okay. Not as many. Okay.。
I'm not Gen Z, by the way.。
1990 to 2012, my daughter is Gen Z.。
And in this generation, it's the most hard hit。
because the statistics say loneliness is at its peak。
between the ages of 18 and 30,。
with 30% to 50% of this age group feeling lonely.。
The effects of isolation of COVID are still being felt,。
whether emotionally, mentally, or even in physical health.。
God says the lonely in families.。
This is Psalm 68, verse 6.。
It says, "God says the lonely in families.。
He leads out the prisoners with singing,。
but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land."。
He places the lonely in families because this is God's heart.。
He wants everybody who feels lonely to be in a family.。
And you being in this church, it means if you are in this church,。
or you want to join this church, this is your spiritual family.。
God has led you to be in this family, so you are not lonely.。
I'm going to read from 1 Kings 19, verse 15 to 18, and it says,。
"The Lord said to him, 'Go back to where you came from.'"。
Here we're talking about Elijah.。
"The Lord said to him, 'Go back the way you came,。
and go to the desert of Damascus.。

and the community group I spoke about earlier.。
There are times I've also prayed for other people.。
There are times I've also been strong spiritually.。
There are times I've also spoken into people's lives.。
In those times, it doesn't mean we will always get everything right,。
and we will have conflicts sometimes,。
but it means we believe we all have good intentions。
and truly want the best for each other.。
Needs are different, and we won't always have the answers for everyone,。
and thank God we don't have to because God does have the answers.。
But we have to be willing to be that place where people can come to,。
and not just people who have it all together.。
We have to be willing to be that place where the broken come to.。
We have to be willing to be the place where the vulnerable come to.。
We have to be willing.。
Sorry, I get emotional when I think of this.。
We have to be willing to be the place where the lonely come to.。
We have to be willing to be the place where the marginalized come to.。
This is not just the place where people who have it all together come to.。
We have to be open and see the people society shuns.。
We have to see them because a lot of the time it's hard to see those people.。
It's hard to see the people that God wants us to touch。
because they're hiding in the shadows because they've been shunned by society.。
We have to be willing to be those people.。
The widows, the orphans, the widowers, those who are sick,。
those who are marginalized, those in need.。
We have to reach out if we are willing.。
Sometimes they won't come, so we take the steps to step out。
and touch those like Jesus did.。
It takes a deliberate act and a willing heart。
to reach out to those in society who need it the most.。
Jesus, when he was on earth,。
he deliberately sought out those who were marginalized like in Mark 1.。
Those who were sick, those whose society shunned,。
to be low, to be more like Christ.。
It's to do the same.。
We need to love like Jesus.。
We need to let the love of God flow through us to those around us.。
It is through God's love that we are able to reach others in need and community.。
We need God's love.。
We need to reach out.。
You know, the Bible says, "They shall know you for your love for one another."。
We start here in community, here in the church,。
love for one another, meeting each other's needs.。
Then we go out there and they see the love.。
They see the love in our hearts.。
That's how they'll be able to tell the difference.。
Through our love, through our love for each other.。
Today I want to pray for us.。
And I really sense the first thing I want to pray today,。
and I'm going to ask us to all stand.。
The first thing I want to pray for today,。
I really sense that there are a lot of people who are saying,。
"I need the love first in order for me to give out that love.。
I need that love first."。
So I don't know where you are, but if you're comfortable, if you can open your hands.。
You're saying, "I need that love.。
I want God to pour out that love in me first.。
I need that love to heal me."。
It says, the word says, "Perfect love casts out fear."。
Fear of being in community, fear of being that community.。
God's perfect love casts out that fear.。
Today I want to first pray for that love.。
Oh Lord, you're such a loving God.。
You're such a loving God.。
Through your love, you heal.。
Through your love, you heal us, Lord.。
Today I just want to pray, Lord, that you would touch。
each and every person who needs your love this morning.。
Pour out your love today.。
Pour out your love today.。
Pour out your love today.。
Oh, to overflowing Lord, that we may be that community that people need.。
There is so much need in the community, my God.。
There is so much need.。
But Father, I pray that you would heal us to be able to heal other people.。
Because healed people are so grateful and they reach out and heal others, Lord.。
I pray that you would create communities in this church, Lord,。
that will be able to help each other, bring each other closer to you,。
heal each other in the name of Jesus.。
I pray, Lord, that we become the communities that are not just closed up。
because now we're healed, but we become the communities that are open。
and begin to see the vulnerable people in community, Lord.。
I pray that people begin to know that this is a church full of your love。
and they are drawn to you.。
They are drawn to you, Lord, in this place.。
I pray, Father, that you would bring, bring, bring all the people who need healing in this place.。
Bring all the vulnerable people in this place.。
May we not shun people of any kind, my God.。
I pray that you would draw people to yourself in this place。
and people's hearts will be ready in here to receive the people you send。
in the name of Jesus.。
I pray for healing of relationships in this place.。
I pray for healing in community, my God.。
I pray for healing for anyone who's been hurt in this community.。
I pray for healing for people who've been hurt in their families.。
Maybe there was no love in the family.。
Father, I pray for that healing in Jesus' name.。
You're a God who loves and I pray that you would pour out your love。
into each and every person who needs that love today in the name of Jesus.。
Maybe some people have felt marginalized even in this place.。
Father, I pray that you would break down every wall and every barrier。
and everything that separates people in this place in Jesus' name.。
Father, people have been even hurt maybe in the city.。
Father, I pray for your healing balm over every single person in this place.。
Father, touch each heart, Lord.。
You came to heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds in Jesus' name.。
I thank you for your healing, Lord.。
I thank you for your healing in this place.。
I thank you for your healing in this place.。
Thank you, Holy Spirit.。
That you're even speaking to people in here about the communities they should join.。
Thank you, Holy Spirit.。
You're touching the hearts of people in this place.。
I thank you, Holy Spirit.。
I thank you, Holy Spirit.。
Today, I want to challenge us to find someone。
whether in this place or elsewhere, I challenge us to find someone to speak to today.。
Ask them how they're really doing.。
Sometimes we come to church and we put a facade that everything is okay。
when everything is not okay.。
We say, "How are you doing?" We smile and we say, "I'm okay."。
But inside, we're not okay.。
But today, I want us to go to someone。
with the intention of finding out how they're really doing.。
How they're really doing.。
Let us be willing to open up and say how we're really doing.。
If you're tired, say, "I'm tired."。
If you're stressed, say, "I'm stressed." Please pray for me.。
If you're overwhelmed, say, "I'm overwhelmed." This is what's going on.。
Let's be willing to listen to people.。
Let's be willing to be that place.。
Sometimes just listening brings the healing.。
Somebody just needs that listening ear.。
Let's be willing today to be those people。
as we become the community that heals each other through the grace of God.。
So Father, we thank you for this healing series.。
We thank you, Lord, for each and every person that's in this room.。
For each and every person that spoke.。
All the pieces to the puzzles that have come together.。
Father, we thank you.。
For each and every person you've used, we thank you.。
We thank you even for Pastors Tim and Ivan.。
We thank you for Pastors Chapman.。
We thank you for each and every person.。
We thank you for every volunteer, every full-time staff.。
We thank you for each and every person who comes to the prayer.。
Every person who serves on a Sunday.。
Every person who is contributing to the community。
that is bringing healing to others in this place.。
We thank you for every community group leader.。
All the sacrifice that they bring.。
We thank you, Lord, for each and every person。
who has reached out to somebody in need in this place.。
We thank you, Lord, for those you have sent out in this place。
to bring healing to other people.。
We thank you that you're strengthening them.。
We thank you that you are even bringing healing to them that they need.。
We pray for physical healing.。
We pray for emotional healing.。
We pray for financial healing.。
We pray, Lord, for each and every type of healing in the name of Jesus,。
even socially those who feel isolated.。
We pray, Lord, that you would heal them too,。
that they may be able to do more work out there in the name of Jesus.。
Father, increase your healing in this place in the name of Jesus.。
We thank you, Lord, and we bless your name in Jesus' name.。
Amen.。
What a powerful message.。
And as a response, I just want to sing this song。
so that we really make room in our hearts for the Holy Spirit to work in us.。
And for those that are in need,。
may we just surrender to God's inkling on our hearts。
and be obedient to what the Holy Spirit says.。
