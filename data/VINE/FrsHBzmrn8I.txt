Amen. Thank you, Jason.。
Let's give Jason a round of applause.。
That was a great leading.。
And congratulations to June.。
June has been accepted.。
I'm so touched to see her being selected。
and to see how she has helped us improve our book.。
Congratulations to everyone.。
Because today is the last day of the audition.。
I don't know how you feel about the last 21 days of the audition.。
I heard everyone was sharing their experiences.。
The two ladies next to me were sharing their experiences.。
I was talking to them.。
And I found out that they had some experiences.。
Maybe we'll share them together later.。
Today is the last day of the auditions.。
I don't know how you feel about the last 21 days of the audition.。
What do you feel when you start the audition?。
What do you expect?。
I remember when I first started this year,。
and I wrote the book for the first time,。
I was looking forward to what God would say to me.。
Especially last year,。
when we entered a new stage of life.。
My wife and I were both thinking,。
we were both servants,。
we were both thinking,。
"After marriage, how will God use us?"。
"How will He serve us?"。
"How will we use the past two years?"。
I still remember the first week,。
when we started to eat lunch,。
I simply couldn't believe。
how God would keep talking to us that week.。
I was looking forward to every day of prayer,。
because you never know what God will say to you the next day.。
It was like God was giving us His will every day.。
Not only in the proclamation,。
but also when we were in our lives,。
when we were going through struggles,。
God was slowly showing us.。
I remember when we were 15, 16 years old,。
we were making decisions,。
and we didn't know how to apply them.。
God was actually opening doors for us,。
to give us a chance.。
When we were worried,。
and we were looking for something,。
when we were talking about how to deal with things,。
we received a phone call,。
and God was slowly opening doors for us.。
On the one hand, we were very excited,。
God was talking to us like that.。
On the other hand, we were looking forward to。
what would happen the next week.。
Would there be someone to give us a service offer?。
Or what?。
But when I went into the prayer the next week,。
the direction, the content of the prayer,。
even the tone was very different.。
God made me think of many people,。
many things,。
many passages from the past sermons,。
many points,。
or many emotions, many thoughts.。
The last time I had a speech,。
I was asked many questions.。
"God, do you really want me to do this?"。
"God, God,。
how can I fix these complicated relationships?"。
"My life's problems, my life's struggles,。
have been going back and forth for so many years,。
and they are repeating over and over again.。
How can I find a way out?"。
"In this state, I can still serve you."。
"What if I hear wrongly?。
What then?。
What should I eat tonight?"。
This is not it.。
But as a servant, as a missionary,。
the questions I just asked,。
it seems like you have a basic answer,。
you should know some answers,。
but they are very real.。
These are the struggles I had that week.。
These are the weeks。
that I think about,。
or the situation inside me,。
the real situation.。
Richard Foster,。
in "The Early Morning Prayer,"。
quoted a poet to describe prayer.。
He said, "When we pray,。
God will slowly, gently,。
show us our hidden,。
or our so-called life situation,。
and reveal our life."。
Yes, I think it's very real.。
When we pray with all our heart,。
when we know,。
we will know more and more。
about the light of our life.。
Life is not just a place with light, right?。
It also has a shadow.。
Our life is not always。
full of beauty.。
Sometimes,。
or many times,。
our life,。
or the world we live in,。
our spiritual life,。
is full of tension,。
full of struggle.。
Our life is sometimes full of two sounds.。
One is,。
"I only know that God is love.。
I know that I want to be immersed。
in a relationship with God.。
I also want to hear God say every day,。
"I am in Him, I am valuable.。
We also have a mission.。
We are also people.。
God wants us to love,。
to serve,。
to touch.。
But on the other hand,。
we know that our life is full of problems,。
many difficulties,。
or some very difficult,。
very annoying things。
are inside us.。
We need to face and deal with them.。
They can be。
some very complicated dynamics in front of you,。
some very complicated relationships,。
or some situations that we love,。
our family members,。
or our loved ones,。
or some unknown things that are ahead of us,。
or some unfinished things in our lives,。
some relationships,。
our self-doubt,。
or even some harm that we don't want to be aware of,。
or even some sins.。
These two voices bring us tension,。
bring us inexplicable anxiety,。
and even。
entangle us in our prayer。
of how to listen to God.。
In a small town in Spain,。
there was a young pastor。
who received a phone call on Friday night.。
He was preparing dinner with his wife.。
While preparing, his wife said, "I'm going to listen."。
He went out to listen.。
When the pastor was preparing,。
he was looking back at。
the habit he had been repeating。
for a long time.。
He was meeting an old pastor。
as his mentor.。
The pastor suggested that he pray。
for an hour every day.。
After his wife came home from work,。
he would pray for an hour at home.。
He would spend time with God every day.。
He would listen to God's words.。
He would confirm his call.。
He would confirm that he would serve God.。
He was thinking that he would share a lot of things with his wife.。
After a while, he thought,。
"Why hasn't my wife come home yet?"。
He went out to listen。
and looked at his wife.。
At that time, his wife was holding her phone.。
She didn't say a word.。
She was like listening to her phone.。
The whole hall was quiet.。
The only sound was the voice。
from the phone.。
The pastor thought it was strange.。
He picked up the phone and listened.。
When he listened,。
he was not a stranger.。
He was a friend of his.。
He was a very familiar friend of his.。
He was actually a friend of his.。
When he listened,。
he was scolding them.。
He did a lot of things to hurt them.。
Do you know how he hurt other people?。
He even said something that he didn't remember.。
He kept scolding them.。
He only remembered the last sentence.。
He said, "You don't have to look after me and my family anymore."。
Then he stopped.。
At that time, he didn't know how to react.。
He listened to the phone and looked at his injured wife.。
He had a lot of questions.。
They didn't eat the dinner that night.。
They finished their work and went to bed.。
But they couldn't sleep.。
The pastor was thinking, "What happened?。
What did I do wrong?。
Why did you scold me like this?。
It's not fair.。
Why can this happen to us?"。
He couldn't sleep that night.。
He was even thinking,。
"In this place, there are so many things,。
I have so many problems,。
so many hurts.。
How can I continue to serve God?。
How can I continue to walk?。
Yes, we will struggle in our lives.。
I don't think anyone can do better than that.。
Even a person who serves God can't do better than that.。
Even if we have so many good experiences in the Bible,。
sometimes when a small thing happens,。
a small movement appears,。
it can easily overthrow our previous experience。
and bring a lot of struggles to our lives.。
When I think about this week。
or these three weeks of my Bible experience,。
I think about what kind of people are in the Bible,。
or even Jesus,。
how he experienced these struggles,。
how he faced the times when he struggled in his life.。
I think of the Gospel we are going to read today.。
Although Jesus is the God of all things,。
but he took the form of a human being to come to this world.。
He is also a man of all things.。
He will face struggles in his life.。
He also has feelings.。
When he faces the people who are against God in the Bible,。
he will be angry.。
When he faces his beloved Lazarus,。
he will be sad.。
When he faces those who are against God,。
you don't understand how to teach them.。
He will be annoyed.。
When he faces those who are in the midst of hardship,。
he will feel sad.。
But the Bible says,。
even if it is Jesus who has different struggles。
or different feelings,。
the Bible says that Jesus never committed a crime.。
He is a man who never committed a crime.。
He has experienced many trials,。
but he never committed a crime.。
Today, we will use Jesus' last sermon.。
Before he was captured,。
Jesus' last prayer。
is to use this sermon to see how God。
will tell us how to do in the midst of struggle.。
Let's pray together.。
