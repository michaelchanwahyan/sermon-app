What do you see when you worship? What do you focus on when you step into the space?。
Do you see the band sometimes and just admire them? Do you see others and think about the。
relationship you have with them? Maybe you have friends here and you step into the space and you。
really wanted to connect with your friends. Do you see yourself out of place maybe trying to fit in。
or do what everyone every other one is doing and try to worship as other worship? My worship wasn't。
the songs that I sing. My worship was not the way that I posture myself. My worship is the way I。
broke down and I told God that I can't sing anymore. My heart is not ready yet but my tears。
are coming out because I know your love for me is real. And I just want to tell you when you come。
into the space today, when you come in and you see friends and you see the team and you see。
everything happening so wonderfully, also take a moment to see what God is talking to you. What is。
he showing you and revealing to you? When we say that true worship is not about saying the right。
thing, when we say true worship is the response we make, when our hearts are moved by his revelation,。
what is he revealing to you today? Is he telling you about his holiness?。
Is he telling you about his greatness? How is your heart moved today?。
