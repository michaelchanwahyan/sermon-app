Good morning everyone。
My name is Alex。
I am the Executive Director at Branches of Hope。
For those of you who might not be familiar。
with who we are。
We are the NGO founded by the Vine Church。
some 13 years ago now。
We serve refugees, asylum seekers。
as well as people who have experienced。
situations of human trafficking。
and labor exploitation。
Our mission is to restore the dignity。
justice and hope。
of these people through the。
three pillars of our service。
Care, empowerment。
and social awareness。
Now, you might be wondering。
why you're listening to me today。
Actually I'm here as a matter of。
tradition if you will。
Over the years, the Vine Church。
has dedicated one Sunday a year。
to Branches of Hope。
and this has more recently become。
known as BOH Sunday。
In fact, we had BOH Sunday at the Vine。
Wanchai just two weeks ago。
at which Taz gave a beautiful message。
on Agape, the。
love of God, and Cheri served。
on the worship team。
For us, it's a way to connect。
with a wider congregation at the Vine Church。
Church members like yourselves。
are our most important。
supporters and partners。
and so in keeping with this established。
tradition and retaining our connection。
to the wider Vine community。
this is our third BOH Sunday。
at Yuen Long。
We would love to be there and see you all。
face to face and weather permitting。
we'll come up to visit you very very soon。
Let's dive right。
into today's message。
by letting me ask you all。
a question。
I'd like you to think about your families。
your places of work。
anywhere where you spend a significant。
amount of your time。
in the presence of others。
Now, here's the question。
Does anything come to mind, any situation。
any relationship, any rule。
that you think isn't fair。
just isn't right。
Think about it for a moment。
Now, let me specify。
my question。
Does anything come to mind。
that is unfair to others?。
Let's be honest。
when I asked the question initially。
without specifying who to think of。
most of us, and I count myself。
I include myself in this of course。
would have been inclined to have thought about ourselves。
Maybe。
the thought that came to your mind was that。
annoying thing your family member does。
over and over again。
or your thought was the last minute assignment。
that your boss or teacher gave you。
or maybe you thought about the bus driver。
who, even though he could see you running。
and waving, still closed the doors。
on you。
So how does it change your thinking?。
How does it change your。
posture when I ask。
you to consider this question on behalf。
of somebody else?。
What does this say about your role in society。
and, more importantly。
in God's kingdom?。
Today, as part。
four of the Stewarding Our Lives sermon series。
we will take a look at becoming。
a restorative presence。
Often, we struggle。
to connect our faith and our work。
Our work, paid。
or unpaid, in the home or in the office。
outside。
consumes a huge part of our lives。
Many times, the main way。
that we connect our faith and our work。
are in a few simple ways. For example。
earning money to give to God's kingdom。
sharing the gospel。
in the workplace, or just。
being ethical at work。
While these three ways of。
connecting our faith to our。
workplace hold true and are important。
what I hope to do today is to provide。
a deeper, biblical understanding。
of the purpose that God has。
for us in our work。
I'm particularly。
grateful to Pastor Tim to。
providing us the stage and suggesting。
this particular day and topic。
as one to center BOH Sunday in Yuen Long。
around. Indeed, I'd like to think。
that as an organization。
or at an institutional level, Branches of Hope。
is a restorative presence。
to the community that we serve。
and as an organization。
we offer an avenue to channel。
and amplify the restorative presence。
of others. But before。
we get into that in more detail。
let's open this week's scripture passage。
Turn with me, if you will。
please, to the book of Acts。
chapter 6, verses 1。
to 7, where it says。
"In those。
days, when the number of disciples。
was increasing, the Hellenistic。
Jews among them complained about the。
Hebraic Jews because their widows。
were being overlooked in the daily distribution。
of food.。
So the twelve gathered all the disciples。
together and said, 'It would not be。
right for us to neglect the ministry。
of the word of God in order to wait on。
tables. Brothers。
and sisters, choose seven men。
from among you who are known to be full。
of the spirit and wisdom.。
We will turn this responsibility over。
to them and will give our attention。
to prayer and the ministry of the word.'。
This proposal。
pleased the whole group.。
They chose Stephen, a man full of faith。
and of the Holy Spirit, also Philip,。
Prochirus, Nicanor, Timon,。
Parmenas, and Nicholas from Antioch。
to convert to Judaism.。
They presented these men to the apostles。
who prayed and laid their hands。
on. So the。
word of God spread. The number of。
disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly。
and a large number of priests。
became obedient to the faith.。
This is an exciting period。
in the history of Christianity. The number。
of disciples was increasing. God's。
kingdom was growing. But。
as with any growth or scaling up,。
there were some challenges.。
I'm sure there were many other societal。
problems at the time, but in this passage。
our attention is drawn specifically。
to the hunger of Hellenistic Jewish widows。
that stemmed from a systemic。
problem. For。
context, being a widow in those。
days meant much more than。
having to deal with loss and。
grief. Even those things on their own。
are just terrible. It meant。
your entire social support。
system had collapsed.。
Since husbands were expected to be。
duty-bound to be the providers,。
when they passed away, the responsibility。
was often delegated either to the husband's。
brothers or to。
the eldest son in the family.。
Now, imagine。
if there were no brothers,。
or perhaps if there was a son,。
the son was not old enough yet。
to earn a living. Or maybe。
the family just refused outright to carry。
that responsibility.。
As a result, many widows。
were extraordinarily vulnerable and。
reliant on charity and handouts.。
Now clearly, this。
was already a recognized problem that。
was being addressed with the food rations.。
However, whether intentionally。
or not, we don't see that necessarily。
from this particular passage.。
The verses make it。
clear that the Hebrew-speaking。
widows within the community were being given。
preferential treatment over their。
Greek-speaking counterparts.。
So you can really see how。
in a broken world,。
even acts with good intentions。
can aggravate injustices.。
Our sin blinds。
us not to recognize。
when we act out of a place of。
prejudice or out of a place。
of favoritism.。
And so it becomes systemic.。
We mean well, but it causes。
more problems. And so being a。
restorative presence。
is crucial to consciously counteract。
this tendency.。
There are three points that I want。
to focus our attention on here that allow the。
twelve to bring restoration。
to the widows. Firstly,。
they recognize that the pursuit of their goals。
was creating a negative,。
unintended outcome.。
And they refused,。
secondly, they refused to ignore the problem。
because they knew doing so would。
undermine the purpose of the work that they were engaged in.。
And lastly,。
they found simple, relatable,。
and pragmatic means of solving。
the issue.。
There are two important lessons that we can。
learn from this.。
The first is this.。
Pursuing an end,。
even a holy one,。
is empty if the means are not。
righteous also.。
Can you imagine if the early church。
would have just kept on going how they were doing things,。
how they were distributing the food, and what。
negative impact this would have had over time?。
As。
Christians, the end should never。
justify the means.。
For we may。
quickly risk losing our way.。
There are many cautionary tales。
in the church's over two thousand。
years of history, including horrible,。
unspeakable transgressions like the Crusades,。
or more recently, the subjugation。
of indigenous people. We do not。
need to be as dramatic as citing these。
particular transgressions either.。
Maybe you too。
can think of a situation where。
you had the best intentions,。
but ultimately the outcome backfired and was。
less than holy.。
But the more relevant lesson, I think,。
for us in conjunction with the Stewarding Our Lives。
sermon series, is the question。
about how we connect our faith and our day-to-day。
work, and。
today's topic of。
restorative presence, is this.。
Furthering the pursuit。
of God's kingdom is not。
just about worshipping。
and hearing God's word on a Sunday,。
as good and as wonderful as those things。
are. Pursuing God's。
kingdom is possible。
with very real, earthly,。
pragmatic means。
by our presence and how we do our work.。
This includes, for。
example, identifying and acknowledging。
and responding to a problem,。
practicing the division of。
labor and delegation, relying。
on the power of the body of。
Christ. We all have our strengths。
and weaknesses, but only Jesus can do everything。
by himself.。
Recruiting people with the right qualifications。
for a given task, and of course。
offering everything that we do up to God。
in prayer.。
The choosing of the seventh story。
from the Bible is highly。
relevant to our world today, the work。
we do, and how it connects。
to faith.。
The story has elements of management,。
human resources, resource。
allocation, due process, and prayer.。
If you think about it,。
the problem, though serious,。
required a simple。
administrative response。
in the pursuit of wider strategic。
objectives.。
The clients, in this case the widows,。
complained. Management, in this case。
the twelve, put their heads together。
and promptly came up。
with an issue, or resolved the issue, with an。
appropriate reallocation of internal human resources,。
in this case the chosen seven.。
Does this not。
sound something like your places。
of work? The kind of situations。
that you face on a daily basis?。
And yet it was a profound。
and beautiful act of faith。
in the pursuit of God's kingdom.。
The point is this.。
We all have the power to be。
a restorative presence because。
of our identity in Christ.。
The chosen seven were。
physically present,。
and through their presence were able。
to take the actions that brought。
restoration to the widows,。
to the Hellenistic Jewish widows.。
Sure,。
what we do is important.。
It is certainly not Christ-like to。
pursue careers that, by design, exploit。
people or damage our environment。
without any mitigating measures.。
But how we do。
what we do is just as important.。
Even what seems like a mundane。
administrative act。
can become a powerful expression。
of faith in the pursuit of God's kingdom。
if we choose to do it out of。
love and as a form of worship.。
Now, let's take a pause。
for a moment because I'm sure that。
all of this can feel a bit overwhelming for some of us.。
You might be sitting。
at home right now and thinking to yourself,。
"Sure, how I。
do my work or how I conduct myself。
on a day-to-day basis can be used。
as an act of worship,。
but who actually cares?"。
Or maybe you're thinking, "But I'm just one。
person. What difference。
does it make?"。
Believe me, in my line of work,。
I struggle with these questions。
all the time.。
Especially around impact,。
around purpose.。
What is the point?。
We are confronted with a broken world,。
immeasurable needs, and finite。
resources. I can help。
these two people, but。
what about the other hundred that are。
going without any resources?。
Let me tell you this.。
The odds。
don't matter.。
The statistics。
don't matter.。
And to some extent, even the outcome does not。
matter.。
The most important question is this.。
What is your posture?。
Do you believe in the power of God。
and his plan for humanity?。
Do you believe this world。
will be broken forever?。
Because if you believe。
Jesus will come again one day,。
then there is only one logical conclusion.。
Each and every one of us。
must continue to serve with whatever。
abilities and resources we have.。
The battle we are in may。
be hard, and granted,。
we may not be able to see its conclusion,。
but never forget, the war。
has already been won.。
Only by serving may we。
share in the victory.。
Let me share。
a very personal thing。
with you for a moment, and maybe this will。
be helpful to some of you.。
I have often felt。
overwhelmed by the brokenness of。
the world, and struggled with periods。
of anxiety because of it.。
One really important principle I have learned。
in managing this is。
understanding that my sphere of interest。
is not the same。
as my sphere of influence.。
I am concerned。
about the world at large,。
but I certainly cannot influence it.。
I cannot change it.。
So, should I give up?。
Or, should I shift my focus。
to the things that I can influence?。
It's easy to be。
overwhelmed by the world, but remember this,。
the bigger picture is。
God's domain.。
By partnering with Him, you get。
to let go of all of that,。
and focus specifically on what you。
can do, and how you do it.。
Think of John。
chapter 1, verse 5, where it。
says, "The light shines。
in the darkness, and the darkness。
has not overcome it."。
Even if you are the only。
light in a sea of darkness, it already。
makes all the difference, because darkness。
is defined by the absence of light.。
So,。
if we accept the limits of our spheres of influence,。
how do we become。
a restorative presence in our work?。
It includes three primary practices.。
Firstly,。
being rooted in Christ.。
Before we go about the work of restoration。
in the world, we must be people。
of God, and allow。
God to renew our hearts.。
Secondly, being a。
cultivator of community.。
Now, this serves two functions. Firstly,。
to be a restorative leader, we need to。
be in a community of support。
and encouragement, but we。
also need to be creators。
of community, providing the。
resourcing, the support, and the flourishing。
to all.。
And lastly, being an advocate。
of justice in systems and structures.。
We're called to be leaders。
who don't just address。
injustice that results from an individual。
action, but from collective,。
institutional, and systemic practices.。
In other words,。
no matter what our main。
professional purpose。
in life may be, and I include in this。
frankly, being a。
stay-at-home parent, for example, or。
being a stay-at-home spouse, or。
a student at school, or university,。
so not just traditional。
things that we would consider to be。
work, but what you spend the majority。
of your time with.。
In all of these circumstances, you can。
be a restorative presence。
by being rooted in Christ,。
choosing to cultivate community,。
and being an advocate for justice.。
Put in even more plain terms,。
furthering God's kingdom。
is not just about what you do。
on a day-to-day basis,。
how you do it is equally。
as important.。
I want to dig a little。
deeper into this relationship between。
the what and the how,。
and more importantly, the importance of。
the how.。
In the story of the choosing of the seven,。
worrying about the。
food rations of the widows。
was definitely not the primary。
objective of the twelve.。
It was not their "what", if you will.。
Their focus was。
instead spreading the gospel.。
That was their main objective, that was。
the "what" of what they were trying to achieve.。
So, let's apply。
then the three practices of being a。
restorative presence. Number one,。
I think we can safely assume。
that the twelve are rooted in Christ. I think we can。
just put that aside. So, number two,。
cultivating。
community. They made a conscious。
choice to cultivate their community。
by including the needs。
of the Hellenistic Jews.。
And number three,。
they then advocated for systemic。
change, for systemic justice。
by improving the food distribution system.。
This was part of how。
they approached the "what" of。
their purpose, the ministry of the Word of God.。
They knew that。
going after that goal was not going to be。
possible if they did not change。
how they were doing it on the side.。
It's easy to recognize。
the importance of what they were doing and therefore。
easy to understand the significance。
of how they were going about it.。
But, let's take a look at scenarios。
where the "what" may not be as。
comparatively important。
as spreading the gospel.。
Maybe you're asking yourselves this question。
right now.。
Is what I'm doing even relevant。
to the Kingdom of God?。
To furthering the Kingdom?。
If that is you, may I。
gently challenge you to turn。
your focus away from what。
you're doing and。
instead embrace how。
you're doing it as a way。
to glorify God.。
Being in the light of God is not only determined。
by what you do, but how you。
do it.。
Let me give you another personal。
example. In my role as。
Executive Director at Branches of Hope and in my。
career in humanitarian aid, you might think that I'm。
filled with purpose。
and pursuing objectives that are close to God's。
heart. That I recognize。
ultimately the restorative presence。
of my person and the organizations。
that I've worked for.。
The truth though is that。
for a big part of my career, I was unable。
to see it that way.。
I fixated on the fact that。
I was not a doctor, I was not a nutritionist,。
I was not an agricultural。
expert or a community mobilizer or a case。
worker. I agonized。
that I did not have any technical。
expertise to contribute,。
nor did I feel that I was doing anything really。
that had an immediate tangible connection。
to the communities I was there to serve.。
I managed。
and coordinated programs,。
which meant, in essence,。
paperwork, reports,。
plans, meetings,。
emails, and generally。
just administrative work.。
I was, and。
still am, a generalist.。
Or as some cynics might say,。
a jack of many trades,。
but a master of none.。
It wasn't until much later, with the。
help of incredible mentors and coaches。
in my life, that I began to see the importance。
of being a generalist and that being。
a generalist was a God's gift.。
Being a generalist。
means being able to build。
bridges and connect。
people and perspectives.。
As I began to embrace my。
gift, I started。
to pay more attention to how。
I was doing my work.。
A meeting, for example,。
was an opportunity to cultivate community.。
Reviewing a。
proposal or a report was an opportunity。
to ask the hard questions about。
systemic injustice.。
More recently, in thinking。
about how I do my work, I tried to。
model servant leadership and。
focus on the quality of my interactions with people。
around me. You might call it。
taking a people-centric approach.。
But the point is that。
as a follower of Christ, I challenge myself。
to recognize the needs,。
the ambitions, the interests, and constraints。
of my colleagues, to recognize them。
as people first, and。
to work with them, not against them.。
In so。
doing, I would like to think that I am a restorative。
presence in my workplace, though, of course,。
you can take some time to ask my colleagues themselves.。
That said, I must also confess that I。
sometimes fall short of these ideals。
and let my emotions get the。
better of me.。
But by the power of the Holy Spirit, I recognize。
my faults and I summon the courage。
to correct and apologize for them.。
The moral of my。
story is this.。
Ironically, I was only。
able, really, to take satisfaction in。
what I was doing。
after realizing the importance of。
how I was doing it.。
Maybe you are feeling unfulfilled。
because you are just。
a paper pusher, or。
just a stay-at-home parent,。
or just a student.。
You don't see what impact you're having.。
But think for。
a moment about the people God has。
placed around you, your family,。
your friends, your colleagues,。
even strangers on the street.。
How you。
relate to them can be more powerful。
than what you do.。
Ask yourself what injustice。
they might be facing, and what。
role you can play in addressing it.。
You can cultivate community。
with them, you can cry out。
for the injustices they experience,。
and you can be a restorative presence。
in their lives.。
Now, as I wrap up,。
beyond what。
the book of Acts, chapter 6,。
verses 1-7 teaches us,。
one thing I like about。
this particular passage is how。
it mirrors the story of Branches。
of Hope. Branches of Hope。
may not have been founded by the Twelve。
or run by the Chosen Seven,。
although I will say that our founders,。
John Snellgrove and Tony Reed, are old enough。
that they were probably around back then.。
But we were birthed out。
of a ministry of divine church。
in response to systemic injustice。
in our society.。
And that continues to be how,。
as an organization, we continue。
to be a restorative presence in the。
communities we serve.。
We talked about what it takes to be a。
restorative presence today.。
The three primary practices of being。
rooted in Christ, being a cultivator。
of community, and an advocate。
of injustice, or an advocate of justice.。
We also talked。
about。
what you do not being the only important。
thing, but that how。
you do it carries a proportionate。
amount of importance.。
I hope that this has。
encouraged you to become a restorative。
presence in all of your everyday。
situations.。
Of course, if you'd like to amplify。
your restorative presence, one way。
you can do that is by partnering with organizations。
who are rooted in Christ, which。
cultivate community, and which。
do the work of advocacy。
by highlighting the injustice in systems。
and structures. In other。
words, partnering with organizations like。
Branches of Hope that have a restorative。
presence in Hong Kong.。
That sounds like something that you would like to。
explore. I invite you to talk。
to us the next time that we are in New Long.。
More than anything, we need people to sign up。
as regular monthly donors.。
Any regular amount will help us provide financial。
stability to hundreds of people.。
If just five people。
among you were to sign up today。
to give $100 a month, that would。
mean that we could support another person through。
our STAR Fund, our。
monthly financial assistance program.。
Of course, you may also choose to。
support some of our other programs, for example,。
our education services or our。
general service fund.。
You can make a one-off donation or you can sign up。
as a volunteer. And you can。
also walk with us in prayer. We have some。
prayer guides available as well.。
Now,。
lastly, I would like to close。
us in prayer. So,。
if you'll bow your heads with me.。
Lord,。
I pray that my message。
today has achieved its。
intended purpose of。
helping us discover fresh。
ways to participate。
in your creative, redemptive。
and healing work。
of making all things new.。
May the message today。
have glorified you。
by contributing to the。
broader aim of this sermon series。
of helping us find deeper meaning,。
hope, vision。
and courage for the work。
that we do in our daily lives.。
I pray that we recognize。
the inherent value of how we go。
about our daily work,。
be it in the workplace, be it at home。
or in the school.。
Lord,。
please show us in all situations。
how we can further your kingdom and be。
a restorative presence.。
Please guard our steps。
and keep us on your path so that。
in the pursuit of your kingdom。
we may never stray。
and get lost in the brokenness of this world.。
Lastly, Lord,。
I pray that the Holy Spirit should。
show all of us, just like。
he showed the apostles and how he has been。
showing branches of hope, how we。
can be facilitators of community。
and advocates of justice.。
Help us recognize。
not just the struggles。
of those around us。
but also how you desire for us。
to partner with you to address them.。
Help us be the light。
in the darkness.。
Amen.。
Thank you, Yun Long. We're looking forward to seeing you real soon.。
Thank you for。
such an inspiring message, Alex.。
We hope that。
you are also encouraged by the message.。
We hope you're encouraged and we pray。
that the Holy Spirit will come and guide you。
to bring his restorative。
presence back to wherever you are.。
We pray that the Holy Spirit。
will help us bring his。
will, his justice, and so on。
back to our environment.。
So that's it for this week.。
We hope we'll see you again next week.。
Thank you for joining us.。
See you next time.。
Bye-bye.。
Bye.。
(upbeat music)。
you。
