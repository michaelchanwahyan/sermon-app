So good to have you back, right?。
Yes, come on.。
[Applause]。
Yeah.。
Well, when I was in university,。
I was very proud。
because I made。
the men's basketball team.。
I know.。
[Laughs]。
And on my team, there was actually。
incredible players. They were really good.。
One of them, so much so that。
every summer, he。
practiced with NBA players.。
So it was like he, I was living in the。
Northwest, at that time, there was the Seattle。
Supersonics, they now moved to, I think, Oklahoma City。
or something. And so he。
was playing with some of those players.。
Now,。
on the men's team, there usually。
was seven。
or eight players that got to play。
most of the time.。
I was not one of them.。
So it was the other ones。
played. Now, the first year, I was okay。
with that. You know, the other players are better.。
That's fine. Fantastic.。
You know, go ahead.。
Second year,。
there was one guy。
that was playing my position who。
was in that eight-person。
rotation. And I felt like。
that I had the。
similar skill set as he did.。
And I。
started comparing myself to him.。
And as。
I was doing that, I was like, you know,。
I really。
would deserve to have。
a spot and be able to。
play and be in that rotation.。
At the very least, I should get。
the opportunity to prove myself a few。
times. Why does he get to。
play? Why don't I get to play?。
And so I started to。
complain and。
grumble inside my heart。
as I compared myself.。
Now, before that,。
I was actually feeling great. I was so。
proud to be on the team.。
But when I started comparing, all that went out the window.。
Isn't that interesting how that。
goes, right? Like when you start。
complaining, like maybe。
something that we enjoyed before, something。
else good, suddenly doesn't。
seem that good anymore.。
Now, we all experience that.。
You know, whether that's。
in your workplace, in a relationship,。
in。
church.。
You know, in all these different。
places we experience that. That's when we。
start comparing ourselves, we get。
tunnel vision.。
We start focusing in on what the other person。
has that we don't have that we should。
have.。
And we kind of lose joy。
along the way. Like we stop。
seeing the good things that。
God is doing in our lives.。
And a lot of times, there's a lot。
of negative emotions。
with that as well, right?。
And so what I want to do with you today,。
I want to explore with you a question is。
how can we break。
out of or。
escape from this。
pattern of comparing。
ourselves with others that。
brings us down? You know, how。
do we get out of that? Because it's。
so destructive and。
it's like kills our joy.。
You know,。
what do we do? And what does God's。
word have to say to us about that?。
So we are。
in a new sermon series。
that we have entitled "Living。
the Kingdom Parables."。
And Jesus, if you're familiar。
with him, I think like 30 or 40 percent。
of the words in the Bible。
from him are actually parables.。
So it was one of the major ways that he。
taught. And for those。
of you who are not so 100 percent sure about what is。
a parable, that sounds。
interesting, but what is this? Here's a little。
definition. A parable。
is a comparison that employs。
an ordinary circumstance。
in everyday life to illustrate。
a spiritual truth.。
So Jesus uses everyday examples,。
but with that he's actually。
illustrating, you know,。
a truth about something else.。
And。
in this series we're going to look at five different。
parables. Parables。
also, they tend。
to provoke us.。
They tend to stir some emotions in us。
because there's something in them that。
rubs us the wrong way. And it's。
usually right at that point。
where we are rubbed the wrong way。
that God wants to say something。
to us. That's why Jesus uses。
them because they're so powerful.。
And so I'm really excited about this series。
and the heart behind it。
is that we can align。
ourselves with a kingdom。
mindset, with kingdom living.。
With the things where we are。
not aligned with God's。
will, Jesus' desire for us,。
his followers, his disciples.。
Now in just。
a moment we're going to look at the parable。
of the laborers in the vineyard.。
But before。
we get there。
I want to set a little bit of context.。
Actually。
there's a lot of things that。
could be said about the context. It's a lot more。
than I usually would do, but I'm going to。
try to keep it very short.。
Basically there's a story。
where a rich young man。
he comes to Jesus and he wants to understand。
how can I have eternal life?。
But in the process of talking。
with Jesus。
he chooses。
his wealth over following。
Jesus and he walks away。
sad, but he's just not able。
to let go of what Jesus。
asked him to do.。
Now in response to this, Peter。
who was listening。
who has left things behind。
he's like, "Hey, Jesus!。
What about us?" I want to read with you。
actually something that he says. So it's Matthew。
19 verse 27. He says,。
"We have left everything to follow you.。
What then will be。
there for us?"。
And it's interesting。
because。
Jesus, he does tell Peter。
that there will be rewards。
for him leaving everything, that he actually。
will bless them in incredible ways.。
But he also。
tells this parable。
in response to Peter's。
question. Because there's something。
about the question, there's。
something about the comparison that Peter did。
to the rich young ruler where Jesus。
wants to say a little bit more.。
Where there's something。
else that needs to be said.。
And this is where we're going to pick up.。
So we're in Matthew chapter 20。
we're studying the response that says this,。
"For the kingdom。
of heaven is like a landowner。
who went out early in the morning。
to hire workers for his vineyard.。
He agreed to pay them。
a denarius for the day and。
sent them into his vineyard.。
About nine in the morning he went out and saw。
others standing in the marketplace。
doing nothing. He told。
them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard。
and I will pay you whatever's right.'。
So they went.。
He went out again about。
noon and about three in the afternoon。
did the same thing. About five in the。
afternoon he went out and found。
still others standing around.。
He asked them, 'Why have you been standing。
here all day long doing。
nothing?' 'Because no。
one has hired us,' they answered.。
He said to them,。
'You also go and work。
in my vineyard.'。
And when evening came, the owner。
of the vineyard said to his foreman,。
'Call the workers and pay them their wages.'。
Beginning with the last。
ones hired and going to the first.。
So the workers who were hired。
about five in the afternoon。
came and each received a denarius.。
So when those came who。
were hired first, they expected。
to receive more.。
But each one。
of them also received a denarius.。
When they。
received it, they began to grumble。
against the landowner.。
These who were hired。
last worked only one hour.。
They said, 'And you have made。
them equal to us。
who have borne the。
burden of the work。
and the heat of the day.'。
But he answered。
one of them, 'I'm not being。
unfair to you, friend.。
Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?。
Take your pay and go.。
I want to give。
the one who was hired。
last the same as I gave to you.。
Don't I have the right to do。
what I want with my own money?。
Or are you envious。
because I am generous?'。
So the last will be first。
and the first will be。
last."。
Wow.。
That's a lot, isn't it?。
So let's。
unpack that. Let's walk。
through this parable. Let me highlight。
some things along the way.。
So the first thing is, in this。
parable, it's, again,。
it's an everyday scene. It's a laborer looking。
for workers, the worker's vineyard.。
So。
people, he finds people。
in the marketplace, he tells them,。
'You want to come work in my vineyard? There's probably。
the harvest. These workers are bringing the harvest.'。
And so they agree。
to work for one denarius,。
which basically was enough money。
to pay for food for the family for that day.。
But then。
what's interesting is that the landowner。
actually keeps going out, and it's also。
interesting that the landowner does that.。
You know, it's him going。
out and hiring workers.。
Not somebody else, not one of his。
employees, but he does it.。
And so there's other people he meets, and。
they agree。
that they will be paid whatever。
is right, in verse 4.。
So he tells them, 'I'll pay you。
something that's fair.'。
And then he goes out at。
5 o'clock, which by this。
time there's only one hour left of work days.。
So work days usually were 12 hours.。
So there's only one hour left.。
And he。
still finds people standing around,。
and he's kind of confused by that. He's like, 'Why。
are they standing around? Why are you doing nothing?'。
And they say, 'No one has。
hired us.'。
Now,。
no one, in other words,。
wants them.。
When I lived in the。
US, I one time rode along with a。
contractor who actually picked up。
workers.。
You know, it was a place where they。
were waiting for work for the day.。
And it was interesting。
because the contractors, they actually get to know。
the workers. And then a lot。
of times, they know who they like to。
work with, but they also know maybe the。
person who doesn't work that。
well. And。
so, I can imagine。
in the setting, you know,。
the workers, they knew these guys, and they're like, 'Ah, we。
don't want them working for us.' So。
they didn't hire them, but they hired the other guys.。
But this landowner, he hires。
them nonetheless for one hour.。
So it's interesting. It's kind of。
something precarious, something。
that should make us curious.。
So。
at the end of the day, 12 hours。
worked. You know,。
you have people working different hours. Some。
work 12, and some work one。
hour. Now, we have。
to remember that this is a parable。
because it's。
easy to kind of lose track of that.。
So in this。
parable, the landowner is。
God, who's calling。
people into his kingdom to be his kingdom。
workers. So。
that's something we need to keep in mind as we continue walking。
through it, okay? But let's。
go on, and this is where things get。
interesting, the next part. This is where。
it gets juicy, as they。
say.。
So in verse 8 to 6,。
we see that the。
landowner tells the foreman, "Call the people。
together. I want to pay them."。
And he decides to pay them。
from those who came last. He。
wants to pay them first, and。
then pay all of them until the ones。
who started in the morning.。
Now, what's。
absolutely incredible。
is that the landowner。
pays those who came and。
worked for one hour.。
He pays them one denarius, which is。
the same that he had agreed。
upon for the others.。
And this kind of stirs。
some excitement. Actually, at this point in time,。
nobody minds that, that they're getting paid a denarius。
because。
they are expecting。
that they will receive。
more.。
But when it's their turn to pay, to be。
paid, guess what happens, right?。
We already read it. They just get one denarius.。
Ooh.。
They worked 12 hours,。
the other ones worked one hour,。
and they get paid the same.。
I don't know if you've。
ever been in a work。
situation where you do。
a lot more, maybe somebody。
else is chilling and playing video games,。
and you get paid the same. It just doesn't。
feel good, does it?。
I also,。
if this was today, I wonder。
what people would do on social media.。
Right? They might go on。
X, is that what it's called?。
Twitter, is it called X? I can't remember.。
Okay, yeah, so they go on X,。
shoot out some tweets.。
If there was Google Review, they would write。
a nasty review about this。
horrible land。
owner who is so unfair.。
And I think we can feel, we can have。
sympathy with。
that. There does seem to be some unfairness。
from our perspective, right?。
And we can feel that.。
So it's no surprise。
that they actually grumble and they complain.。
So in verse 11, we're told they begin。
to grumble against the land owner, so they're angry。
against them. And then in verse 12,。
we're told, "These who were hired。
last worked only one hour."。
They said, "And you have made them。
equal to us,。
who have borne the burden。
of the work and the heat of the day."。
You know, "Hey,。
you're making them the same as us, but we。
earned, we deserve more than them.。
We earned this, we have the right to this."。
You know, that's what they're saying.。
Like, "We're not equal to。
these other guys that nobody wanted to hire。
that just worked one hour.。
We should get more."。
And they're just ticked off.。
But I want you to notice something.。
All of this grumbling。
and frustration,。
the only reason why it happens。
is because they're。
comparing themselves.。
If the foreman would have paid。
the first-comers first and sent。
them off, they would have gotten what they。
agreed upon, right? One denarius,。
and they go and they would have been happy.。
But it was only when they compared themselves。
that they got angry and frustrated。
and felt like they were treated wrongly.。
So comparison。
can turn something that is。
good into something。
sour.。
It's like me with。
basketball. I was proud to be。
on the team.。
I felt amazing. I made the college。
basketball team.。
But then when I compared myself to the one guy。
who was like similar skill level, looking back。
he was better than me, just being honest.。
But when I compared myself,。
then I was grumbling, then I was complaining。
and suddenly something that was good。
didn't feel that good.。
And my joy。
was drained.。
But then。
let's continue the story. So the landowner。
he actually responds in verse 30, he says。
but he answered one of them,。
"I'm not being unfair to you, friend.。
Didn't you agree to work for。
a denarius?" He reminds him of the facts.。
"Take your pay and go.。
I want to give the ones who was hired the last。
the same as I gave you.。
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my。
own money? Or are you。
envious because I。
am generous?"。
Now it's interesting because。
the workers, they're actually claiming。
that the landlord is unjust and。
unfair.。
That he is treating them wrongly.。
But he's saying, "I've actually done what。
I promised you. You agree to this."。
So he's highlighting that.。
And they're。
trying to make this about a justice。
issue and he shifts。
it and he says, "You're upset.。
You're envious because I'm。
generous." So he's saying。
this is not about justice.。
This is about envy.。
This is about my generosity。
with which you struggle with,。
which you don't want for the other。
person. That's why you're upset.。
Ay-yah.。
This is where we get to the heart issue that Jesus。
wants to address.。
That he wanted to address in Peter.。
That he wants to address in us.。
He asks the question, "Are you envious。
because I'm generous?"。
And the truth。
is they are envious because。
he is generous.。
They are envious。
of the grace and mercy。
that the workers。
that nobody wants to hire。
that maybe are not as skilled,。
that look like they have a messy life,。
that maybe smell like alcohol,。
don't look。
the way we think somebody。
who is a good worker looks。
because the landowner。
showed them grace and mercy.。
And so he's saying,。
"I'm envious。
of the Lord and grace and mercy."。
That's why they're ticked off.。
Now, at this point in time, again,。
we have to remember we're reading a parable.。
This is not a workplace。
situation. This is Jesus。
using life。
circumstance to explain something else.。
And so, Jesus。
in this parable,。
as I already said, the landowner represents。
God, and it's。
actually God calling people into his。
kingdom, inviting。
them to be workers in。
his kingdom, inviting them to give。
them some work in the vineyard.。
So when you're a。
Christian, God has。
called you and he has given you a place。
in the vineyard to work, every。
one of us.。
And it is all。
by the grace and by the mercy。
of God. None of us deserve。
it. None of us are entitled。
to it. It is 100。
percent the grace of God。
that he calls us。
and that we get to be part of his。
family, that we get to be。
his workers in the vineyard.。
But the。
reason the。
early workers in this parable are so upset。
is because they have forgotten that.。
And guess what? We forget that as。
well.。
And we start actually thinking。
about our relationship with God。
a lot of times。
as we think about relationships in business.。
You know, they're transactional.。
You owe me something.。
I did this, God, and you。
owe me this.。
Why should he or she have this?。
I have。
done this. I am entitled。
to that, but you're not giving it to。
me. And so we start。
grumbling against the landowners. We。
start grumbling against God.。
And our relationship with God。
starts growing sour。
because。
we have lost sight that this。
whole thing is all by the。
mercy, by the grace,。
by the love, by the。
generosity of God.。
In the kingdom of God,。
it isn't about earning。
or deserving, but。
about receiving, saving,。
grace, and joyfully。
serving God.。
Now, what does all this have。
to do with us? I know I was。
just walking us through the story。
trying to help us understand some of the。
details a little bit better.。
But what is it that this parable。
exposes and challenges within our。
hearts, and what does Jesus。
call us to。
instead?。
Well, the first thing is。
we theoretically love grace.。
We theoretically like。
it. We like it when。
God is gracious to us,。
when he's good to us. Oh, thank。
you, God, for the promotion.。
Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.。
Thank you, God, for this that you've done in my life.。
I love you. You're amazing.。
So we love grace。
theoretically. Well, we。
start not liking it。
when God's generosity and goodness。
comes to somebody else, when it。
comes to our competitor,。
when it comes to the other family。
member, when it comes to。
what you can fill in the blank.。
So theoretically, we like。
grace, and we're like, "Yeah, I love grace. We're a。
grace church."。
But then when it actually comes。
down to it, a lot of times we don't like it.。
Is this true?。
Yeah? I think so, right?。
Come on.。
Just having an honest conversation here.。
And so perhaps。
we envy a relationship,。
a promotion,。
success, praise,。
gifts that people have,。
scholarships they've been awarded,。
favors from someone。
you can fill in the blank.。
Where have you。
envied God's。
generosity towards somebody else?。
Where do you find yourself。
being envious right now, and。
comparing yourself, and feeling。
like you are entitled,。
they shouldn't be entitled?。
And by the way, I chose a very。
safe example with the basketball team。
on purpose, you know,。
keeping it light and easy.。
Where are you。
envious right now?。
Where you feel like you deserve。
something, God owes you something.。
You know, and when we compare。
this to the legalistic。
religion within ourselves。
that actually is exposed,。
when I say,。
"I deserve this, why is God。
giving the person that?"。
Really what we're saying is,。
"I earned this."。
But as we've said,。
everything from God is something。
we get by grace, by His mercy.。
It's not something that we earn.。
We just receive it by grace and mercy.。
But so it exposes。
our heart that actually。
there's some works religion in there.。
In us.。
You know that,。
and this is what Jesus is kind of teasing out。
in Peter's heart, in his listeners。
heart, in our heart.。
And we say, "That person。
should not be of equal status to me.。
I should be of higher status.。
Because I did so and so,。
and that person is not the same as me."。
You know, and we go on and on and on.。
So you will never。
see the goodness of God。
when you envy His generosity。
towards others.。
It gives you a tunnel vision.。
You lose track of it.。
And I don't know if you've,。
you know, if you struggle with that,。
it's a real struggle.。
Sometimes it is hard to get out of that.。
And I actually want us to be compassionate。
and graceful towards one another,。
even when we find ourselves in those places.。
You know, but it's。
when you're so focused。
on what somebody else has。
and you haven't, and you feel like you deserve it,。
man,。
you start losing track of all the goodness。
of God in your life.。
You're not able to see it.。
And it's just,。
it's just not a。
good place.。
And God doesn't want us to live in that place.。
You know, He wants us to see His goodness,。
His love, His grace,。
His mercy.。
He wants you to see it.。
He wants you to know it.。
He wants you to be confident in it.。
That He is faithful to you,。
His people.。
But you will never see。
the goodness of God when you are envious。
of His generosity towards others.。
So what's the anti-door to that?。
What do we do?。
How can we get out of this comparison trap。
that leaves us being jealous。
and envious?。
Well, the anti-door。
is that we start。
practicing and seeing。
and giving thanks。
to God's goodness and mercy.。
That we cultivate this attitude。
of gratitude.。
I came up with another way。
right before the sermon, that we practice。
the art of seeing God's goodness。
in our lives.。
You know, we struggle with that.。
But when we do that,。
we start giving God thanks。
for, "Wow, God, thank you for your mercy.。
Thank you for salvation.。
Thank you for your faithfulness.。
Thank you that you are with me,。
that I know your presence.。
Thank you that I'm breathing today.。
Thank you for my health.。
Thank you for whatever God has been good to you.。
Just give Him thanks."。
You know, it's amazing when we do that.。
Now, there's a biblical scholar,。
Michael J. Wilkins.。
He defines gratitude this way.。
He says, "Gratitude is the response。
of the believing person。
to the goodness of God's grace。
in creation and redemption,。
making gratitude。
the authentic hallmark of the disciple。
of Jesus."。
So gratitude, so our thanks,。
our praise is a response。
to Jesus. And our lives。
are meant to be。
a response to the goodness, to the mercy。
of God, where we say,。
"Thank you, Jesus, for placing,。
for calling me into your vineyard.。
And I'm going to serve you in this patch。
that you put me in.。
And I believe that you have a purpose for me。
here in this patch, that you。
don't make mistakes.。
And I'm going to joyfully serve you。
and work for you. And I'm not going to be。
focused on rewards or who gets。
what. I'm just going to live。
in gratitude。
of your generosity。
towards me, your goodness towards me."。
And you know, when we do that,。
there's something really freeing.。
When we just know that God loves us,。
that we are secure, that we're。
not going to miss out, that He。
cares for us, that He has our。
back, it just frees。
us to love other people, to。
serve Him and not be concerned。
about us。
being entitled to this or to that.。
And if I only had this,。
then I'd be happy and all。
of that. And He should not have that。
and she should not have that.。
It's just amazing when we。
live in this gratitude and。
just see God's mercy, that we're just freed。
to love other people,。
to do the work of God that He gives us。
and to just enjoy His goodness.。
I was at a point。
in my life where。
this was not easy.。
It's not always easy to。
have the attitude of gratitude.。
And maybe if you're really feeling bad。
and somebody tells you, "You should have the attitude of gratitude!"。
You know, you're like,。
"Hmm...。
I don't know if I want to hear this right now."。
So I've shared。
some of the story before, but。
basically, you know,。
several years ago,。
I had significant loss of my life,。
loss of relationship,。
loss of home,。
loss of my job.。
And, you know, really。
I was like, "God, I'm。
serving you.。
I was a。
pastor. I love you.。
Why is my life。
falling apart? And why do。
people, maybe who seem like they don't care。
about you that much, why are they doing good?。
This is so unfair.。
I deserve this."。
So I was complaining.。
I was grumbling.。
And I have to say, you know, sometimes when。
just our life。
knocks us down, sometimes that's where we're at.。
You know, it's not like we can always。
ride away in。
the ideal place.。
But that's where I was.。
But it's interesting。
when we。
say, "Why do they have such a good life?"。
Actually, the reality。
is,。
do we really know that they have a good life?。
Do we know that。
they don't have marital problems?。
Do we know that they're。
not lonely in the evening。
and there's tears every night?。
Do we know。
that they're not carrying。
some baggage from the past。
that's just heavy, and that's just。
impacting them even today?。
You know, is that other person's。
life, is it really。
better?。
And because we just。
see the facade, right?。
That we are jealous of.。
And like, "Why is God generous to this person?"。
But if we actually would swap lives。
like completely,。
maybe their life is really not that great.。
Maybe God's just,。
you know, pouring out some goodness in this。
area of their lives just to encourage them, because。
the rest is so difficult.。
But anyhow, I was。
not thinking this way. You know, it's like, "Why。
do they have a good life, and。
right now my life is a mess?"。
And so I was talking to a friend,。
and I was,。
you know, sharing all this stuff with him,。
and he was encouraging。
me to see God's。
goodness. Now I have to say, he did listen to me several。
times, then only after a。
while, so this was like after three conversations。
or he started to talk to me。
about seeing God's goodness. It was not the first thing。
he told me. And。
I shared with him that there was。
a family。
that took me in.。
You know, as I had lost my。
relationship, my home, my job,。
that they welcomed me。
into their home.。
And。
my goal was, "I'm just going to be here.。
I'm going to hide in this room。
so that they allow me to stay here longer,。
that they don't get annoyed and。
want me out of the house, you know, just try to。
clean up everything。
good." But they。
didn't just want me in their house. They actually。
invited me to be part of their family.。
I had dinner with them.。
I went shopping with them.。
I went wine tasting with them,。
which was a lot of fun.。
You know,。
they just really loved。
me and embraced me in this。
difficult time where I was like。
a mess, crying and all。
of that. And。
my friend says, "Don't you see。
how much God loves you?。
How he's shown you his。
goodness in this difficult time through。
your family?。
Don't you see that?"。
Wow.。
And that, I really needed。
that because I couldn't see it on my own.。
And I could。
see God's goodness. And this was。
a turning point for me where I could。
start giving God thanks。
and。
praise him, you know, for。
his love and care for me despite。
the difficulties and challenges that were。
going on. And I was just saying, "Thank you.。
Thank you, Lord." And I started。
slowly, you know,。
naming the things in which God。
has been good to me.。
Now, when。
we have God's。
grace and mercy, you know, in view, when we。
get to see it, it is so。
powerful.。
Now, for me, there。
was this complaining against God. Now, I don't。
think that I saw God as, like, you know,。
the evil landowner who's so。
unjust to me. But it was a little bit of that.。
And it's amazing when。
we see God's grace and mercy,。
we actually can start。
seeing God again as a loving。
father instead of as that evil landowner。
who's just harsh to us and who。
messes with our lives, you know, and where。
we're upset and we're angry and we're sour.。
And he wants。
to restore that.。
You know, he wants to restore our relationship。
with him. He wants to。
restore our joy.。
He doesn't want us to live。
in this place of envy。
and complaining.。
And。
now, one thing that's also amazing about。
Jesus, you know, his saving。
work, is that he。
gives us forgiveness. Because。
actually, when we're complaining,。
when we're saying, "Why are you。
giving them that and not me?"。
You know, there's actually pride。
in our hearts.。
We actually need forgiveness for that.。
You know, and he。
forgives us and he gives us his mercy。
and his grace.。
And he actually helps us。
overcome,。
you know, that so that we can be free,。
that we can receive his grace and his。
mercy and goodness and just walk in that.。
Now, I want to invite the。
worship team to come up.。
And my sense,。
you know, for today,。
is, you know, as I shared,。
Jesus, he tells these parables。
to just highlight things in our hearts, where he's。
inviting us to have a different。
perspective. Where he。
wants to also bring healing,。
you know, the parts of our thinking,。
parts of our acting,。
that are not aligned with him.。
And。
he's inviting us today.。
He's inviting you today。
to。
respond to him, to。
come to him. Maybe。
it's asking。
Jesus, "I'm。
not seeing your goodness. I'm。
not seeing what I should。
be grateful for.。
Can you help me see it?"。
Maybe。
that's what you bring to him. And I believe。
that he will help you see it, you know, as。
you ask him for that. That he will。
show you, you know, his。
goodness. Maybe not right in the moment, but he will。
highlight that to you.。
Maybe it's, maybe God wants。
to restore。
your relationship with him. Maybe you've been。
sour, you've been bitter, you've been angry。
at God. Like, "How dare。
God do this to me? You know,。
why does he give, he's generous to them,。
but not to me?"。
And so maybe, God。
is calling some of you,。
you know, just to find healing in that。
relationship. To not see。
God as this angry,。
unfair, unjust。
taskmaster in your life,。
but as your heavenly。
Father who loves you.。
You know, who cares。
for you.。
Who just pours his mercy。
and his goodness out over you.。
And so what I, what I want。
to do right now, I just want to invite you actually to。
just talk to God right now.。
And just to talk to him about what he's。
been speaking to you about.。
And then in a little bit I'll,。
I'll lead us into what's。
next. So let's, let's do that right now.。
