Amen. Thank you, Francesca. Let's give Francesca a hand.。
I loved the analogy of, you know, fasting and instead of fast food,。
actually having a quality meal with God and spending time with God.。
And that's really what we believe God is calling us into inter-season.。
You know, it's the commune with Him and to experience Him and just to sit with Him, hear from Him.。
And so, yeah, that was great. Of course, it made me hungry, but that's okay.。
Well, today we're continuing in our sermon series, Fresh Encounters.。
And so, as we were preparing for this, for 2024, as a church family,。
one of the themes that came up was that need for intimacy,。
that God wants to do something new, something fresh in our relationship with Him.。
And so, we designed a sermon series around the fasting.。
And there is for every Sunday, we have a topic, a spiritual practice that can help us draw close to God,。
that can help us encounter Him in fresh ways.。
And so, I want to share with you what we have planned.。
So, we've already talked about fasting last week.。
Today, we're going to look at prayer, then next week, personal worship,。
then there'll be confession and repentance and God's Word,。
and how God uses all those five things to draw us near to Him.。
Now, I also want to say for those of you who perhaps have been a Christian for a while,。
sometimes you're like, "Oh, I know all this. I know how to read God's Word.。
I know how to pray." And you might say those things.。
But there is a sense that we want to challenge each other to break out of our ruts and out of our routines.。
Because it's easy to have this routine and do the same thing.。
But Jesus wants to meet us in new ways. He wants to meet us in fresh ways.。
And so, even though we might be familiar with some of these things or some of these practices,。
Jesus wants to do something new and something fresh.。
So, let's ask Him for that, and let's keep challenging each other as we're going through this.。
You know, we want to encounter Him in fresh ways.。
Now, today, we're looking at the spiritual practice of prayer.。
And there have been, for myself, there's been powerful seasons of prayer,。
where prayer flows for me easily.。
And there is just a sense of communing with God and God's presence and God speaking to me,。
and me having clarity on what He's saying and having clarity about His love.。
And, you know, that's awesome.。
But if I'm honest, there's also a lot of seasons, and they do come and go.。
It's not a, you know, you settle this one time, and then you're good,。
and you just have easy prayer and easy communion with God.。
There's been a lot of seasons for me where it's been difficult to pray.。
Maybe something difficult was going on in my life, and I felt like I was done with words.。
I already had told God everything.。
You know, I didn't know what else to say.。
Can be many different reasons.。
For whatever reason, prayer did not flow easily.。
So I don't know where you are on this topic.。
Maybe your prayer life right now is alive and is amazing.。
I mean, Francesca was sharing that she's experiencing a deeper communion with God。
in this fasting season.。
That is awesome.。
Praise God.。
But maybe there's actually, right now, you're experiencing challenges,。
and it's hard for you to just to commune with Jesus, to hear from Him, to experience Him.。
Now, on a topic like today, it's, of course, in some way, I'm going to encourage you to pray more.。
But if that's the only thing that I'm doing, you already know that.。
So what I want to do today is actually take a little bit of a different angle.。
I want to look with you at how Jesus encourages His disciples to pray,。
how He encourages them to come to the Father.。
And my prayer is that you're encouraged and inspired and moved by the Holy Spirit。
because of what Jesus is saying to draw closer to Him.。
And to commune with Him more in prayer.。
Now, before we move further, I actually want to also spend a little bit of time defining what prayer is.。
So let's look at a definition.。
If you're familiar with Pete Gregg, he is the founder of 24/7 Prayer.。
If you've ever done the prayer course, that's the guy who came up with that.。
And he defines prayer the following way.。
He says this, "Prayer is a living conversation with a loving God,。
which means that we must listen as well as talk."。
So prayer, when we spend time with God in prayer, we're not just talking.。
Prayer is not just asking, even though that is an important part of prayer.。
But it's sitting with God quietly.。
It's hearing from Him.。
It's talking to Him about what's going on.。
It's doing that throughout the day.。
We can do that when we're busy, when we're at work.。
We can pray silently in our hearts.。
But then it's also important to carve out that extra time where we can have this privacy to really listen.。
And so prayer is a huge topic.。
And today I'm not going to be able to cover everything or say everything on that.。
But what I want to do with you is explore how does Jesus encourage His disciples to pray,。
and how might He encourage us through that as well.。
So we're in the Gospel of Matthew.。
We're one of the most famous sections of Scripture, which is known as the Sermon on the Mount.。
And we're in chapter 7, and starting in verse 7, it says this,。
"Ask, and it will be given to you.。
Seek, and you will find.。
Knock, and the door will be opened to you.。
For everyone who asks receives.。
The one who seeks finds.。
And the one who knocks, the door will be opened.。
Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?。
Or if he asks for fish, will give him a snake?。
If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,。
how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him?"。
So first, Jesus here, He encourages us to pray by reminding us of the power of prayer.。
And in verse 7 and 8, He repeats twice, "Ask, seek, knock."。
He's emphasizing that.。
Our prayers really make a difference.。
They really matter.。
God loves when His people come to Him and ask.。
He loves responding to our prayers and working through them.。
He loves it.。
And we have a tendency to underestimate that.。
I mean, otherwise, why does Jesus need to encourage the disciples to ask, to seek, to knock?。
And if we wouldn't underestimate it, we would actually ask more, knock more, seek more.。
Now, for us during the church plan process, we had to ask, because there was no way this could happen.。
And God provided in incredible ways.。
For me, one of the most amazing, and I know I've shared this several times,。
but we were still in one tribe.。
We were figuring out what to do.。
We had a barbecue and a one-off Sunday service, and we just really felt God speaking to us。
and showing us that it was time to move to Yuen Long.。
It was time to go to EIS, even though this building was not ready.。
It was not part of our plan, but God spoke, and so we went.。
And it was so good.。
We needed a time.。
It was amazing.。
Then we had the venue here.。
Sometimes you wait until it's quite late to ask.。
So we suddenly hit a dead end here, where we were not able to move forward with this place.。
You know, I wrote that speech that I was going to present to the church,。
and the implications, oh my gosh, they were weighing on us.。
I go, it's had serious financial implications.。
So we're asking God for a provision.。
And then he provided a way forward, even though we were told before。
that there was no way we could move forward.。
God provided.。
And so this has been part of our journey.。
Right now in this fasting season, we're asking God personally.。
We're asking the Holy Spirit about what he wants to do in our lives.。
You know, is there a pattern of sin that needs to be broken?。
Do we need some guidance?。
Is there a decision that we need to make?。
We're coming before God and praying, asking, Lord, speak to us.。
We want to hear from you.。
We need you to work in our lives.。
Then, but we're not just asking for ourselves.。
I think this is really important.。
We're also asking for the community.。
That's why we're fasting corporately, because we want to see the kingdom of God。
break into here and now.。
Our heart's prayer is your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.。
We want to see God's kingdom manifested in you long in the present.。
Earlier when we were worshipping, I'm like going to sing, you know, there's power in the name of Jesus.。
You know, Jesus in the streets, I'm getting the lyrics wrong, it's okay.。
But I was like, that's what we're praying for.。
We're praying for Jesus.。
His name is life.。
We're praying for people's lives to be turned around, for those who don't know that their。
love, that their valuable, that their worth.。
I was prayer walking out there by the schools, and I just thought, I'm going to pray for。
people, and I just felt led to pray for the students who don't know that they are loved,。
that they are valuable, that they are worthy.。
And the Holy Spirit wants to mobilize us and send us out and encourage and speak these。
truths and love people.。
And so we're crying out, we're asking your kingdom come, your will be done.。
And earth as it is in heaven, that's our hearts cry.。
We're asking God for that.。
We're knocking, we're seeking.。
We're saying not by our own strength, not by our own wisdom, but by your power, by your。
spirit.。
So this is part of what we're doing because we know we cannot do it.。
We cannot do it.。
So Jesus's encouragement to ask, seek, and knock highlights our temptation not to ask,。
not to seek, not to knock, and to rely on our own strength and our own resources.。
And we do that all the time.。
I do it all the time.。
I felt as I was preparing this semester, I felt really challenged in that.。
A problem, you know, if something comes up, we go into action mode.。
I like to tackle things.。
I'm proactive and I try to resolve it.。
And then it doesn't work and I try harder and then I try harder.。
And then finally I realized, oh, I could, maybe I should pray.。
Anyone do this?。
Yeah?。
Okay, I'm not the only one.。
Good.。
So then I pray and it's amazing how many times God provides.。
It's amazing.。
I, quite a while ago, I lost a watch that my father gave me for my 18th birthday.。
And it was somewhere in my apartment.。
So I was searching for my watch.。
And what makes us more special was that he actually had passed away just a little bit。
less than a year prior.。
And so this had, it was like a way I'm trying to remember my dad.。
And I'm searching like a madman in my house.。
And I'm searching in places where it doesn't even make sense that the watch could possibly。
be there.。
I mean, I literally looked at every inch of my house and I could not find it.。
And I was freaked out because this was so special to me.。
And then I prayed and asked Jesus, can you help me find my dad's watch?。
And as I was praying, I remembered that in one of my drawers, there was a crack that。
was quite wide.。
And so I thought, well, maybe it slipped out there.。
So I took the drawer out and there was my father's watch.。
And I know this was the Holy Spirit's guidance.。
I would, why would I think of a crack in my drawer?。
You know?。
And so God, when we ask, when we seek, he loves providing.。
He loves providing.。
But truth be told, our prayers don't always have that quick of an answer or a resolution。
or a provision.。
More times than not, but more times than not, I've experienced God provide.。
This, this watch, it was so precious to me.。
And it was not too small of a thing for God to care about.。
He cares about your details, your personal details in your life.。
And so we can ask him, we can ask.。
I'm also reminded of Archbishop William Temple.。
He said this, when I pray, coincidences happen.。
When I stop praying, the coincidences stop happening.。
In other words, when I ask, seek, and knock, I'm not asking for anything.。
Because when I ask, seek, and knock, there's receiving, there's answers.。
When I don't ask, seek, and knock, nothing happens.。
Now, of course, God is good.。
He blesses us in a lot of ways, but there's certain things he only does when his children。
come to him and ask.。
Now, you might think, well, that's, that's great for you.。
That, that's, that's your experience, Tim.。
This is not for me.。
In verse eight, it says this, for everyone who asks, receives.。
This is not just for pastors.。
This is not for especially spiritual people.。
This is not for people who didn't sin last week.。
Everyone who asks, receives.。
God loves you.。
He loves when his children come to him and ask.。
He loves giving you things, good things.。
And I wonder, whoever's here today has been intimidated or hesitant to ask God,。
to ask our Heavenly Father, who here has felt this love?。
Who here has felt disqualified or not addressed when Jesus says that everyone who asks, receives?。
Who here feels right now disqualified or not addressed?。
You're not disqualified.。
Jesus loves you.。
Your Heavenly Father loves you.。
This is for every one of us, not just for some, for every one of us.。
He loves when his children come to him.。
Now, at this point, you might be wondering, is it really true that God answers every request we make?。
And this is based on our experience because we've prayed.。
And it seems like there has been no answer, right?。
Come on, let's, let's be honest.。
While it is true that everyone who asks, receives,。
it is not true that everyone receives exactly what they ask for.。
That's a big difference.。
Sometimes God gives us exactly what we request, you know, in the time when we need it, in that moment.。
Amazing, like with my watch, praise God, praise God.。
And other times he gives us something even better.。
Because we don't even sometimes know how to ask for good things for us.。
He gives us better things.。
But then sometimes we also don't receive what we ask for.。
What we still receive.。
Think of Jesus.。
Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, he prayed that this cup can pass,。
which means he was praying that he didn't have to go through the suffering of the cross.。
He prayed to the Father three times.。
Now, the Heavenly Father didn't answer Jesus's prayer in by removing the suffering.。
But Jesus did receive from his Father.。
He gave him the grace and the strength to go through the cross and the rise from the dead.。
So everyone who asks receives.。
But we need to come.。
We need to ask.。
We need to knock.。
We need to search.。
So Jesus encourages us to ask, knock and seek.。
He encourages us, he encourages the disciples by saying everyone who asks receives.。
And this encouragement is really rooted in God's goodness and who God is.。
That he loves you.。
That he's for you, he's not against you.。
That's why we can come.。
That's why we know he will be good to us because our Father is good.。
That's how Jesus is encouraging us.。
Because God is good.。
He is faithful.。
And he loves you.。
But let's continue looking at our passage.。
In verse 9, starting verse 9 says this, "Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?。
Or if he asks for fish, will give him a snake?。
If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,。
how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him?"。
So Jesus draws on this everyday experience that we have.。
And you can even have this experience here because there's lots of children here。
that come to their parents and they ask for things.。
Parents love giving good things to their children.。
And it says, "Though while we are evil," this is talking about our sinfulness, our brokenness of all humanity.。
You know, we're selfish, there's just things in our hearts.。
And even as parents, we're broken parents.。
But despite of that, we still give good things to our children.。
And then Jesus says, "How much more?"。
Because God is perfect, our Heavenly Father is perfect.。
How much more will he give you good things to those who ask?。
How much more?。
Now I was thinking of, if when I was a child, if I would have had the option。
with my parent in a superstore, not super, it might have been a superstore, a supermarket,。
and I could have picked what's for dinner.。
Chances are, I would have picked like 10 Snickers or something that's not good for me.。
Or whatever I was in the mood for at the time.。
Now good parents, maybe they let you have one of those candy bars,。
but then there's a point where they're going to say no.。
But they give good things.。
You know, our Father in heaven, we come to him,。
he has the big picture.。
We don't have the big picture of our lives in mind.。
We don't.。
But God knows everything.。
And so when we come to him and ask, we have the promise that he will give us good things.。
The things that are in line with his will, align with his purpose.。
And one of the things that I love right now is that we're praying for our community.。
God loves that because we're praying for good things.。
We're praying for God to just pour out his love, to pour his provision on the people around us.。
God loves answering those prayers.。
God loves also answering our prayers when we as children come to our heavenly Father.。
Now I want to highlight that Jesus refers to God as your Father in heaven, your Father.。
And since God is our Father, it means that we have been adopted as his children into his family.。
And he's already made us the greatest gift of all,。
which is the gift of salvation.。
He has forgiven us our sins, he has brought us in as his sons, his daughters, his children.。
And if he's already made you the greatest gift, and you come to your Father and you ask him,。
he is for you, he loves you, he's not going to withhold good things from you.。
And Jesus wants his disciples to know this.。
And so he encourages them to come to their loving heavenly Father.。
He loves you, he loves you.。
And so we come as children to our Father in prayer.。
Now one thing, this passage does focus a lot on asking.。
But I really, as I was preparing for this message, I did have a strong sense that some of our fresh。
encounter is really just growing in this father-child relationship for us, of getting to know。
God as our loving, perfect Father.。
I know our human fathers, a lot of times, were not, are not perfect.。
But God is perfect.。
And he wants us to learn to relate to him as a child relates to the Father.。
You don't have to be hesitant when you're a child to come to your dad.。
You can just come and be and ask and spend time and tell your father about the day and what has。
happened.。
Now for me, when I was a young adult, there was a lot of guilt, shame, pain in my life.。
And my, even though I was a Christian, my relationship with God was not one of a child。
with a father, with a loving heavenly Father.。
Felt maybe a little bit more like coming to your business manager, your boss or something.。
I didn't, I didn't feel like I was adequate because I knew, I knew my life.。
It was so much just shame and sin.。
And I felt like I could not come to my heavenly Father.。
I didn't feel like I always had access.。
And then I had this powerful experience where somebody was teaching on who God is and how。
he loves us.。
And then there was a prayer time afterwards.。
And first I was sitting and later on I was on the floor weeping.。
But it's been one of the most healing moments of my life where God revealed himself to me。
as the loving Father.。
And this pain, this shame, this guilt, it started melting away in the presence of God.。
I was communing with my loving dad.。
Now this is revelation.。
This is the Holy Spirit's work revealing God to us in this way.。
But I have a sense that some of us need this revelation.。
God wants to reveal himself as the Father who loves you.。
So Jesus encourages us to come to him, to come to our heavenly Father, to bring anything。
that's going on in our lives to him, pour our hearts to him, to receive his love, his。
care, his goodness, his provision.。
To bring our requests and experience how he meets us.。
So we've seen that Jesus encourages his disciples to ask, not seek.。
We've seen that he encourages us to come like a child, to come to the Father.。
And I wonder how is Jesus encouraging us here today to come to him?。
How is Jesus encouraging us here today for a fresh encounter with him in prayer?。
How is he inviting you to experiencing him a new way?。
What is the rut he might be inviting you to break out of?。
Out of what routine is he calling you to break out?。
Well, perhaps for some of us, this means instead of relying on our own resources and our own。
strengths, and that being our first thing that we do, we get in the action mode, we。
try to resolve things.。
That's my default.。
But actually, I wonder what would happen if we bring more of our daily life in the conversation。
with our heavenly Father?。
What if we just start by bringing those things to God instead of first just trying to resolve。
everything and until we hit a wall and then come to him?。
I really felt Jesus challenged me to flip this around, to not only come when I'm at。
a dead end, but already beforehand be talking to him and asking and seeking and knocking.。
So perhaps that is a fresh way that God is also inviting you to relate to him.。
Or for others of us, God is inviting us to come to him in prayer as a child comes to。
the Father.。
We're children of God, but often relate to God as a business manager who does not have。
time for us, who's too busy, who doesn't want to be bothered.。
You have his attention.。
He has time for you to spare.。
He loves when you come to him.。
He delights in you.。
And when we get to know God as our loving Father, we start to experience wholeness,。
peace, security.。
So how is God inviting you to renew, to refresh your prayer life?。
Now I want to invite the worship team to come up right now.。
And what I want to invite you to do is actually it's something we do quite often at the Vine,。
whether in Monshire here, is we want to pray with each other.。
So whether you pray with somebody you came with, you know, maybe there's somebody close。
to you and you just ask, "Hey, would you be cool that we can pray together?"。
I want to encourage you to pray with each other, to pray for your prayer life, to pray。
you can share how you need prayer and just to minister to each other, just to come to。
our heavenly Father in prayer.。
So we're going to do this for five to seven minutes, and then I'll bring us back together.。
So let's, yeah, let's do that right now.。
So let's turn to each other.。
Let's pray for each other.。
The prayer team will also be up here.。
If you would like somebody to minister to you in prayer, you can come to them.。
We would love to pray with you as well.。

Jesus, through your sacrifice, we have access.。
We have access to the Father anywhere, anytime.。
And so, Lord, I ask that this year。

in us as a community, in our personal lives,。
that you grow us deeper in prayer,。
deeper in communing with you.。
I pray for a new work,。

We can't force that. We can do it.。
It's your work.。
It's the Holy Spirit we ask for you to work in this way.。
I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen.。
