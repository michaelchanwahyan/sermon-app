and welcome to Divine Yuen Long and let me introduce myself. I'm June, I'm one of the。
staff here normally. Well, actually my role is to look after the family and kids ministry。
and I'm honoured today to share my story with you today. So, when I was young, well actually right。
now I don't really celebrate my birthdays because it fall on a festive day and people are already。
having parties and stuff like that. So, I'm happily crashing their birthday, their parties。
and make it my birthday party and just to have fun and you know celebrate together. But one of the。
reasons why that is because obviously it was a festive day and people are already celebrating,。
but another reason is that it might be because of one of the stories that I had when I was young.。
So, when I was young, I'm not a very sociable person. I don't have a lot of friends, I have。
very low social skills and so when I was in third grade, I already don't have a lot of friends. So,。
I decided this year I'm going to have my first ever birthday party. I'm going to invite the many。
numbers of friends that I have at school and my cousins to come to my place and just have a good。
time. They don't know each other because some were from my home, some were from school, you know,。
they were in different parts of my life. But you know, I don't know if they planned it together.。
One by one, they started to cancel on me on the day of the birthday party. So, at that time,。
I was heartbroken. I just sleep it off pretending nothing has happened. But actually, what I was。
feeling was rejection and I didn't know it at that time, but as I grow, I realize that rejection is。
everyone's story. No matter you are a few months old or you are 900 years old, it is something that。
we have to go through every day. Maybe you start your rejection getting rejected when you want to。
go to someone's home and your parents said no. Maybe you were rejected because you want to sleep。
at 10 o'clock tonight and your parents said no. Maybe you were rejected when you proposed to。
someone, maybe for your visa application. There are many opportunities where we would put ourselves。
out there to be vulnerable and what we received was a rejection. Some rejections are easy to let。
go. Sometimes we can just move on with our life easily. But there are emotions that are hard to。
let go. It's not because those are big incidents, there are big things that it's very hard to let。
go. Sometimes they're just tiny things. But when we get rejected, it's not that they are rejecting。
the incident itself. It felt like they are rejecting me. Me as a person and my worth and。
my worth to be at a certain place. The passage that we're looking at today is about the story。
of Jesus being born in Bethlehem. And like the perfect and simplified version of a children's。
nativity play, the details of the Christmas story actually revealed God's heart for us.。
How is that connected to my story of rejection? When the angels and the hosts all celebrate and。
sing together when Jesus was born, how can it connect that to my story of rejection?。
So let's have a look at today's scripture together. It's from Luke chapter 2, verse 1 to 5.。
In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman。
world. That was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria. And everyone。
went to their own town to register. So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to。
Judea to Bethlehem, the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.。
The story begins by setting the time, character, and location. Luke not only describes the birth。
of Jesus, but also connects that with a historical event. The Roman Empire was ruling over Israel,。
and that with one degree, the whole world, meaning the whole Roman Empire, had to pack their bags and。
go and return to where they belonged to. So regardless of their social status or what was。
going on with their life, they all had to go. So Joseph and Mary set off to their journey,。
and the journey described in the passage was not a short one. It would have taken approximately。
three weeks. So because if you look at it in the map, it would be a straight line from Nazareth to。
Bethlehem. But however, they couldn't go through Syria. They have to detour a little somewhere. So。
that actually took around three weeks. And not only that, the danger and the trouble of traveling。
so far was actually really tough for both of them. Well, I got a chance to visit Israel in August,。
and I had experience of hiking, you know, at the outskirt of the desert of Judea, and I actually。
hiked with my life, as if actually my life depended on it as I hike, because it was so hot and so。
and so difficult and so treacherous. I remember as I normally when I hike, I would follow the。
guide very closely, because if I don't, I would get lost. I did not know my way around the world.。
But at that time, when I hike, I let go of the guide. I let go of the whole group. I'm just。
trying to stay alive. I had my water bottle with me. I'm holding it as if I'm holding my baby,。
and I just tried to keep up and try to stay alive. And actually, the hike was easy,。
was hard for young individuals like you and I. But imagine, Mary at that time, she was pregnant,。
and had to travel from one place to another. And of course, there were many debates over whether。
they start the journey in summer or autumn or winter. And probably most of the time,。
most of the debate, they were leaning towards winter. So they don't have to deal with the。
scorching heat or the temperature. But what they had to deal with was the extreme temperature。
differences, what they have to deal with was the rocks and the burglars that were hiding,。
and they were trying to overtake or try to rob the passerbys. And there were lots of dangers along。
the way. In addition to their personal pressures, Mary had to carry the burden of being an unwed。
woman from the very beginning. Throughout those nine months, she likely to face a lot of gossips。
and accusations. They faced disbelief and judgment and rejection from those who doubt the story.。
The accumulated stress during those months must have been overwhelming. They might have。
originally hoped for a quiet and private birth, but their plan didn't go expected. In the midst。
of all these pressures, they had to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem, and with Mary physically。
pregnant and unable to hide it. Can you imagine what went through Mary's head?。
Maybe she would have thought, "God, didn't you told me the plan? Didn't you get me, you know,。
the Holy Spirit pregnant me with a baby? Isn't it your dream? Give me the dream and vision for me to。
carry it for you? Didn't you also set it to your husband that not to be afraid? How can your dream。
and your vision coming down like this, into this mess like this? Aren't you the wonderful God who。
could help me and prepare everything for me that you gave me this vision, and now everything seems。
to be a mess? How could this be?" I don't know if you resonate with what Mary had experienced.。
Maybe God has given you a dream or a vision or something to work toward, but in the middle of it,。
it gets so messy that you doubt if it's ever going to happen and doubt if God ever had spoken to you。
like that. But one of the things that this mess was actually planned by God. We in our limitation。
can only see so far, but God with His unlimited, unlimited resource, unlimited vision can see past。
our mess. This mess was intended so that we could experience Him. It is not that the mess was。
something out of God's control. It is a mess that was planned so that we could experience God.。
So let's keep on looking at the next passage from Luke chapter 2, 6 to 7.。
"And while they were there, a time came for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn。
and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him on a manger, because there was no place for them。
to be in the inn, because there was no place for them in the inn." Having no place is a remarkable。
statement. Why was there no place? Did Joseph not book a room in advance? Was there no hotel?。
Did he try Airbnb? He should. It's quite useful. However, as we mentioned earlier, Joseph and Mary。
was not going on a trip. They were not traveling. They had to go back to where David, where。
Josh Joseph came from, that going back to where he came from. And so it would probably be going。
back to his family, to his relatives, to his uncle and aunt, probably someone that he know.。
And so when they travel back to Bethlehem, they will not go for an inn. They would not go for。
someone they don't know. They would have expected to go back to their family. They would have。
expected their family to open up their arms, to embrace them completely, especially for Mary,。
that she has been pregnant and is about to give birth. She would have anticipated a place where。
the family would welcome her in and just give her a place to stay and to give birth in a safe。
environment. However, as Joseph going to door to door, asking for a room, and they say no,。
it was not because of the only innkeeper that was heartless. It was actually the community。
of where Joseph was from. And to add on to that, they did not just reject two healthy individuals.。
They were rejecting a woman who was about to give birth. If there are mothers and fathers in the。
room, if you've experienced the hectic and the nervousness of your spouse giving birth,。
it would be hard to imagine that when Joseph have to take Mary door to door and all the answers。
was a no. No, you cannot stay here. No, even if giving birth is a life and death event,。
we will not make room for you. That you have to give birth where animals eat.。
The first Christmas is not of a picture perfect one. It was one about rejection.。
The savior of the world was not welcomed at the beginning. No one was willing to make room for。
Mary to give birth to Jesus. And his rejection didn't stop there. Time and time again, people。
rejected him. The Jews cast stones at him. People at his hometown tried to throw him off the。
cliff. The religious leaders criticized him because he hung out with the wrong people. He hung。
out with sinners and with people of the margins. His own disciples who followed him, who saw all。
his great acts, who had been loved by Jesus, one self-sold him out and the other refused to。
acknowledge him, to know him. His friends, his families, and religious leaders all rejected him.。
Even ourselves, before we started to accept Jesus, we ourselves have rejected him.。
We did not regard him as our savior. We try to fix our lives with our own ways, hurting others。
and ourselves along the way. Even now, when we have become Christians, we will fall into。
rejecting him when we kept him at bay, hiding from him, not acknowledging his sovereignty over us.。
Jesus fully understands the pain of being rejected, the hurt of not being recognized or heard,。
the isolation, the shame of not being included. He fully understands it, and that's why I know。
that he can fully understand me. I'm an only child, and from a young age, I learned my social。
skills through observation. But instead of learning how to make friends, my mind started。
to collect evidence of why people wouldn't want to be friends with me. My parents at that time。
were busy with work, and communication or affirmation was not their priority. And so,。
all these have created a wall between me and people. I could think of a million ways or a。
million thoughts about me, why people wouldn't hang out with me or give me that opportunity.。
In my head, there were reasons why I'm not loved. In order not to be rejected,。
I reject other people. I start to collect evidence of why people wouldn't want to include me. So,。
before I go for that position, or I try to reach out to those people, or I try to。
join in that activity, I would think of reasons why I shouldn't do that, and I say, "Jun,。
you cannot do that. You are not accepted. You will not be loved. Let's stay where you are."。
And so, with all these experiences and rejections, a rejection at myself and a rejection at other。
people, I put that with my experience with my God. I project what I've experienced to how God。
would have loved me as well. I know that God loves everyone unconditionally, but then, but then.。
I know that God will love me, but how could He love me if I have all these faults? I know God。
would love me, but He would love the good part of me. Let me fix my fault first. Let me fix my。
failures first. He would love this good part of me, and the parts that I have rejected myself,。
I'm just going to hide. I'm just going to stay where I am. And so, for the longest time, I do。
not, I did not experience the love of God because of how I've experienced my love in this world.。
I find that as I've rejected myself, I have rejected others' love for me and God's love for me.。
And because of rejection, I've isolated myself and carried the burden of always living on edge。
in the fear of more rejection. It felt like I'm walking on a tightrope. I'm longing to reach to。
the other side, to make friends, to be connected, to have that opportunity. But I'm also carrying。
this heavy burden of the fear of being rejected, of the fear that actually what I rejected myself。
is going to be used against me. And I've walked on this tightrope for the longest time.。
But Jesus understood all of that.。
Jesus understood the fear and burden caused by rejection because He has been rejected.。
He understands my defense mechanism because He had lived in this world,。
and He understands my limitation as a human. Jesus showed me through the story of His messy。
birth that He is not looking for a grand entrance to get all the glory and all the love from people.。
He is willing to be born in a smelly, disease-ridden place,。
showing me that He is willing to accept me no matter how dark and rotten I feel I am.。
I've learned that the first step to be healed from the wounds of rejection is acceptance.。
I have to accept that I am fully loved by God. To accept that with my flaws and all,。
I am worthy of love. And it is a decision I have to make before I feel anything. It's not that,。
"Oh, I feel the love of Jesus so I know that I'm fully accepted." If that is the case,。
then I will be going around collecting evidence. "Oh, today I received this so Jesus loves me,。
but today I don't have that, so Jesus doesn't love me." And I will be comparing,。
and I'll be collecting evidence. I will never be filled because I'm looking at this realm,。
and I try to find that if I'm still worth it or not. So in order to be fully accepted,。
I need to make a decision to go, "Hey, I decided that no matter what happens,。
no matter what I see, I accept that Jesus loves me unconditionally. He loves me as a person.。
He loves who I am, the person that He has made. He knows that I am worth it."。
And so that is the first step for me to know that I am accepted.。
We can sing the songs of boundless love a million times, and it would only carry meaning if we could。
accept that the deep, the depth, and the width of His love on each and every one of us. There is no。
flaws and no brokenness and no imperfections that can separate His love for you and for me.。
Every time a sneaky, intrusive thought would come in to tell you that there are reasons for you not。
to be loved, there are reasons for you not to be accepted, but you've got to make a decision。
and let the Holy Spirit to lead you, to guide you to say, "But this is not true.。
This is not what the Bible says. This is not what God's love looks like."。
And so with that thought, I began the journey of my restoration。
because I'm accepted in Christ, fully accepted. I have the courage to show my authentic self to。
people around me. I allow them to see my flaws, my mistakes, and my imperfections,。
knowing that since the Most High has accepted me, I can have no fear.。
Even though they can still reject me, I am always fully known and fully loved.。
You are fully known. All your things that you feel you're good at, all the things that you feel。
you're not good at or not enough, you are fully known and fully loved. This love is not。
because of how good you are. It is because of how deep His love for you is.。
So as I open myself to my community, and specifically to community in Christ,。
they show me that this love actually exists in this world. They show me that not because they。
are able to do that in person, but because each and every one of them has received the love of God,。
the grace of God, and they are extending it to the people around them.。
They don't make use of my mistakes as a reason to reject me, but actually they've stayed by me.。
And even though I was about to run away. And I've seen this in this community. I've seen people walk。
the extra mile. I've seen people going out of their comfort zone to make friends. And I've got。
to say, to reach out and make friends or to be known is a very risky thing, because you are putting。
yourself out there being vulnerable. What if people say no when I say hi? What if people just turn。
their shoulders? What if when I try to say, want to join in their lunch, they would reject me?。
But remember, because you're always fully known, you will always be accepted in Christ's community.。
You are also accepted and welcome if you want to stay on my stage. It's okay.。
So, with that, I would love to extend my message to you to tell you that God loves you very much.。
And I would like every one of you to stand up and just to receive the prayer.。
And would the band please come up as well.。
