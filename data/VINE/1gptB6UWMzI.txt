We thank you for this, Jesus.。
We pray this in your sweet, beautiful, majestic,。
powerful, glorious name.。
And the church says, amen.。
Thank you, church.。
Thank you, worship team.。
(audience applauding)。
Man, that is a beautiful song.。
I love that song so much.。
Man.。
Well, good morning.。
If you're joining us online, good morning as well.。
It's good to see everybody back.。
We've enjoyed another week of black rainstorms。
and crazy weather.。
And what's going on?。
Seriously, it's craziness in the weather,。
but I'm glad everybody is here this morning.。
See some old familiar faces, which is good as well, right?。
And so, yeah, really good to see friends。
and family gathered together this Sunday.。
And if you've been walking with us through this summer,。
we've come to the end of our sermon series。
in the book of James.。
And the hope and the prayer is that we've been changed。
and moved and challenged to consider our faith seriously.。
Right, that we've not just been walking through a letter,。
but we've been letting the words through Scripture。
penetrate our hearts.。
It's a reminder that this life that we claim to live,。
that faith that we came to have,。
there is no room in Scripture for nominal Christianity.。
There's no room for saying, I am a Christian。
and coming here on Sunday and worshiping。
with our hands up, all that kind of stuff,。
without actually living it out.。
Because if we do that, it's just noise.。
It's just a distraction.。
It's almost craziness, right?。
There's a lot better places you could spend on a Sunday。
than coming here to this church, if you're not about that.。
But James lets us know, right, that real and pure religion,。
that following Christ must make a difference。
in the way we live our lives.。
It has to transform everything that we do.。
It's a transformative kind of faith。
that Jesus calls us to have.。
It's an active kind of faith, right,。
that moves us into deeds and actions and not just words.。
It's a countercultural kind of faith。
where we're not friends with the world,。
but we are standing in our friendship with the Lord.。
Otherwise, like I said, all this is just noise.。
Actually, I got some really cool feedback lately.。
One of our teenagers, as he's been walking。
through the book of James, he's been listening,。
he's been reading the book of James,。
I hope by himself as well, he noticed.。
So in response to what he felt like God's。
speaking to his heart, he said he was walking。
down the road one day and he saw someone in need。
and so he stopped to give some money。
to this person that was in need.。
And as a result, the person behind him。
saw what he was doing and they too stopped。
and gave a little bit of money.。
And the person in front of him turned around。
and saw what he was doing and also gave。
that person a little bit of money.。
Right, just a small act of kindness, right,。
set off a chain reaction in the people around him.。
You see what difference it makes when we actually。
put some actions behind this faith that we claim to have.。
It's amazing, it's beautiful.。
But there's one more reason why I felt。
or we felt like it was important for us。
to go through this book of James and embrace its challenges.。
And that is because there is an urgency to our faith.。
You see, if you read through the entire letter of James。
in one sitting, which I highly recommend you do,。
right, you'll notice that throughout the letter。
there is a pressing, there's a desperation。
to remind everyone that time is short.。
Right, that Jesus is returning soon just as he promised.。
Right, which is why James is strong in his tone, right.。
We've held no punches back throughout this series.。
He is strong in his tone, it's challenging,。
but yet there's a deep and tender pastoral heart。
for the hearers of this letter.。
And the urgency and the reminder that we cannot wait。
to act upon this.。
Our faith in Jesus must start making an impact right now.。
So once again, read with me as we come to the closing words。
of this letter, yes, it's gonna continue to be challenging,。
but at the same time, I hope you know that it's filled。
by love and the passion and the recognition。
that there is no time to waste,。
that our time for our faith to make an impact。
is indeed right now.。
James chapter five, chapter first one.。
Now, now listen, now listen, you rich people,。
weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you.。
Your wealth has rotted, moths have eaten your clothes,。
your gold and silver are corroded.。
The corrosion will testify against you。
and eat your flesh like fire.。
You have hoarded wealth in the last days.。
Look, the wages you failed to pay the workers。
who mowed your fields are crying out against you.。
The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears。
of the Lord Almighty.。
You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.。
You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.。
You have condemned and murdered the innocent one。
who was not opposing you.。
Told you it was not easy.。
Have you guys ever heard the saying,。
it's a bit funny but I've heard it around,。
money doesn't solve all your problems。
but I sure wouldn't mind crying in a laberghini, right?。
So, I've never been, if you have a laberghini out there,。
okay, good for you, it'll be fun。
to ride around in one sometime.。
But there is a sense of irony in that saying, right?。
Because we don't usually associate rich people。
with things like weeping and wailing and misery, right?。
Because we feel like they have resources,。
they have everything they need, so why are you sad?。
But when we look throughout scripture,。
throughout the Bible, there is a consistent warning,。
maybe one of the most consistent warnings,。
which goes something along the lines of,。
be careful of how much you focus on money.。
Because God knows it's so easy for our heart。
and our desires to be drawn to money.。
And how quickly the love of money has to rob our ability。
of having affections for the Lord and the people around us.。
And once our distraction to money becomes,。
once money becomes an idol, the risk there。
is that we start to do all kinds of unjust。
and blasphemous acts to the Lord and to each other.。
This is what we talked about in James chapter two.。
When those who have, those who have the resources。
refuse to pay any kind of attention to those who are in need。
instead of just a good, pat you on the back,。
okay, see you later, you go off on your way,。
but I have the resources, I'm not gonna help you.。
The love of money is truly the root。
of all kinds of evil, scripture tells us.。
So why then are the rich suddenly weeping and wailing?。
Right, it's because they're suddenly seeing。
their riches disappear before their very eyes.。
Your wealth has rotted, James says.。
Moths have eaten your clothes.。
Gold and silver are being corroded.。
The corrosion will testify you。
and eat your flesh like fire.。
You have hoarded wealth in the last days.。
You see, the foolish thing about dedicating ourselves。
to material wealth is because material wealth will not last.。
In the context of James, wealth was often tied。
to the abundance of produce from farming, right?。
But what happens when you hoard food?。
We've done this before, right?。
You go to the supermarket, ooh, avocados are on sale, right?。
You get like 15 of them and they just sit。
below your microwave and just wilt and die。
before you have a chance to eat them, right?。
When you hoard food, it starts to stink and rot。
and it becomes useless.。
The clothes too, right?。
We know when Hong Kong winter is coming,。
November 5th seems to be the magic date。
when everybody busts out those winter coats, right?。
An entire bus and empty out all the streets,。
suddenly starts smelling like mothballs, okay?。
Because they've been in storage, okay?。
So mothball becomes the scent of the month, okay?。
But even your clothes, right?。
No matter how fine they are, no matter what brand they are,。
one day your clothes are gonna become worthless.。
The moth will eat them, those little silver bugs。
that we get in Hong Kong will chew through them.。
They will become worthless.。
James is saying even gold and silver,。
two metals that are associated with being incorrodible,。
always holding their value, right?。
Even one day, gold and silver are gonna become worthless.。
They will corrode and disappear.。
And as we look towards the last days,。
we have to keep this in mind.。
And make no mistake, church,。
this is, these are the last days that we're living in.。
Ever since Jesus died and resurrected。
and ascended to heaven, He assured us,。
His promise to us that one day I am going to return.。
And when He returns, yes, it's coming back to love。
and to restore and to redeem,。
to defeat the enemy once and for all, amen?。
To make all things new,。
to judge, to put an end to all injustice.。
He's coming, scripture tells us,。
to judge the living and the dead。
and to gather those who are faithful to Him。
and welcome them into His kingdom.。
Now, when we talk about this topic, though,。
it sounds like one of those things。
that's always threatened, but it's never going to happen.。
Right, you know like, if you go to the big department stores。
like Wing On, right, there's always,。
they're always doing a final promotional sale, right?。
So you go and buy something, it's like,。
[speaking in foreign language]。
Right, and stuff, you know?。
And then next week you go,。
and then it's suddenly like a super big final sale, okay?。
So you think, okay, this is my last chance, okay?。
And then you go a few weeks later,。
it's the last super big, super promotional sale, right?。
And so, it just keeps going on and on and on.。
It's just a marketing tactic, right?。
It never actually ends, right?。
And you realize it's just a big scam.。
They just want you to buy stuff.。
But church, this is not the case.。
This is not what we're talking about here, right?。
The return of Jesus is not a scam, right?。
It's not some made up story aimed to keep us on our toes.。
Jesus said it Himself, "Keep watch.。
"You do not know on what day or hour even。
"the Lord will come."。
And just as Pastor Carlos said last week,。
God's economy is not our economy.。
God's timing is not our timing.。
And so, therefore, we are called to live。
as if Jesus will really return at any moment.。
And in these last days before Jesus comes back,。
in the time where Jesus has already begun the work。
of inaugurating His kingdom here on earth,。
to making things new, to redeeming His creation,。
hoarding wealth is the exact opposite。
of what He has called us to do with our resources.。
When Jesus came back, didn't He flip。
this entire approach on its head?。
Instead, didn't He say, "Blessed are the poor,。
"for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."。
Didn't Jesus teach us, as hard as it is for us to hear,。
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle。
than it is for someone who is rich。
to enter the kingdom of God?。
Wasn't Jesus' words to the rich young ruler,。
"If you want to be perfect, go, sell all your possessions,。
"give it to the poor, you will have treasure in heaven,。
"and then come follow me."。
So hoarding wealth doesn't make sense,。
but there's something even worse going on here.。
It's not just that the rich have hoarded all this wealth.。
The bigger problem is they have done it。
on the backs, on the expense of other people.。
First Paul says this, "Look, the wages you have failed。
"to pay the workers who mowed your fields。
"are crying out against you.。
"The cries of harvesters have reached。
"the ears of the Lord Almighty.。
"You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.。
"You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.。
"You have condemned and murdered the innocent one。
"who was not opposing you."。
All this wealth that these people have。
has been created through dishonest and unjust practices.。
Right, and the law, the Levitical law。
had rules addressing this kind of behavior.。
Deuteronomy 24 says this, "Pay them their wages,。
"pay the workers their wages, each day before sunset,。
"because they are poor and they're counting on it.。
"Otherwise, they may cry to the Lord against you,。
"and you will be guilty of sin."。
So James is concerned about the attitude。
and the fact that the rich are not using their resources。
to help others just as the Lord has instructed us to do.。
But rather, they would live selfishly,。
in luxury, in self-indulgence.。
And James is condemning the fact that we are hoarding wealth。
where we should use it to help those who are in need.。
And like I said just now, this is one of the dangers.。
When we make money and resources and idol,。
the danger is we dehumanize image bearers of God,。
of God's people and His children.。
And while we're enjoying luxury and self-indulgence,。
people aren't even being given what they are due.。
And our eyes and ears become so dull。
that we're blinded and muted for seeing and hearing。
those who are crying out.。
But God sees it all.。
Now we enjoy this thinking, we're set,。
things are good for me, I don't have a worry in the world.。
And when we live like this, James says,。
it's like we're fattening ourselves just to be slaughtered.。
It's almost like a comical picture.。
We are sacrificing ourselves to this worldly God。
of luxury and comfort.。
We're like the fattened calf, we're like Wagyu beef.。
You know how Wagyu beef, they feed the cows,。
all kinds of stuff, fatten it up.。
The end result of that cow,。
while he's enjoying all that stuff,。
right, oh, this is great, you know, I'm being massaged,。
I'm being fed all this good food.。
In the end, what's the end of that cow?。
To be slaughtered, right?。
And this is exactly what we're doing, James says,。
when we just indulge in ourselves。
and ignore the cries of those around us.。
The fate that awaits is slaughter.。
It's death.。
Church, if we make our goal in life,。
if what we want to do with our time in this world。
is just enjoy as many luxuries as possible,。
whilst at the same time ignoring the cries。
of those who are in need,。
Scripture likens it to murdering innocent people.。
And we are condemning ourselves.。
And we sit around thinking, you know, there's time for that.。
I'm gonna get to that one day, right?。
Right now, you know, I'm here for a good time,。
not for a long time, so I'm just gonna focus on me。
and do everything what I want to do。
when Jesus could literally return at any moment.。
Brothers and sisters, part of our pure faith。
means that we cannot live like this.。
We cannot live like we don't want that day to come。
because we've made life so comfortable for ourselves.。
And in living like the Scripture says,。
we are greedy, we are undressed, we are ungodly,。
and it will catch up with us.。
We are condemning ourselves.。
We're preparing our flesh to be eaten like fire.。
But instead, as followers of Jesus,。
we should be hastening the day.。
We should be crying out to the Lord。
to return to make things right.。
We should be crying out for His justice,。
praying for the restoration of creation,。
joining in in God's work in restoring and repairing。
and redeeming humans to Himself.。
We look forward to the day when sin is no more,。
which means we are tirelessly trying to ensure。
that we are preparing the way for Jesus' arrival.。
We are preaching the Gospel.。
We are reaching out to those in need.。
We are speaking out to those who are facing injustice.。
This is the mission we have at hand.。
And we cannot sit idly by,。
especially when there are people out there。
being oppressed and suffering from injustice.。
God's economy is not our economy.。
Jesus came to turn the entire system upside down.。
Karl Barth says it this way.。
Instead of striving for higher position,。
more power and more influence,。
Jesus moves from the heights to the depths,。
from victory to defeat, from riches to poverty,。
from triumphs to suffering, from life to death.。
Jesus came to say, "Blessed are the poor."。
And His ears are always tuned to hear the voices。
of those crying out for justice.。
So we're reminded today, church,。
that we're here on God's time.。
Just because it hasn't happened yet,。
don't think that it's not going to.。
And Jesus is returning.。
James reminds us of that.。
And so to end this letter,。
he gives us some instructions on how he wants us to live.。
Taking care of the poor, the widow and the orphans,。
doing God's work of justice.。
But there's two more things he wants us to embrace。
as we look into these last days.。
The two things are this, patience and prayer.。
Patience and prayer.。
Let's look at patience for a minute.。
Firstly, James calls us to be patient in the Lord.。
Now again, in our modern day lives,。
it's almost like the entire idea of patience。
is trying to be erased from our vocabulary.。
We don't like waiting for stuff.。
Everything is marketed towards the idea。
that the faster, the more convenient it is,。
the better for us, right?。
[speaking in foreign language]。
Right, that's a Hong Kong motto.。
Everything is on demand.。
You can order anything you want at any time。
with the touch of a button.。
You can have food, clothes, anything you want delivered。
right to your doorstep almost immediately.。
Now, I'll be a hypocrite to say。
I don't enjoy the conveniences of modern life.。
It's great sometimes to have those things available to us.。
But again, the danger is that this way of living。
robs us and dulls us of how God wants us to respond。
to how he wants us to live.。
And we forget the value in waiting。
and having patience in the Lord.。
Waiting on the Lord will always lead。
to something of great value.。
Every time we wait on the Lord, it's not time wasted.。
It's not doing nothing, but it's trusting。
that God is doing something。
and that one day it's going to bear fruit, right?。
This is why patience is part of the fruit of the Spirit。
that scripture encourages us to grow in.。
That's why patience is a key component of love.。
And when we are patiently waiting on our Lord,。
it's a sign of the hope and the faith that we have in Jesus.。
James uses a illustration from agriculture。
to highlight this to us.。
He says this, "See how the farmer waits for the land。
"to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting。
"for the autumn and spring rains.。
"You too, be patient and stand firm。
"because the Lord's coming is near."。
Again, we go to our wet markets, we go to Welcome,。
we go to Park and Shop, wherever we like to do our shopping,。
right, and we see the rows and rows of fruits。
and vegetables, the meat, everything is right there。
ready for us just to take to the counter,。
check out, and take home.。
But next time we go, be mindful.。
The way that produce got there wasn't just magic, right?。
It wasn't just someone just made them appear.。
It's gone through the time of growing, of tilling,。
there was a farmer or a process, right,。
that all that stuff had to go through。
in order for it to end up on our supermarket shelves.。
And there was a person who planted seed and waited,。
and it seemed like nothing was happening。
until that plant begins to break through the soil.。
And this is the same for us.。
Whilst we're waiting, while God is calling us。
to be patient, we're like a farmer.。
We're hard at work, planting seeds, tilling the ground,。
knowing that God is the one who's gonna do the growing,。
and that in due time, we will reap a harvest。
to collect in God's name.。
So we are patient in the Lord.。
But James also tells us this.。
As we do that, we need to be patient with each other.。
Don't grumble against one another, he says,。
brothers and sisters, or you will be judged.。
The judge is standing at the door.。
Another danger we face as a community。
as we wait for God to return。
is that we start to get impatient.。
And when we get impatient, it's easy to start complaining。
and grumbling and attacking each other.。
Remember what Andrew said a couple of weeks ago。
when we need to, the fact that we need to watch our tongues?。
When we get impatient and grumble,。
we tend then to speak words that are unkind, right?。
Words of death rather than words of life.。
And in these last days, this is what Jesus。
is looking after for, he's especially concerned。
about his people and his church.。
But when we grumble against each other,。
when we fight and we quarrel,。
we cannot be the unified body of Christ。
that he has called us to be.。
We cannot be the hands and feet that he has called us to be.。
When we're busy attacking each other,。
how can we be that voice that speaks out。
for the innocent and those who are suffering injustice?。
When we're so caught up with the splinter。
in each other's eyes, how can we see the evil。
that is happening around us?。
This is why James reminds us, right?。
Don't think just because we're not like those rich oppressors。
that he was talking about at the beginning,。
that God isn't coming to judge us either.。
We should be speaking and acting as if Jesus。
was right at the gates, right at the door.。
Maybe even imagining him putting his ear against the door,。
seeing what's happening inside.。
Any time to open the door, and when he does enter,。
how is he gonna find his church?。
How is he gonna find his people?。
Fighting and grumbling or steadfastly and patiently。
doing the work that he has called us to do.。
And finally, James calls us to also be patient in suffering。
because the call to patience here isn't the kind of patience。
just enough just to wait for a few extra minutes。
for a coffee to be made.。
The patience that God is looking for。
is the steadfast kind of patience。
that even when things aren't going our way,。
we hold on to his promises.。
Even in the toughest of situations.。
And to make his point, James asks us to consider the prophets。
consider the prophets and the things they had to go through.。
Now I both love and I'm terrified by the fact。
that James tells us that we need to be patient in suffering。
and then he turns us to the prophets.。
And even though he doesn't mention any prophet。
in particular by name, if you read through the Old Testament。
and the things the prophets had to go through, right?。
They had to suffer through all kinds of stuff in God's name.。
And in fact, it was often God himself。
who calls his prophets into seasons。
of perseverance and suffering.。
Look at Jeremiah for a second.。
Jeremiah was a man of God, but this man of God。
endured constant persecution, ridicule, and death threats。
all through his ministry.。
Everybody mocked him.。
Everyone was trying to convince him to shut up,。
just denounce God, stop talking about it.。
But even when he himself tried to shut up,。
he said this, these were his words.。
His word in my heart is like a fire,。
a fire shut up in my bones.。
I'm weary of holding it in.。
Indeed, I cannot.。
Right, this quote sounds cool and we like it, you know.。
But you know, this was Jeremiah speaking。
out of a place of desperation.。
This was Jeremiah saying,。
"Yeah, I'd rather be doing anything else."。
You know the amount of stuff I've been through。
as I speak God's name.。
I would rather be doing anything else。
than speak God's word that he tells me to.。
But yet he chooses to anyway.。
And he patiently suffers and endures。
even though he knows the positions it's gonna land him in.。
Take Ezekiel, right, doing something。
that made no sense to anyone.。
God told him to lay on his side for 390 days。
in an illustration to God calling him。
to demonstrate how many days Israel。
had been lost in their sin, right.。
Lying down on his side, 390 days,。
just lying there like that, right.。
I don't know if you'd be patient enough to suffer that.。
Take Hosea, who had to patiently endure his wife。
running off to other men time and time and time again.。
Yet God kept telling him, "You have to keep loving her.。
"You have to keep pursuing her.。
"Never, do not leave her side."。
God uses us in patient suffering.。
So if you're suffering for Jesus right now,。
take heart, you are not alone.。
You are never alone.。
And in the meanwhile, know that your character。
is being forged through these seasons of difficulty.。
God uses it to transform us.。
Back in chapter one of James, he says this,。
"Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial。
"because he has stood the test.。
"That is the person who will receive the crown of life。
"that the Lord has promised to those who love him."。
As we remember these things, as we practice patience。
in the Lord with each other in our suffering,。
remember this too, that the Lord is full。
of compassion and mercy.。
See, as we look through these things,。
it might seem like God is this angry and fiery judge,。
itching to come back so he can show everybody what's up.。
That's not his heart, really.。
And time and time again, more often than not,。
scripture reminds us that God is full of mercy.。
He is full of compassion, that his love is everlasting,。
that his blessings go beyond a thousand generations,。
that he sacrificed his son in order to show us his love.。
And ultimately, his nature is not to punish and to slaughter。
even though that is a consequence,。
but it is to bless and to love.。
So when we're patient in the Lord,。
the result is always to come into his blessings in our life.。
Now, those might come in all sorts of ways.。
I'm not saying prosperity gospel here.。
Don't hear me wrong, okay?。
But what I'm telling you is this,。
in all the suffering that we have to go through。
in the name of Jesus, if we persevere,。
if we keep our faith in him, he will restore you,。
he will come through for you in his will,。
in his way, and in his time.。
So we hold on to patience, church.。
And one thing we cling on to in this journey of patience。
is prayer.。
We have to have prayer.。
Prayer is like one of those immovable building blocks。
of our relationship with Jesus.。
Prayer is one of those amazing privileges。
that we get as the children of God.。
But if we're honest, prayer is also a bit of a mystery,。
because it's hard to fully understand how it works.。
When you try to explain prayer to someone。
without any kind of faith at all,。
it might sound like some sort of ramblings of a mad person.。
People might think you're crazy.。
You're talking, what are you,。
talking to a magical sky fairy?。
You just whisper your wishes into the air,。
and you're just hoping that something's gonna happen.。
Somehow it's gonna make a difference.。
Well, even in secular culture, so that's one side of it.。
But on the other side of it,。
for people who don't have a faith in Jesus,。
maybe sometimes prayer seems like。
some sort of cosmic slot machine.。
So you launch a prayer into the sky,。
and it's like pulling a wheel and pulling a handle。
to see if you come up with a jackpot.。
Ding, ding, ding, yes, my prayer's got answered this time.。
Or you just throw a prayer.。
Bon Jovi has a whole song about it.。
You're living on a prayer.。
You see what happens.。
I'm just gonna say these words,。
but I don't know who it really is going to.。
I'm just gonna hope for the best.。
James gives us no room to doubt the power of prayer。
and the absolute essential role。
that plays in our relationship with Jesus.。
And we have to pray in all circumstances, in all situations.。
He says, "As if are you in trouble?。
"Is there anyone among you in trouble?。
"Let them pray.。
"If you are happy, let them sing songs of praise.。
"If anyone among you is sick,。
"let them call the elders of the church to pray over them,。
"and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.。
"And the prayer offered in faith。
"will make the sick person well.。
"The Lord will raise them up.。
"If they have sinned, they will be forgiven."。
Right, what a beautiful contrast this is。
from the type of community we started the message with.。
Right, in the beginning, we saw people out for themselves,。
living in indulgence, you know,。
and being unjust to each other.。
But James is letting us know that when we're able。
to put the material things aside,。
when our focus and our heart's desire is made right,。
not to abuse and take advantage of each other,。
but rather, now the focus becomes on ministering。
to each other, to loving each other,。
to praying for each other, to making sure。
that we're taking care of the sick,。
of offering prayers of faith.。
This is the kind of church Jesus is looking for.。
This is what it looks like when heaven meets earth.。
This is what it means to bring hope to this world.。
Because when we pray church,。
we are not talking into thin air.。
Prayer's not a cosmic slot machine.。
When we pray church, we are giving our petitions。
to the King of Kings, the all-powerful,。
all-merciful, all-loving God who loves everybody,。
the one who is able to do all things.。
This is precisely why prayer works,。
because God is who he says he is,。
because he is close to us.。
And this is why when we pray, we can have one foot。
in the mess and the craziness and the suffering。
that we all have to face in life,。
but the other foot knowing full well God is who he says he is。
and that he is good, he is merciful, he is just,。
he is there for us in our time of need.。
We stand firm on his promises when we pray,。
no matter what we are facing.。
If we're in trouble, we can pray.。
If we're happy, we can pray.。
We sing these songs, we pray this way。
because we know who God is.。
But there's one more component about prayer。
that makes it even more beautiful.。
And it's the reason why we're sitting gathered。
here today, it's the reason, it should be the reason。
why you're coming every single Sunday。
to a gathering like this.。
It should be the reason why you're gathering。
in your community groups or your friendship groups.。
It's because prayer isn't just you and the Lord.。
Prayer is something that God wants us to do。
as a community, together, as brothers and sisters,。
as family, right?。
And this is one of the wonderful things。
about knowing Jesus and being part of his family。
is that we can count on other people。
to pray for us as well.。
James says here, if you're sick, call the elders,。
the faithful, the righteous people to pray for you.。
And let me tell you, church, that our elders。
here at the Vine are faithful and righteous people.。
The colleagues I have the honor to work with。
are faithful and righteous people.。
So this is a part of the Bible we can take literally.。
If you are sick, if you are in need,。
call us, we're here for you, we want to pray for you,。
we want to hear what you're going through.。
Come and pray in faith with us。
and we will pray and we will ask God in faith,。
we will bring your petitions before God。
and allow his will to be done.。
But I also want us to hear this as well。
and really hear this, right?。
Praying for each other in this way。
is not just reserved for the leaders and the elders。
and the pastors of this church.。
But every single person who has a faith in Jesus。
has the right, has the access, I would even say。
has the responsibility to do this for each other.。
But we saw a beautiful example of this。
last week at the 11 a.m. service。
when Linda came forward in faith to receive prayer。
and in response, we as a church prayed in faith。
for her healing.。
Right, I don't know about you, but to me,。
that was a beautiful reflection of what the church is for.。
I looked on it like last week what happened。
was not planned at all.。
Right, during the 9 a.m. service, I was worshiping。
and I was praying and I heard the Lord say to me,。
you need to give people the opportunity。
to come forward and receive prayer。
'cause there's someone out there。
who is in need of prayer right now.。
So it was just a simple response of obedience。
to call for prayer from the church to someone in the church.。
And it was beautiful.。
It was amazing moment in the life of our family.。
Now could you imagine, church,。
how much more would things change。
if everyone in this room was dedicated。
to praying for each other, even outside of this space。
on Sunday, that constantly we're practicing。
our faith in this way, praying for healing,。
praying for miracles, praying for God's power。
to break through, praying for our city,。
praying for our families, praying for the world.。
The effect of this would be universe shaking, church.。
And this is what James is talking about.。
He gives us a little example of Elijah,。
a man of faith, who prayed that it wouldn't rain。
and it didn't rain, and then he prayed for rain。
and then it rained.。
James tells us this, you see, prayer really works.。
There is an effect.。
We're not talking to nobody.。
We're talking to our all-powerful, loving Creator。
in heaven, we are talking to our Savior。
when we join voices in prayer。
and make our petitions known to Him.。
And it's not just physical healing.。
It's also for the healing of souls.。
Prayer has the ability to change our destiny,。
our situations right here on this earth,。
but also in the life to come as well.。
And there's a kind of healing that takes place。
when we pray because it's able to save us from our sin.。
See, above all things, sin is the most destructive force。
in our lives, and we've all experienced this.。
We go against God's will.。
We take things into our own hands.。
We go when God says stop.。
We let the lust of our eyes and the desires of our flesh。
get the better of us.。
We use our words to tear down instead of build up,。
and we fight, we quarrel, we gossip.。
We become friends with the world,。
and we turn our backs to God.。
We have envy and selfish ambition.。
We show favoritism to people.。
We ignore the needs of the poor.。
Sin will 100% absolutely tear you apart,。
tear your relationship with God apart,。
and tear your relationship with other people apart.。
That is the destructive power of sin.。
So what do we do?。
We pray, and we confess.。
James says it this way.。
Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other。
so that you may be healed.。
And confession is one of those things。
that's become a bit lost because it's scary.。
It is a bit scary.。
It's hard to confess sin, right?。
And when we do it, we feel like there's a certain shame。
that comes because we don't want people。
to see the mess we're in.。
And so we hide, and we don't allow other people to know.。
But I think all of us in this room have also felt this too.。
Every time we hide our sin, right,。
we are actually playing directly。
into what the enemy wants us to do with it.。
And when we don't deal with sin,。
we give it the opportunity to grow, right?。
It's like a mold that just festers in the dark,。
and the longer you don't deal with it,。
the more it will grow and destroy your relationship。
with God and others.。
Paul describes it as like a web that so easily entangles us。
that it was like we're covered in these webs.。
The more we try to struggle ourselves to get out of it,。
the bigger the mess we find ourselves in.。
That is what sin does to us.。
And James lets us know here, there is a way out.。
One of the ways we deal with it,。
the way to deal with sin is through confession.。
Yes, it's scary.。
It's hard to do.。
And I've been in those situations。
where I know I've messed up,。
and I know I need to open my mouth。
and admit what I've done wrong,。
confess my sin to those who I've sinned against.。
And I've been in small groups too,。
where there's been a group of us people。
that have been walking together,。
and one of the brothers has come up,。
and he's confessed things that he's been losing himself to,。
sin that he's been wrestling with.。
And yes, there are consequences.。
This is not like a magic eraser.。
Everything makes better immediately。
when we confess our sin.。
There are consequences to deal with,。
because sin is messy,。
and it does take time to figure things out。
and pick up the pieces.。
But know this too, church.。
The end result when we confess。
is always a step towards restoration and healing.。
And I believe some of us are sitting in this room today,。
and you are suffering greatly because of your sin.。
And you feel like you're in anguish。
because of where your sin has led you to.。
And you're sick and tired of the power。
that sin has over you.。
Listen to these words.。
God can free you if you would allow yourself。
to embrace confession,。
come alongside a brother and sister,。
confess your sin with us together in front of the Lord。
so that you can be healed.。
Now I'm not saying everybody come up。
and grab the microphone right now。
and air all your dirty laundry here.。
That's not the point.。
But it is being honest about where you are.。
It is asking God to help you,。
and it is inviting someone who you trust,。
someone else who loves the Lord to come alongside you,。
to tell them what you're struggling,。
tell them what you're going through.。
I've had this addiction that I can't get rid of.。
I've hurt people in this way.。
I've been dishonest with my family.。
I've been dishonest in my practices and business.。
Whatever the sin is,。
what would it be like if we had a community。
that was able, honest enough with each other,。
that loves the Lord enough, that loves each other enough。
that we could confess these things freely。
within our community so that we can find healing?。
And in fact, I do believe this is something。
that the Lord has been growing us in。
as a church of the vine,。
especially throughout this year.。
We've seen beautiful moments of people gathering together。
to pray for those who are hurting,。
to pray for those who are lost in sin.。
We have had moments when sin has been confessed。
and people have found healing and restoration。
as a part of that process.。
So this is the task at Hand Church.。
Are we willing to do these things?。
In the light of Jesus returning,。
he has called us to be an active,。
a steadfast, a patient community of faith。
that looks forward to Jesus coming back.。
And is tirelessly working to welcome him when he does.。
This is the power of God at work。
in our lives and in the church.。
So the question is, after these five weeks,。
how should we respond?。
And time is short.。
We have no time to lose.。
And James has called us to a genuine, active,。
righteous, loyal, and prayer-filled faith.。
Will we respond to this church?。
If you would close your eyes for a second。
and just allow the Lord to speak to you right now.。
You know, and over the past five weeks,。
perhaps God has used different parts。
of this series to talk to you.。
Maybe it was in a moment of worship.。
Maybe it was in the prayer line.。
Maybe it was through one of the messages that we've heard.。
And the Lord loves us too much not to leave us。
with instructions and his desires for us.。
(gentle music)。
And so Jesus, I pray that as a community,。
that we would encourage each other in this way always.。
That you would keep our minds and our hearts fixed on you.。
That we would always be a voice that cries out。
on behalf of those who have no voice.。
(gentle music)。
That we would always be steadfast in our faith.。
Not double-minded, not hot and cold,。
but fully focused and sold out completely。
to your love at work in our lives.。
That the way we speak of each other。
would always be honoring and uplifting.。
That our loyalty to you is true,。
even when we face the temptations of this world.。
And that we are patiently waiting,。
actively working towards building your kingdom。
here on this earth.。
Jesus, we know you hear our prayer.。
And so Father, help us in this journey.。
And until we see you again face to face, Lord,。
guide us and lead us in your love.。
In Jesus' name we pray, amen.。
(gentle music)。
(gentle music)。
