Amen. Thank you, Francesca.。
It's so good to see you all.。
Now, I want to share with you about an experience I had about 10 years ago.。
I took a Christmas Bible quiz and I got a really low score.。
So this was a little bit traumatizing for me.。
So I had a lot of sleepless nights.。
I woke up, there was tears in my eyes thinking of it.。
But my score was, I was really shocked at how much details of the Christmas story I got wrong.。
So I thought it would be fun this morning to do a little Christmas Bible quiz.。
So are you ready for that?。
Come on.。
I told you I got a bad score.。
So you're set up for success.。
Okay, so here's the first question.。
Jesus was born in a stable.。
True or false?。
If you think it's true, raise your hand.。
Okay, the answer is false.。
The Bible actually doesn't say where Jesus was born.。
So that's the first one.。
All right, second one.。
There were three wise men who brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.。
True or false?。
True.。
Okay.。
So that is also false because it doesn't mention that there was three wise men.。
Good job.。
You did good.。
That was good.。
The next one.。
What animal did Mary ride on during the journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem?。
Was it a donkey?。
Was it a mule, a horse, or does the Bible not say?。
So if you think it was a donkey, raise your hand.。
If you think it was a mule, if you think it was a horse, I'm the only one who thinks it's a horse, okay.。
Or the Bible does not say.。
The Bible does not say.。
Mary probably walked.。
See, I'm serious.。
But a Christmas place always have a donkey or a mule in there, right?。
Okay, and here's the fourth one, last one.。
This is the last one.。
Where did the Magi from the East meet Jesus?。
Was it in a cave, in a manger, in a house, or the Bible does not say?。
So the first one is cave.。
Okay, the second one is the manger.。
Okay, we got a few.。
The house.。
And then the last one, the Bible does not say.。
Okay.。
So the Magi met Jesus in a house.。
Because they actually came almost two years after Jesus was born.。
And so Joseph and Mary were living in a house.。
Matthew 2.11, you can look it up.。
So, okay, I'm curious.。
Who got two or more right?。
How about three or more?。
What about four out of four?。
Okay, we have one person.。
Congratulations.。
We have a Bible scholar among us.。
This is great.。
So why am I doing this Christmas quiz?。
Well, what I wanted to highlight through my own experience, but also I think through our experience right now here together is that our knowledge from Christmas about Jesus, it comes from pop culture, from Christmas plays, from tradition, but not really from the biblical account.。
And so what happens over time is that these traditions, they have made Jesus into someone he is not really.。
They made him meek and mild.。
He's baby Jesus.。
And it's like I call it the tamed Jesus.。
It's not the Jesus of scripture.。
Where all the rough edges, all the things that might challenge us, they're, what do you call it, sanded off.。
And so it's this Jesus that we hear and learn about in pop culture, but it's not really who Jesus is.。
And what I want to do with you today is I want to take you to some of the birth narratives of Jesus where we can get a glimpse of the real Jesus, the untamed Jesus, the Jesus that has the power to change people's lives.。
The Jesus that has the power to turn our lives around and the Jesus that speaks authoritatively yet lovingly into our lives and has something to say to us.。
And so we're continuing in our message today.。
The message series Christmas.。
I hope you've been enjoying it.。
Have you been enjoying it?。
Has been good?。
Yes.。
Okay.。
I think it's been great.。
I've been enjoying it.。
And our topic for today is of signs and swords.。
And so to explain who this untamed Jesus is, the real Jesus, I want to take you to the gospel of Luke chapter 2 and starting in verse 25.。
It says this.。
Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon who was righteous and devout.。
He was waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was on him.。
It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah.。
Now Luke introduces Simeon as a devout man.。
And we see this devotion because Simeon is waiting for the consolation of Israel.。
Now what is that?。
What is the consolation of Israel?。
Well, in the Old Testament, the prophet spoke of a time where things in Israel will be set right, where things in Israel will be restored, where God will bring wholeness to Israel.。
So it's also talking about the Messiah, that the Messiah would come, the anointed king, to set things in order.。
And Simeon's devotion is showing that he is patiently waiting for that.。
He hasn't given up on that.。
He's an old man at this point in time, but he's patiently waiting.。
And when we think about wanting things to happen, I don't know about you, but we live in this immediacy culture, right?。
Where we want things to happen right away.。
We don't want to wait.。
But a lot of times when it comes to the things of God, actually we have to be patient and wait on God's timing.。
And so you see Simeon doing this here.。
Now another thing we learn about Simeon is that the Holy Spirit was upon him, which is in the Old Testament, of course we're in the New Testament, but it's a way of describing prophets.。
So we should understand Simeon as a prophet.。
And what we're about to read are some prophetic things that Simeon is saying.。
But let's continue.。
So verse 27 says this.。
"Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts when the parents brought the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the law required."。
So Simeon had been brought by the Spirit into the temple, so he's being led by God.。
Jesus' parents are also shown as being devout, Joseph and Mary, because they're going to the temple, whether it's the eighth day, the naming of Jesus, or whether it's the 40th day of dedicating the firstborn son to God, they're being obedient to God by bringing him to the temple.。
Let's continue.。
So in verse 28 through 33, it says this.。
"Simeon took him by his arms and praised God, saying, 'Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace.。
From my eyes I have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all nations, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel.'。
The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him."。
So Simeon takes Jesus in his arms.。
I always wonder in that scene, does he explain anything, or do they just let him grab the baby?。
How does that all play out?。
But he takes Jesus in his arms, and then he starts to speak prophetically over the identity of who Jesus is.。
And he talks about that Jesus will bring salvation.。
He is the consolation of Israel.。
He is the one who will restore things, renew things, and put things into right order.。
And he is not just doing that for Israel, but he is doing that for all people.。
And so then we are told that Mary and Joseph, when they hear that, they are marveling.。
Just this music through their ears.。
I mean, what incredible words spoken over your child.。
Amazing.。
But now you are wondering, like, he talked about untamed Jesus.。
Like, so far, things seem the way we probably know them.。
But now we are going to get into the part that a lot of times is skipped or not talked much about.。
And this is the second prophecy of Simeon.。
And that's where we see a more true picture of who Jesus is and how people relate to Jesus.。
So let's look at that.。
So up until now, Mary, this was music to her ears.。
But the next words are actually hard.。
Verse 34. Let's continue.。
It says, "Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother,。
'This child is destined, the cause of falling and the rising of many in Israel,。
and to be a sign that people will be spoken against,。
so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed,。
and a sword will pierce your own soul too.'"。
Wow. What just happened?。
This was like positive news beforehand, right?。
And now suddenly there's some heavy words spoken over Jesus and over Mary as well.。
We're not told how Mary responds, but we can only imagine.。
That's a lot of the process and the take in and try to understand and make sense of.。
So let's unpack the second prophecy.。
Let's take a closer look at what this is talking about and what it means.。
Just to give the big picture, basically this is about the rejection, how people will reject Jesus.。
How there will be some who accept him, but how a lot will reject the salvation that he will bring.。
But let's look a little bit at it in more detail.。
So we're told that Jesus' destiny calls the falling and the rising of many,。
and that he will be a sign that will be spoken against,。
so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed.。
So whereas the falling and the rising speaks of the falling is rejection, the rising is accepting Jesus.。
But then the second part, the sign that will be spoken against is just rejection.。
But it also shows how we relate to Jesus, how we treat him,。
reveals what's in our hearts and how we relate to God, because Jesus is God with us.。
Now I want to especially focus on unpacking the imagery of falling and rising,。
which often is used in the New Testament to describe responses to Jesus.。
So Simeon is drawing on this familiar image that you find throughout the Old Testament, also the New Testament as well.。
And it's that of a cornerstone that some accept and they receive salvation, and some reject, and it's their stumbling stone.。
So in Isaiah 8, verse 14, it says this, "He will be a holy place for both Israel and Judah.。
He will be a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.。
And for the people of Jerusalem, he will be a trap and a snare."。
Isaiah 28, 16 says this, "So this is what the sovereign Lord says.。
See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation.。
The one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic."。
And then Psalm 118, verse 22, "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone."。
So the falling and rising response to people reacting to Jesus differently,。
those who are falling, they are rejecting who Jesus is, and they're not receiving him.。
And they ultimately fall, and there is experience of judgment.。
And those who are rising are open to Jesus, accept him, place their faith in the cornerstone, and experience salvation.。
Now, the reality is we go between rising and falling a lot of times.。
So for example, Apostle Paul, he was falling.。
He was persecuting Christians.。
He was going after them.。
He was even involved, you know, whether actively or just as a bystander, in that way,。
supporting people being Christians being killed.。
Stephen, in Acts.。
But then he had a Jesus encounter on the road to Damascus.。
And he was blinded, but got God's attention.。
And he went from falling to rising and to being open and accepting Jesus。
and being one of the great proclaimers, you know, in early Christian movement of Jesus。
and establishing churches and planting churches.。
And so for us, there might also be seasons where we have been open to Jesus。
but never really reached a conclusion about him.。
And then where we were rejecting Jesus for a season, and maybe we're open again.。
So we move between this rising and falling.。
But Jesus, he has come to stake out the claim that he is King of kings, Lord of lords.。
Jesus polarizes his contemporaries.。
There were those who wanted to kill him, and they eventually did.。
They nailed him to the cross.。
And there are those who believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God,。
and who received him as that.。
But what you see in the Bible, what you don't see in the Bible,。
is people simply saying, "Oh, he was a good teacher. He was a nice guy."。
There is not such a mild response to Jesus.。
People react strongly one way or the other to him。
because Jesus did not leave that option open to just treat him as, "Oh, he's a nice guy,"。
with the things that he said, the things that he proclaimed.。
He was polarizing, of course, with a purpose not just to antagonize,。
but because he had come, he was on a rescue mission to save and deliver.。
And a lot of times when we need rescuing, we actually need a shaking up,。
otherwise we don't get it.。
So Jesus came to shake things up and to be very clear about who he is.。
The only way to, or if Simeon's prophetic word is correct,。
if Jesus came to polarize people to cause some to rise and some to fall,。
why is it that most people today don't seem to be rising and falling?。
Why don't people today have the polarized response to Jesus?。
Well, I think for one, if people never have heard of Jesus,。
how can you have a response to it?。
But part of it is what I brought up earlier, where we have tamed Jesus.。
We have a wrong image of who Jesus is, not the real Jesus.。
And that Jesus is fiction.。
They have come to believe in a version of Jesus,。
one that Christmas plays and traditions and pop culture give us.。
People only want to believe that Jesus was a nice guy, a good teacher,。
and a man with moral principles.。
We try to make Jesus into something we can manage,。
that fits neatly into our lives, so that we can be in control。
and just call him when we need him,。
but not deal with Jesus at another point in time.。
We don't really want to deal with Jesus' claims about his identity.。
We want Jesus on our terms.。
This is true for Christians as well, whether you're a Christian or not a Christian.。
Everybody does this at one point or another.。
But there is no historical evidence of a Jesus that was just a good teacher.。
The Bible gives us a different picture.。
There is a famous Oxford scholar from the 20th century called C.S. Lewis,。
and he has a quote that I want to read to you.。
"I'm trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing。
that people often say about him.。
I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher,。
but I don't accept his claims to be God.。
That is the one thing we must not say.。
A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things that Jesus said。
would not be a great moral teacher.。
He would either be a lunatic on the level of the man who thinks he's a poached egg,。
or else he would be the devil of hell.。
You must make your choice.。
Either this man was and is the son of God,。
or else a madman or something worse.。
You can't shut him up for a fool.。
You can't spit on him and kill him as a demon,。
or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God.。
But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.。
He has not left that open to us.。
He did not intend to."。
So I wonder if some of us today,。
if we've been preferring this tamed Jesus that C.S. Lewis just talked about is not an option,。
where we keep Jesus at arm's length in our life。
because we don't really want him to break into lives, to speak into our lives.。
But Jesus, this Jesus is an idol.。
This is not a real thing.。
We create Jesus basically in our own image, the way we want Jesus to be.。
But it's not the Jesus of Scripture,。
not the one who fiercely loves us,。
who lays down his life for us,。
who is worth sacrificing for, giving our lives for.。
But the real Jesus, the untamed Jesus that Simeon profanely spoke of。
causes the falling and rising of people.。
He has the power to transform your life.。
He is the son of God, King of kings and Lord of lords.。
The real Jesus influences our decisions, choices of friends and behavior。
and stirs in us a desire to live sacrificially,。
to contribute to the well-being and flourishing of those around us.。
That's what real Jesus does.。
He speaks powerfully into our lives.。
The real Jesus is worthy of our adoration, worship, obedience and sacrifice.。
He's not a nice to have.。
He's essential. He's King of kings.。
He deserves our worship.。
So accepting Jesus into our lives is not a guarantee of perfect days ahead。
and an easy road in life.。
Sometimes we give the impression as pastors。
that if you become a Jesus follower, you will never have a problem again.。
Now, Jesus blesses us incredibly and he loves us perfectly.。
But it does not mean that there is not challenges that we face。
or that he allows for us to go through.。
As a Christian, we often find ourselves at a crossroad.。
Do we choose comfort and convenience or do we choose obedience to Jesus?。
When you obey Jesus, there might be a cost.。
The loss of money, the loss of a job, the loss of previous plans,。
the loss of reputation, the loss of a relationship.。
And Jesus, even today, he speaks challenging things to us,。
calling us to difficult tasks like mediating a conflict。
that you'd rather not get involved in,。
forgiving someone who has hurt you, loving our enemies,。
standing up for something that is not right in your company,。
your organization, and being willing to potentially lose your job,。
leaning into a conflict and working towards reconciliation.。
In a previous role in a church when I was a senior pastor,。
I had a leaders' meeting and somebody just started laying into me,。
"Your sermons suck. Your preaching sucks.。
You're not inspiring. The way you handled it."。
I mean, just went off for 10 minutes and it was so hard.。
I got a little bit defensive because it was so strong.。
I tried not to be, but then other people started getting defensive for me.。
And my human reaction, the comfortable reaction would be,。
"Well, if it's so bad, why don't you just leave?"。
But of course that's not what Jesus asked me to do.。
He asked me to lean in, to go to the person,。
to understand what's on the person's heart,。
to communicate that how this person communicated。
was not a way that I could receive it or anyone could receive it,。
and do that hard work. And that was very difficult.。
So Jesus, he calls us to do difficult things, but they are always good.。
When he asks us to do something difficult,。
he is always working through that in us and through it.。
Maybe that also means standing up for someone when no one else does.。
Giving sacrificially of your time to a person in need,。
even if it's really difficult.。
If Jesus is just at arm's length and nice to have,。
why would you do that?。
If Jesus is your Lord and he asks you to do it, we say, "Yes, Lord."。
Or waiting on God to do something that he has promised us,。
and waiting on his timing, and not on our own timing.。
Because a lot of times, I mean, I'm the same way.。
I want things to happen right now.。
But sometimes God asks us to wait patiently, to trust him, to rely on him.。
And to just keep coming to him with whatever is going on,。
and asking him for grace and strength.。
And he gives us the grace and strength.。
Now, in the early 2000s, I was attending a church.。
I was working at Morgan Stanley. I was a businessman at the time.。
And there was three services in a row where they had missionaries share.。
And I was so powerful, and I was so moved after every Sunday.。
I had tears flowing down my eyes,。
which was not my normal response to a sermon at that time.。
So after the second Sunday, I was like, "Is God trying to tell me something?"。
And then on the third Sunday,。
I realized that God was calling me to do something else,。
that there was a change of plans,。
and that I needed to act right away.。
So that night, I went into my office.。
I cleared out my office.。
And then the next day, I went with jeans and a t-shirt to my boss,。
and I told him that God had called me to do something for him,。
and that I had to quit my job.。
To my surprise, my boss commended my courage for doing that.。
He also told me not to show up at a different investment firm anytime soon.。
[laughter]。
Because they invested a lot of resources in me,。
with licenses and all that stuff.。
Now, this was not what I had planned.。
This was not my plan. I never planned to be a pastor.。
Or at that time, I just knew God wanted me.。
I didn't even know exactly what.。
And then suddenly, I found myself in this mess,。
because I quit my job.。
I don't know exactly what I'm doing.。
I told my parents.。
"Ooooh."。
Yeah, my parents, "You make a big mistake. Why didn't you stay there?"。
That's why I didn't ask my parents beforehand,。
because I knew what they would say.。
But my prayer was that they would come around,。
that they would understand,。
that they could see that God had called me.。
And then I ended up, in the meantime,。
as I was applying to different roles and things,。
I took a job at an old company that worked for a lot lower position.。
And I even wondered, "God, did I make a mistake?。
Did I hear you wrongly?"。
But I ended up joining Mercy Ships, a medical mission ship.。
I did a discipleship training school with them。
for five months in West Africa.。
They do life-saving surgeries,。
bringing hope and healing through their practical work,。
but also through sharing the gospel.。
I helped out in the finance department and also had that schooling.。
And for me, even though it was messy,。
when Jesus calls us to do things, a lot of times they're messy.。
There's a season where stuff gets stirred up,。
but it is always good.。
God always has a good reason and a good purpose for it.。
And for me, this was like my key turning point,。
where Jesus set me on a different trajectory,。
because he had different plans for my life。
than I had come up with on my own.。
I wanted to be successful in business.。
My father was successful.。
I wanted to be like him in this way.。
But Jesus had a different plan for me.。
So this is what happens when the real Jesus enters your life。
and is Lord of your life.。
He speaks into your life.。
He calls you to obedience.。
And Jesus comes into our lives and turns things upside down.。
This is messy, but it always is designed to bring life.。
Jesus is working out his good purposes in us and through us.。
Now, just think also when the Holy Spirit confronts us in sin,。
when he asks us to stop watching pornography。
or to stop cheating on our taxes or whatever it is.。
It's not nice to be confronted in those things.。
It always is messy.。
But when we repent and we do what Jesus asks us to do,。
he brings wholeness.。
He brings life.。
He does something good.。
But that only happens when Jesus is Lord of your life,。
when you give him that space to speak that way into your life.。
But a lot of times we love keeping Jesus at arm's length。
because we want to be in control.。
Now, receiving difficult tasks, you know,。
to stand up in your company for something that's wrong。
or to change a career or to lean into a difficult conversation。
with somebody who has not treated you very nicely,。
that's uneasy to get that sort of news and direction.。
It involves not just joy, but there's also some pain in there.。
Just imagine how Mary must have felt when Simeon was speaking。
those prophetic words over her and in Jesus.。
He said, "And a sword will pierce your own soul too."。
That is Simeon's prophetic word over Mary.。
Now, what does that mean?。
Well, it's not a physical sword, but a metaphorical sword。
where she will experience pain because her son Jesus。
is being rejected and because she sees him suffer.。
You know, that's not an easy burden to carry.。
But at the same time, Simeon also had revealed,。
and in other settings as well, that Jesus was the consolation of Israel,。
the Messiah who would bring salvation to all people.。
So even though there is suffering, there is also joy。
in knowing what God is doing.。
And if God calls you to do something,。
he gives you the grace and the strength to do it.。
He never asks you to do something that you cannot do.。
He doesn't set you up for failure.。
He gave Mary the grace and the strength to do it.。
He gave me the grace and strength to do it.。
They go through a messy transition,。
and God will give you the grace and the strength to go through it。
when you are obedient, when he's leading you.。
He will provide for you, and it is always for the good.。
You know, God has good plans and a good purpose for you.。
But if we block him out of our lives or keep him so far away,。
we're keeping Jesus from doing that work in our lives.。
I want to right now invite the worship team to come up.。
Now, some of us, you know, we have been keeping Jesus at arm's length.。
We have bought into whether we purposefully wanted to,。
into this tamed Jesus that we can control,。
that is only a nice to have when we need him.。
We call on him like a magic genie, you know,。
help us and give us what we need.。
But we have not surrendered all areas of our lives to Jesus.。
What Jesus deserves are all.。
He wants your whole heart.。
He doesn't just want a little part of your life.。
He wants all of your heart.。
And whatever Jesus does is always for the good.。
And so my question is, are you giving him room to speak into your life,。
to speak words of encouragement, to speak words of direction,。
to speak words of correction as well?。
Are you giving Jesus that space in your life?。
And when we give Jesus that space in our lives, this is the real Jesus,。
the one who turns our lives around, who takes our broken lives,。
our messy lives, and who turns them into something beautiful,。
who lets us know that he loves us, that he has perfect plans for us,。
and who works them out in our lives in a way we can't even imagine or dream of.。
But it doesn't mean that every part is always easy.。
It does get messy.。
So what I want to do, I want to invite you all to stand.。
And if you, whether it's for the first time or today again,。
want to make yourselves available to Jesus and say,。
"Jesus, I don't want to cut you out of my life or certain parts of my life.。
I want all of you. I want you to speak into my life.。
I want you to mess things up where things need to be shaken up,。
where you have something better than what is there,"。
then I want to encourage you to stretch out your hands,。
and I would just love to pray over you.。
So you stretch out your hands as a symbol of just wanting to receive from Jesus right now.。
"Jesus, I thank you so much that you love us so much that you don't just let us be,。
but that you have come here to reveal who you are so that we can know that you love us.。
You have come to shake us up in areas where we're living in brokenness。
or we're heading in directions where you have something else for us."。
I want to pray right now for those who are stretching out their hands。
that you--yeah, as a surrender to you, Lord, we know that honors you.。
Will you meet them? Will you speak words of life, of encouragement, of goodness,。
and direction, correction, whatever it is that they need, that we need, Lord?。
Will you speak those words to us?。
And will you shake things up, and will you bring what is good, what is life,。
what is beautiful, because you are working, you are stirring, you're moving.。
And Lord, I ask that you forgive us where we've cut you out of our lives.。
Also pray for those who've been struggling with strongholds for a long time,。
where they just seem to not be getting out of patterns of brokenness.。
Lord, I pray that in your power and by your name, Jesus, you break chains right now,。
that you break those addictions, that you break those areas where we just keep living in sin,。
that you bring us into your beautiful life, into your holiness, into your righteousness.。
So we thank you, we love you, and we worship you.。
And I pray all this in your name, Jesus. Amen.。
