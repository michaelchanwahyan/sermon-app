a redemptive story of Jesus Christ,。
and that celebrates in the freedom and grace。
that such a story brings.。
This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,。
but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,。
desiring for God's kingdom to take root。
and bear fruit in local soil.。
A church that sees salvation as holistic,。
transforming God's people for God's work。
and equipping a generation to represent God's heart。
to the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the persecuted.。
Imagine this church committed to seeing the family。
as integral to all that it's called to be and do,。
involving intentional, committed,。
and authentic relationships across all levels.。
It is the sort of place where both the young。
and the old feel cared for, supported, and equipped.。
A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions。
come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic。
that honors and embraces a richness in diversity。
that marks us as the body of Christ.。
It is a church that is willing to innovate。
and express faith creatively,。
reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity。
as glory to Him.。
A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,。
and passionate to see this invade。
all aspects of their lives,。
where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith。
rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.。
A church that does not make its Sunday services。
the exclamation mark of its existence,。
but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence,。
a time of service, love, and engagement。
that inspires and emboldens all equally。
for the conversation that lies ahead.。
A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.。
This is our city.。
This is our church.。
This is our home.。
- Good morning, church.。
It is so good to see you.。
Welcome.。
Hey, if you're looking for a place,。
you can find a seat right now.。
Yeah, so my name is Tim.。
I'm one of the pastors here.。
And every week, we come here to gather,。
to explore who Jesus is,。
to understand what it means to know Him, to follow Him,。
and to also lift up His name and praise.。
So as I was praying and preparing for today,。
I was thinking of a friend of mine who is a worship leader,。
and he does something that I always find powerful,。
and I actually wanna do that with you.。
Does that sound good?。
Yes?。
Right, so he encourages people to give God thanks,。
but what he does is he says this.。
He's like, if you are breathing,。
you have something to be thankful for.。
If you slept in a bed last night,。
you have something to be thankful for.。
If you ate a meal this morning,。
you have something to be thankful for, 'cause God is good.。
He is the provider of everything we have.。
And for us, the truth is a lot of times,。
there are challenges that we face, right?。
There are things that even we're facing right now,。
and so it's easy to just focus on them.。
There's actually still a lot of things。
that we can give God praise for.。
So what I wanna encourage you right now,。
and children, this is for you as well.。
I want you to think of two things that you are thankful for。
and actually turn to your neighbor。
and tell them what you are thankful for.。
Does that sound good?。
Can we do that?。
Two things you're thankful for.。
Let's do that right now.。
All right, hey, I would love to hear。
like one or two things that you said.。
So would somebody be willing to share,。
what are you thankful for?。
Family, okay, what else?。
Your wife, oh, he's scoring some points.。
Good job, Kieran.。
What else?。
For the people serving here,。
yes, we are so thankful for them.。
You know, when we come to worship,。
actually one way of entering into God's presence。
is by giving thanks and by praising him.。
And so I wanna actually prepare our hearts right now.。
There's a verse from Psalm 100, verse four.。
It says, "Enter his gates with thanksgiving。
"and his courts with praise.。
"Give thanks to him and praise his name."。
So I wanna invite everyone to stand。
and would love to pray for us。
as we prepare our hearts for worship.。
Jesus, we thank you that you are so good to us.。
You have given us so much.。
You have given us everything.。
You've given us family, you've given us spouses,。
you've given us people who serve,。
you died for our sins, you gave us breath, Lord.。
And we right now just wanna turn around。
and just give you praise 'cause you are worthy of it.。
You deserve it.。
You deserve our songs.。
You deserve our thanksgiving.。
And right now, Holy Spirit,。
we just wanna welcome your presence.。
We wanna welcome your presence.。
And we wanna turn our hearts and our attention to you.。
I pray all this in your name, Jesus, amen.。

- You know a lot of times we make God too small.。
We forget how great God is.。
You know it's our circumstances that are weighing us down.。
It's sometimes it's a battle in our minds.。
But God is the miracle worker.。
He is the savior, he is the redeemer.。
He is the one that can make a way where there is no way.。
And as we were worshiping I just had the sense。
that God wants to raise our faith.。
You know that's why he brings us together.。
He wants to raise our faith in our awesome and mighty God.。
So let's sing this again.。
Come on people.。

- All right, time to bring it back.。
I love seeing all the conversations,。
love all the connections happening.。
Hey, there are several things。
that I wanna keep you in the loop and keep you updated on.。
First, as I already mentioned,。
we have your bring your own lunch.。
Basically, after the service,。
either you've brought your lunch,。
you put it in the fridge,。
or you go out, grab something, come back,。
and we're just gonna have lunch together.。
Now, this is a great way of meeting people here,。
of connecting.。
It's also a good way of catching up。
for those of you who are part of this community.。
So just encourage you to come.。
It's always a great time.。
So bring your own lunch。
just after the service happening then.。
Next, we have, and I'm really excited about this,。
on June 1st, we have our parenting workshop,。
2 to 4 p.m., and the topic is。
I have big emotions too.。
And basically, it's about,。
the workshop's about identifying your parenting triggers。
and building stronger relationships with your children.。
And our speaker is Dr. Elaine Tang,。
and she's gonna help us to cultivate。
some self-awareness for effective parenting.。
We're also gonna explore values。
that we carry ourselves with parenting,。
and emotions, and learn practical strategies。
to enhance our relationship with our children.。
So there's a lot of packed in there.。
This is gonna be awesome.。
So if you're a parent, or you know someone。
that could benefit from this,。
I wanna encourage you to invite them.。
So we do four of these a year,。
two in Cantonese, two in English.。
This is the English one.。
We have our Cantonese one in March.。
We have another one coming up sometime in the near future.。
This is one way that we wanna love, and serve,。
and contribute to the flourishing of our city.。
So this is one intentional and strategic investment。
that we make, that we bring high-quality speakers。
who run very practical workshops。
so that anyone who comes will be equipped,。
will gain some new tools that they can walk away with。
and their family can flourish.。
And so if you know anyone,。
share it in your mom's groups, your dad's groups.。
I don't know if their dad's usually in enough groups, right?。
It's usually mom's groups.。
Share it in your mom's groups.。
Invite people.。
And by the way, we've made it free.。
We didn't want any barrier for anyone to come.。
So if you're single parent, traditional family,。
doesn't matter, you are welcome to come.。
But do please sign up and let us know。
because there will also be some beverages。
and some little treats and things.。
So this is gonna be amazing.。
All right, next, we owe you an update.。
Vision Sunday happened in March.。
So on Vision Sunday, we shared, we wanted to,。
our aim, our goal was to raise 400,000 Hong Kong dollars。
as a new church plant.。
And so part of that, of course,。
is for us to continue to carry out our mission,。
our vision of bringing the gospel to this community.。
And I just, I'm really excited.。
I wanna share with you how much we raised.。
Drum roll.。
Yay!。
705,440 Hong Kong dollars.。
So praise God.。
He did more than we could ask for, imagine.。
So thank you for your generosity in that.。
Now, you might wonder what's next,。
what's gonna happen with this.。
So there's just a couple of things。
that I wanna share on that.。
First, 433,000, I'm not gonna say the whole number,。
will go to operations and ministry expenses and reserve.。
Now, what does that involve?。
For one, it just involves us simply being able。
to gather here on Sundays.。
It involves K-alpha, it involves K for C,。
it involves anything that happens in here.。
And so this just allows us to continue。
to carry that forward and gives us some stability。
by building a reserve.。
Since we're a new church, this is significant,。
important for us to have a little bit of reserve。
and operation security.。
Then the second part, 272,000,。
will go into special outreach and community projects.。
So you already heard about the parenting workshop.。
That's one of those where we seek to reach out。
and just bless our neighbors。
and form relationships with them.。
Also, we're in the process of starting a youth group.。
So this will also be used to do special events。
for youth in this community and to connect。
and to reach them.。
Then we also are in the process。
of forming relationships with mission partners,。
people who serve here in the community。
in incredible ways and have an impact.。
We want to partner with them.。
We want to pray for them.。
We want to also support them financially.。
Because we could try to do the things they are doing,。
but we would at best do a mediocre job.。
They do an incredible job,。
so we want to partner with them。
and strategically invest in those partnerships。
where we can contribute to the flourishing。
of people here in this community.。
So we're in the process with one organization.。
Once we're through with that,。
and that's signed off and everything,。
we'll announce that.。
Our aim is to have two of those mission partnerships。
established by the end of the year.。
So you can pray that the Holy Spirit also leads us。
in both of these and just leads us。
to the right partnerships as well.。
So I'm excited.。
This really is helping us make a major investment。
in this community, in this city,。
to turn lament into joy。
and for us to continue to work as a church.。
So praise God.。
Thank you for your generosity.。
Now, right now we're going to transition。
into a time of our tithes and offerings.。
I want to invite the welcome team to come up.。
So we are--part of our worship is our finances,。
how we steward them.。
Everything we have is from God.。
So this is one way of us loving God back。
with our finances,。
making funds available for him, for his work.。
And so thank you for all your generosity。
and all your giving always.。
Here are different ways that you can give.。
There is digital ways, which are popular.。
There's also the buckets going around with envelopes。
if you prefer that.。
What's helpful for us as a new church plant is always。
if you set up online automatic giving。
that helps us with planning。
and we know what we're working with.。
So if you consider us your home church,。
please do pray about that.。
But I would love to pray for the offering。
and also the Vision Sunday giving。
and just pray a blessing over that.。
So let me pray.。
Jesus, we are humbled by how you have been providing。
for us in this church plant.。
Every step of the way, you have been faithful。
and you have provided what we need when we need it.。
And we want to give you praise for that.。
We thank you for all that's been raised by the Vision Sunday,。
for all the people who were able to give.。
And we want to lift up what's given today。
and what was given then,。
that it may be used for your glory and for your purpose。
to reach the city, to love the city。
with your good news, the gospel message,。
and also to do works of justice and mercy。
for the marginalized。
and those who need others to advocate。
and to step up for them as well.。
And so we want to give you all the glory。
and I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Amen.。
All right. Hey, I'm excited。
because I want to invite a very cool person up.。
Chapman, Pastor Chapman.。
Come on up. Okay.。
Watch out. Don't trip.。
Can you hear me here? Okay, come on.。
Come in here. All right.。
So Chapman is one of our pastors。
and I'm going to pray for him right now.。
Does that sound good?。
All right. You can stretch out your hands towards him as well.。
Jesus, I thank you for my brother here who loves you.。
I pray that you powerfully speak through him。
as he proclaims your word,。
that you just anoint him, anoint his tongue,。
and that you also prepare our hearts to receive。
what it is that you want to say to us.。
So I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Amen.。
Oh, wow. Your lights are pretty bright.。
Bright here. I hope you don't mind.。
But yeah, I can take this off as well.。
Oh, wow.。
This reminds me of the very first day。
that I first saw light in my life.。
Ah, what a wonderful memory.。
Actually, I can't stop telling that story again and again in my life.。
Oh, but since--yeah, I know.。
We've never met before, right?。
This is the first time I meet you.。
So I'm just going to let you know a little bit about myself.。
Hi, everyone. My name is Bar Timaeus.。
I'm Jewish, and I'm not going to tell you about my age.。
But, you know, in our language, which is Aramaic, by the way,。
Bar, my name Bar, means son.。
And my father's name was Timaeus.。
So my name literally means son of Timaeus.。
I guess when he named me, he was expecting me to be like him.。
But then I guess he was really frustrated or disappointed the day。
when he found out I was actually blind.。
When I was young, my parents, they loved me.。
They don't normally talk about my condition,。
but they actually taught me how to survive.。
I remember there was one night at home.。
I was supposed to be sleeping, and I heard them crying outside,。
and they were saying something like--they're praying, saying,。
"Forgive our sins, Lord," and I don't know what that means.。
But later I heard somebody said,。
"Actually, blindness and other disabilities is normally a form。
of punishment from the Lord."。
I remember that night I went home at dinner, and I told my parents,。
I said this, I said, "Father, Mother, is the Lord punishing us?。
That's why I'm blind?"。
That was the longest silence I've ever experienced.。
My father and my mother, they haven't said another word that night,。
and I just decided I'll never bring that up again.。
Don't get me wrong, my parents, they do love me.。
They took good care of me, but eventually they passed.。
Everybody does, right?。
Someone like me, I wasn't able to do any kind of work,。
because any kind of work, it would mean physical labor,。
like farming or fishing, and I couldn't see,。
and I couldn't do any of that.。
I had no income.。
So soon after my parents were gone, I ended up on the streets.。
What else can a blind man like me do except begging for money,。
begging for people to spare some change for me?。
So every day when the rooster crows, "Cuckoo, cuckoo,"。
I'll just make my way to the market.。
I'll go outside the market and wait for people to come.。
And I know what time people come.。
It's normally when I could feel the heat of the sun on my face.。
That's the time when people started coming.。
And you know what? I'll tell you something.。
If you want to be a beggar outside the market, there's a strategy.。
Yes, being a beggar, you need strategy as well.。
So what I would do is I would go to the entrance of the market,。
but I cannot be too close to the stores,。
otherwise the store owners would get mad at us,。
and they would drive us away.。
But I can't be too far away either, because if I stay too far away,。
people, after they are leaving the market, they would either miss us,。
or they would have given all their spare change to those beggars。
closer to the market, so it takes strategy.。
And me and my buddies, we are really good at strategies,。
and one day we found out a great strategy.。
Do you know who are the most generous people in all of Judea?。
It's actually those people who are going to the temple。
to present the sacrifice to the Lord.。
And so me and my friends, we found a good spot outside the city of Jericho,。
because there were a lot of travelers going or going to。
or coming back from Jerusalem.。
And so we would sit there and just wait for someone to drop by.。
And one day, one day there was another large crowd passing by。
and headed to Jerusalem.。
Oh, I thought, you know, it could be some Pharisees, rabbis, and their followers.。
But let me tell you, they are bad business.。
You know, the Pharisees, they are known for their love for money.。
They are very stingy people, but they love to put on a show for everyone.。
So what they would do is, when there's a large audience,。
these Pharisee rabbis, they would come to people like us,。
and they would start talking about, oh, how the law instructs them。
to care for people like us.。
And they would say, "Oh, yes, I love the law. I love the Lord,"。
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.。
And then in the thunder of applause, everybody was clapping,。
and they would throw us a few cents, not even enough for my lunch.。
They would even expect us to go to them and say, "Oh, thank you for your generosity, sir.。
Thank you so much."。
The memory of that makes me sick.。
But just out of curiosity that day, just because I do want to find out who it was,。
I shouted. I said, "Excuse me, who are you following?"。
Yeah, like that. Nobody responded.。
I think after five times, I have shouted the same thing.。
Finally, perhaps someone was kind enough, or maybe they were too annoyed by me.。
They finally yelled back at me and said, "Oh, it's Jesus of Nazareth,。
what do you blind men know about the rabbi?。
Just keep quiet, man. Don't embarrass yourself."。
Jesus of Nazareth. Come on, surely I've heard of him.。
Everybody in town have heard of him.。
People talk about him in the market. They talk about him on the streets.。
Of course, they were skeptical at first.。
They would say something like, "Oh, what good can come out of Nazareth?"。
Or they would say, "A Galilean? Are you kidding me?。
Is he here to teach us how to fish?"。
Well, but then I started to hear stories.。
There was a story about him healing a paralyzed man.。
I don't know how he did it, but what I heard was that man literally picked up his man and walked away.。
And I heard another story about him driving demons out of a man into some pigs.。
That was a hilarious one, right?。
But later I heard of a story of Jesus opening the eyes of a blind man in Bethsaida.。
I'm like, "Really? Someone like me, a blind man, can be healed?"。
Then I remember I used to follow my parents to the synagogue,。
and I would listen to the reading of scriptures.。
It was a brief moment in my life when I would feel I'm normal,。
because everybody else would be doing the same thing.。
They would just sit there and listen attentively to the reader or to the preacher, to the speaker.。
I felt I could blend in. I felt that moment.。
I'm normal. I could just do what everybody else does.。
That's the one thing that I really enjoy.。
And I remember there was this particular book written by the prophet Isaiah,。
and then he talks about this figure, they call him the Messiah, the Son of David.。
He will bring us the kingdom of peace, of shalom.。
And not only that, but there is a line in this book that says,。
"The eyes of the blind will be opened, the ears of the deaf will be unstopped,。
the lame will leap like a deer, and the mute tongue will shout for joy."。
Every time when they read that, I just couldn't stop weeping.。
What beautiful words. What a wonderful promise.。
And then I start to wonder, would this Jesus of Nazareth be that anointed one,。
that promised Messiah?。
Could I be a part of his kingdom and experience shalom and feel complete for once in my life?。
When that name was mentioned that day outside the city of Jericho,。
my entire body started shaking.。
I knew I had to call him. I knew if someone could help me, that would be him.。
The next moment, I found these words just coming out of my mouth.。
"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me, please."。
What else could I ask of a king?。
And he's just not a normal king, he's the king of kings.。
What else could I ask him but to have mercy on a nobody like me?。
I actually don't know if Jesus has heard me, but those around surely did,。
and they weren't very happy.。
They were saying, "Keep your voice down, man."。
They were saying, "It's not time to ask for money. Get lost, you beggar."。
Or someone say, "He's a very important man who's got important business in Jerusalem.。
He's not here to entertain you. Just go home, you dude."。
Usually when I hear this kind of stuff, I would try to hide.。
I would feel super embarrassed. I would run away.。
But in that instance, I knew I'd rather lose face and make a fool of myself。
than to lose the one opportunity to get my life changed.。
I wanted this so badly that shame couldn't stop me.。
Their mean words and their rebuke couldn't stop me.。
I gathered all my strength, and I yelled at the top of my lungs again,。
"Son of David, help me! Have mercy on me!"。
And suddenly, I no longer heard footsteps.。
The whole crowd quieted down as if they were waiting for something to happen.。
And I heard a man's voice, "Cheer up, mate! On your feet! He's calling you!"。
I could tell that voice, even though I couldn't see,。
I could tell that voice was directed to my direction, but I couldn't believe.。
So I had to confirm. I said, "Me?"。
He said, "Yeah, you blind man. He wants to talk to you."。
"You mean the Messiah didn't just hear me, but he actually stopped to see me?"。
"I've never had someone who want to spend time with me ever since my parents were gone."。
"Everybody here, they tried to stop me, but Jesus, he stopped for me."。
"These people, they made me feel like I'm a nobody, but that day, Jesus made me feel I'm a somebody."。
I was so overwhelmed, but I jumped to my feet at once, and I walked towards that voice,。
and I could sense the crowd just parted like the Red Sea in front of me。
until I reached the other shore where Jesus was waiting for me.。
I will never forget his first words to me, and in fact, he asked me a question.。
He said, "What do you want me to do for you?"。
"What do you mean, what do I want?"。
"No one has ever asked me such a question."。
"Who would care what a blind beggar wants?"。
"And if Jesus is king, I should be the one doing what he wants."。
"I should be the one bowing before him and said, 'Your will be done, my Lord.'"。
"I should be the one asking him that."。
And yet, he's asking me what I want.。
Here, standing in front of me was a man who was king, and yet he acted like a servant.。
With tears in my eyes, I uttered my wildest dream to him.。
I said, "My master, my Lord, I want to see."。
I never dared to say those four words, "I want to see" to anyone in my life.。
People would just call me silly, or they would say, "It's impossible."。
"It's unrealistic." "Stop daydreaming."。
I never imagined someone would care to listen.。
Just now I told you, when I used to listen to God's word in the synagogue,。
I felt I'm normal. But you know what?。
That day, I suddenly realized I felt I was a normal person。
when someone actually stopped to listen to me.。
And what really blew my mind was that that someone, standing there,。
asking what I wanted, listening to my every word, he was God himself.。
"Go," he said. "Your faith has healed you."。
Before he finished that sentence, I felt this warmth, this burning sensation in my eyes,。
and then it was brightness.。
It's like walking out of a completely dark room into the bright, sunny day.。
My faith in Jesus opened my eyes.。
And when I looked up, I saw a face. I saw the face.。
I remember in the synagogue, they used to pray this blessing over us.。
"The Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you."。
"The Lord turns his face towards you and give you peace."。
That's the face I saw that day.。
That's the very first face, indeed, in my life I've ever seen.。
And that's the face I'm going to see in eternity, the face of Jesus.。
At that moment, I knew I wanted to follow him for the rest of my life.。
I knew I'll go wherever he goes.。
He's my healer. He's my savior. He's my king.。
I want to spend the rest of my life asking him, "What do you want me to do for you?"。
Or even better, "What do you want me to do with you, Lord?"。
I was a blind beggar sitting on the side of the road.。
But Jesus came. He stopped. He listened. And he responded.。
So I'm telling you guys, today, if you cry out to him, he would do the same for you.。
He would come into your life. He would stop for you.。
He would listen to you, and he would respond.。
What is that you want to tell him today?。
Where in your life you need him to heal you and save you, to zozo you?。
Come to him today and cry out to him, "Jesus, have mercy on me."。
[silence]。
Greetings, my dear friends. Peace be with you.。
[applause]。
Oh, thank you for that.。
How are you guys doing today?。
My name is John. I'm one of the disciples of Jesus.。
Isn't the story of Bartimaeus amazing? Can you give him a round of applause?。
[applause]。
But I want to tell you this. What's even more wonderful for me personally。
is that the day when Bartimaeus received his sight, I received mine too.。
The day when his eyes were open, so were mine.。
I remember that day very well. It was the final days we spent with Jesus。
before he was arrested, he was tortured, and finally crucified in Jerusalem.。
In fact, we were on our way there. We were walking towards Jerusalem,。
and we came all the way from Galilee, and then we passed through Jericho in Judea,。
and we were headed towards Jerusalem.。
And that was the Passover period, so there were lots of people going to Jerusalem。
alongside us, and we had a large crowd following us.。
And you know Jesus, just being Jesus himself, he would seize every opportunity。
to teach the people about the kingdom of God.。
But I could tell, being his friend, he was quite burdened inside.。
It's in the small details. It's in the way how he looked at us.。
It's in the way how he would spend longer time away from us in solitude,。
like just praying by himself.。
And he also told us, not just once, not just twice, but three times,。
that whatever is in store for him in Jerusalem, it's pain and suffering and death.。
He said he's going to be killed there.。
You know, of course, none of us wanted that to happen, right?。
He's a good friend. He's a rabbi.。
My best buddy, Peter, actually tried to talk him out of it,。
but yeah, it didn't end too well for him.。
But even what's more bizarre was that he told us after he died,。
he would rise again in three days.。
We had no idea what he was talking about.。
But so far, let me tell you, following Jesus, yeah,。
that kind of life is nothing short of miracles, surprises,。
and also riddles that none of us really understood.。
The one thing we were sure, though, was that he was the Son of God,。
and he is the Son of God.。
He's the Messiah that we've been waiting for.。
We even saw him talking to Moses and Elijah on the top of a mountain.。
He is going to be a Messiah, and what that means is he should be a conquering king.。
He will lead us in glorious victories and establish his kingdom。
over those Romans and other Gentiles.。
At least that was what I was told and what I had believed ever since I was a boy.。
So that day, yeah, back to the story.。
That day, we were passing by Jericho, and everybody cheered for us。
like what you did just now.。
The whole town gathered literally on the two sides of the road just to see Jesus.。
After all the miracles and all the healings, you wouldn't be surprised。
if Jesus is the most popular, famous Jewish man on the planet, right?。
Everybody wants a piece of him.。
So sometimes I feel a little bit overwhelmed and, "Oh, that's too much."。
And you know, me and my brother James, we volunteered to be Jesus' bodyguards,。
like, "Hey, stop, stop there. We're his security detail."。
And we would exercise a little bit of crowd control.。
Okay, just let me tell you a fun fact.。
Me and my brother James, we have a nickname.。
We're called the Sons of Thunder because of our temper, I guess.。
Anyway, but suddenly that day when we were getting out of Jericho,。
we heard a voice, a very loud voice that says, "Jesus, Son of David,。
have mercy on me."。
"Oh, Son of David. Huh, this guy knew what he was talking about, huh?"。
It seems we're not the only one who believe Jesus is the Messiah。
because that's what that phrase, "Son of David," means.。
So I tried to look around, but I don't see who's talking.。
And perhaps there was just too many people.。
So then someone from the crowd just told me, "Oh, it's just a beggar.。
He was probably asking for money."。
I'm like, "Okay, if he thinks Jesus is a rich Messiah,。
then he must be misguided."。
"Well, look at us. Look at me. Do I look rich to you guys?"。
"I'm not rich. Jesus is not rich."。
"But all right, anyway, just a beggar, just looking for money.。
False alarm. Let's move on. Let's carry on.。
We got to go find a place to rest before sunset, you know?。
It's really dangerous out here in the wilderness in Judea."。
But just as I was taking a few more steps down the road,。
that same voice yelled again, "Son of David,。
have mercy on me!"。
And I thought, "Okay, I'm the bodyguard. I should deal with that."。
But before I walked to deal with him, Jesus, he stopped.。
I'm like, "Oh, come on.。
If someone has any spare food for this guy,。
let's just give it to him so we can all be on our way.。
Come on, come on. I don't have time."。
You know, "Now a glorious journey to Jerusalem.。
It's going to be delayed.。
Who knows what's going to happen in Jerusalem?。
Jesus may actually become king there, you know,。
and we would have a royal status.。
He's messing with our schedule right now.。
Could somebody just take care of him?"。
You see, when would the procession of a king。
be interrupted by some homeless man, right?。
So he just want to go.。
And Jesus says, "Call him."。
You know his voice is always so gentle, yet full of authority.。
And so we did. We called that guy over.。
And a few moments later, we met the guy with the loud voice,。
and on top of that, he also had long and dirty hair.。
He had worn out clothes and some very unpleasant smell.。
Oh, that guy was blind.。
So Jesus looked at him and said,。
"What do you want me to do for you?"。
"Wait, what did he just say?"。
I immediately turned and looked at my brother James,。
and he did the same. He just looked at me.。
Because the day before,。
Jesus asked the two of us the exact same question.。
See, we were on the journey to Jerusalem,。
and we knew something big, something important was going to happen.。
So of course, Jesus mentioned he was going to suffer and die,。
and all that we know.。
But James and I, we decided to go and talk to Jesus.。
And we said, "You know, we've been following you for so long,。
and since the beginning, we were your first disciples.。
Surely we deserve a front seat in the kingdom of God, right?"。
Can I get an amen for that?。
No, none of you agree with me. That's okay.。
And so we asked Jesus, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask."。
And Jesus asked the same question,。
"What do you want me to do for you?"。
Well, we shamelessly asked to sit at his right and his left.。
Yeah, we want the fame. We want the power, right?。
Come on. We have laid down literally everything to follow Jesus。
in the last three years.。
We were by his side the whole time,。
and that's what we deserve.。
That's what we are entitled to, right?。
But look at this blind beggar.。
What did he do to deserve this?。
What has he done to earn this favor。
that the Messiah himself would do something for him?。
He hasn't followed Jesus for a single day.。
He never preached the good news of the kingdom like we did.。
He never healed a sick person or drive out a demon like we have.。
Why would he deserve this?。
And I heard he said, "My master, my Lord,。
I want to see."。
And yet, there he goes once again.。
As always, the miracle happened.。
And Bartimaeus, he immediately joined the company。
and followed Jesus.。
He became part of us.。
He became a brother.。
And then I realized,。
Jesus didn't stop to perform a miracle.。
Jesus actually was there to call a man.。
Just like the day when he called me and my brother James and Peter,。
he stopped and performed a miracle for us。
and called us to follow him.。
Whatever Jesus saw in me,。
he saw in Bartimaeus too.。
Who am I to think that I deserve and he doesn't?。
Isn't it only because of Jesus' grace。
that we are both saved and restored?。
That day, outside the city of Jericho,。
when Jesus opened the eyes of Bartimaeus,。
he opened mine too.。
While Bartimaeus, he could be physically blind,。
I, myself, and many other disciples,。
we were indeed spiritually blind.。
We were blind to who Jesus was。
and his real mission here on earth.。
We were so obsessed with the image of a conquering king。
that we were blind to the suffering servant。
right in front of our eyes.。
We were so obsessed with the success and achievements。
we want Jesus to give us。
that we were blind to his call,。
which is to follow his examples。
and serve those around us.。
Our role as his disciples should be,。
supposed to be, to bring people to him,。
not to stop them from coming to him.。
And we've been doing such a poor job.。
And no wonder we're also blind to the poor,。
to the vulnerable, to the marginalized,。
to the needies around us.。
In our spiritual blindness,。
we only focus on what we can gain in this life。
and we forgot what we could give.。
We ignore the marginalized.。
We say that their problem is not our problem.。
What's even worse,。
when they try to voice out their problems,。
we silence them.。
We tell them this is not the place and time。
to say these things.。
Let's do it later.。
Let's don't do it here.。
We don't have time for you.。
But Jesus, Jesus doesn't stop people。
from expressing their needs.。
Instead, he stops for them.。
He sees them.。
He listens.。
He responds.。
Jesus doesn't just want to heal the physically blind.。
He also wants to open the eyes。
of the spiritually blind as well.。
What kind of a church are we?。
Are we a spiritually blind church?。
Are we a spiritually blind disciple?。
That we are blind to the needs of those around us?。
That we just turn a blind eye。
or we look away?。
Or are we blind to who Jesus really is。
and what he wants to achieve in this earth?。
Are we spiritually blind。
that we actually can't see Jesus' heart for the others?。
That day Jesus opened my eyes.。
I once was lost, but now I'm found.。
I was blind, but now I see.。
I know what kind of a disciple。
I want to be since that day.。
I want to be the kind of disciple of Jesus。
that would stop for people,。
that would see people as people,。
that would listen to them,。
that would respond to their need.。
And what about you, my friends?。
What kind of a Jesus follower would you want to be?。
I wonder where you find yourself。
outside the city of Jericho today.。
Are you the one sitting at the side of the road。
like Bartimaeus。
and you're carrying with you a physical condition perhaps。
or maybe an emotional or even a relational issue。
and you need to cry out for Jesus' help?。
Or perhaps you're one of those standing in the crowd。
like the disciples,。
suffering from spiritual blindness.。
You're either blind to Jesus,。
his identity and his mission on earth。
or maybe you're blind to the needs around you.。
You know, if you're blind to the needs。
of the people around you,。
that affects not just how you would interact with them,。
that affects how God would interact with them。
through you as well.。
So no matter where you are today,。
Jesus is here。
and he wants to heal you and save you,。
to zozo you.。
All you need is to say,。
"Have mercy on me, Lord."。
And I'm just wondering right across this room right now,。
who would love to pray this prayer with me?。
I myself, I definitely need to pray this prayer.。
"Lord, have mercy on me, open my eyes."。
I wonder who wants to join me in this prayer.。
If that's you, I invite you to stand where you are。
and close your eyes.。
You know, sometimes it doesn't really matter。
what we're seeing physically.。
It matters even more what we can see spiritually.。
And Jesus, he's so kind,。
he's so faithful, he's so loving.。
He wants to open your eyes。
and my eyes here today.。
So church,。
I can't do this on your behalf.。
You must come to him.。
I can only show you the way to Jesus。
and you have to be the one to cry out to him.。
"Have mercy on me, Lord."。
Why don't we do it now?。
(silence)。
Jesus, you didn't just heal Bartimaeus that day.。
You didn't just open his physically blind eyes.。
You healed your disciples.。
You healed their spiritual blindness.。
And God, today I pray that you would come into this place。
and do the same.。
Whether it's a physical condition that needs to be zozoed,。
maybe an emotional one, a relational one, a mental one.。
Jesus, I pray you would so kindly come and zozo us.。
But I also ask you would come。
and open our eyes,。
especially those of us who are spiritually blind like myself.。
That we will turn a blind eye。
to the people around us.。
Here in Yuen Long, here in Hong Kong,。
or maybe just right next door, our neighbors,。
the person sitting next to us in the office,。
or when we are on the streets, those who need you.。
Father, I pray that we would not just write them off casually。
and we wouldn't just walk past them。
without even looking at them.。
Not in a strange way, but...。
Father, I pray you would give us your vision,。
your perspective,。
when we are walking the streets of Hong Kong,。
the streets of Yuen Long.。
We would actually be able to see the need,。
or even to listen to them,。
and respond to them.。
Come Holy Spirit, help us.。
[music]。
All these pieces broken and scattered。
In mercy gathered, mended and whole。
Empty handed, but not forsaken。
I've been set free, I've been set free。
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound。
That saved a wretch like me。
I once was lost, but now I am found。
Was blind, but now I see。
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound。
That saved a wretch like me。
I once was lost, but now I am found。
Was blind, but now I see。
I can see you now。
I can see the love in your eyes。
Laying yourself down。
Raising up the broken to life。
I can see, oh I can see you now。
I can see the love in your eyes。
Laying yourself down。
Raising up the broken to life。
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh。
Amazing grace, amazing grace。
How sweet the sound。
That saved a wretch like me。
I once was lost, but now I am found。
Was blind, but now I see。
Amazing grace, amazing grace。
How sweet the sound。
That saved a wretch like me。
I once was lost, but now I am found。
Was blind, but now I see。
Oh, I can see, I can see you now。
Oh, I can see the love in your eyes。
Laying yourself down。
Raising up the broken to life。
I can see, I can see you now。
I can see the love in your eyes。
Laying yourself down。
Raising up the broken to life。
You know, as we were worshipping, I was just literally picturing。
our blindness, you know, falling from our face,。
our spiritual blindness just, you know, going away.。
And I just wonder, what kind of church would we be。
if we would shake off our spiritual blindness?。
How would people see this gaze of Jesus' love through us。
in the city, around here?。
You know, I just wonder.。
Now, I don't know about you, but I long for that.。
I want that, and I know I have blind spots myself.。
So I want to just pray into that and pray that over us。
that we can be a church that shakes its blindness。
and that can see so that others can see and know Jesus.。
So Jesus, we pray that you would free us。
from our spiritual blindness, where we get caught up。
with things like John was caught up with.。
I want this position, I want to sit here,。
I want things to be this way, I want to be comfortable.。
That you disrupt us and that you show us。
how you want us to look at things,。
how you want us to look and listen to the people around us.。
That you, us as a church, that you give us words,。
that you give us love, that you give us sacrifice,。
that we bring as we pour out your love over the city,。
as we pour out the love of the people,。
that you set us free from the spiritual blindness。
that puts us on a different mission,。
which is not your mission.。
Jesus, put us on your mission.。
Lord, where we've gone wrong, we say,。
"Jesus, I'm sorry.。
Forgive me where I've gone wrong.。
Lead me in repentance.。
Lead me in your love."。
So we thank you for this work that you've done。
right now in this room, and we pray that by your grace,。
not out of our own strength, but by your grace,。
that we live this out more and more as a church community.。
We pray this in your name, Jesus.。
Amen. Amen.。
Wow, what a gifted and talented actor, preacher we have.。
So let's give Chapman a hand.。
Thank you so much.。
You know, it takes boldness to try that.。
It's not easy to try something in front of people。
like a different way of preaching.。
But it really--I don't know about you,。
but it really helped me to enter into the story。
in a different way and to see a lot more。
than I've seen before.。
So thank you, Chapman, for giving it a go.。
Also, I just want to say thank you for everyone。
who serves here.。
We already had earlier that--。
and as we were giving Thanksgiving, but it's true.。
You know, we have so many people in so many different ways。
on different days who serve and who make this happen.。
Thank you for partnering with us.。
Thank you for just leading us so beautifully。
in worship today.。
Thank you all for coming, for being part of this community.。
We love you all.。
We hope to see you at the Bring Your Own Lunch.。
That's happening now, but if not next week.。
Also, if you would like prayer, we have a prayer team here.。
They would love to pray for anything, honestly,。
that you need prayer for.。
It doesn't matter what it is.。
They would love to pray with you, love to bless you.。
So please do take advantage of that.。
All right, love you all.。
Have an amazing Sunday.。
See you at Bring Your Own Lunch.。
Okay, bye-bye.。
