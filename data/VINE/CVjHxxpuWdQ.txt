Words, voice, sound, speech, the very things that are simple to you have become the sweetest。
of all sounds to me.。
You know, it's hard to describe what it's like to be rendered silent by an angel for。
a year, to have those words and the voice and the sound and the speech stilled within。
you.。
It feels a little bit like the silencing of your soul, to be able to speak and then at。
a command, nothing but silence for a year.。
My dear wife Elizabeth always jokes that in all of the long, long years of our marriage,。
it was the only time she ever knew true peace.。
True peace.。
If you lend me your ears for a few moments, I want to tell you a little bit about what。
true peace actually is.。
My story, to understand it, you have to first of all understand my ancestors.。
I was literally born into the priesthood.。
I'm from the tribe of Abidjar and from the youngest of ages, all I've ever known is what。
it is to be a priest, be a round priest, to grow up with that as my family.。
You may not know this, but there are 18,000 priests in our land.。
We're broken into 24 different divisions of 750 priests in every division.。
For the majority of our time, we're just in the villages, in our hometowns and studying。
the scripture and helping people to understand God and the Torah and the prophets.。
It's a joy to be able to walk pastorally with those around us.。
But for two weeks in the year, for two weeks, each division is invited up to serve in Jerusalem,。
to go to the temple, which shines like a jewel on the top of Mount Zion, the beauty of the。
temple shown to all people.。
We get to be there for two weeks, serving the worshipers in Jerusalem, helping with。
the sacrifices, providing the daily rituals of prayer and song and music.。
And we get to be there as the priest on behalf of all of the people of the land.。
I've often thought to myself in those two weeks when I'm standing there in the temple。
how privileged I am, how chosen I am of God, that God would choose me from a young age。
to be a priest.。
The idea of being chosen is actually what my story is all about.。
One of the things that we do when we're in those two weeks in the temple is one of the。
priests, only one, but one of the priests is chosen by lot to be the one who can go。
beyond the curtain into the Holy of Holies, the very place where God's presence is.。
I mean, you can serve as a priest all of your life and never be chosen for that honor.。
I had been a priest for 70 years, but on that day, on that one special day, my luck came。
up.。
I had heard stories, of course, from the other priests over the years of what it was like。
to be behind the veil, behind the curtain, of what it was like to go inside, to be in。
the very presence of God.。
Every one of them had talked of the stories of the glory that it felt, the true beauty。
of being in the presence of God.。
Each one of them had spoken about the intimacy of God's presence, and I longed for it.。
But the thing that they spoke of the most, every single priest who had been beyond the。
curtain, the one thing they spoke of the most, that they sung songs about, told stories about,。
was this, that it was the first time in their lives that they truly knew peace.。
Peace.。
Peace is an important concept for us Jews.。
Actually, that's not a good way of saying it.。
Let me say it like this.。
Peace is the very foundation and structure of our faith.。
It's what our faith is all about.。
You Gentiles, you often think of peace simply as the idea of the cessation of an argument。
or the absence of war, but for us Jews, peace isn't about the absence of something.。
It's about the presence of something.。
It's not about what's not there anymore.。
It's about what has come to be there in that moment.。
For us Jews, peace is described by this one word in our tongue, shalom.。
Shalom, literally translated, means wholeness, but it carries with it a much broader set。
of ideas.。
The ideas of being safe and secure.。
The ideas of being restored.。
The ideas of knowing perfection and trueness.。
The ideas of an intimacy that enables you to truly rest.。
There are other words, too, within this idea of shalom.。
The word shalem, which means restoration.。
The word shalomet, which means to have perfection.。
So for us Jews, when we think of the idea of peace, we're talking about a moment where。
we come together to know the perfection of God, where we come to understand what it is。
to truly be human, to be made in His image, where we are finally in a place where wholeness,。
just as we were created to be, actually is.。
It's a wonderful thing.。
One of my old rabbis once described it to me like this.。
He said, "For us, shalom is, it's like the coming together of two opposing opposites,。
two separate opposites coming together to form one new shared reality."。
When those things that are opposed to one another come together and form a new relationship,。
this is wholeness.。
It is restoration, perfection, shalom, peace.。
All of which brings me back to that day when my lot was chosen.。
I remember feeling incredibly excited.。
This was my moment to go beyond that veil into the Holy of Holies to witness something。
of God that I had never witnessed before.。
I remember grabbing the curtain and pulling it back and walking on in.。
Oh, the joy I felt.。
And as the curtain closed behind me, suddenly I heard nothing, silence, which when you come。
to understand the rest of my story is quite ironic.。
But in that moment, it was beautiful.。
I had just gone from the inner courts where the slaughtering of the animals was, where。
the worship was taking place, where the prayers were being prayed, the cacophony of noise,。
and then suddenly, absolutely silence.。
Nothing.。
Just me and the presence of God.。
It's hard to describe to you the joy that it feels to have the whole world turned off。
and only God be with you.。
It's hard to explain to you what it was like for me to suddenly know that I was truly,。
deeply the only one who was in the world for Him.。
It felt like the whole world had stopped and there I was caught in the love of Yahweh.。
It was like I was truly me for the very first time.。
In fact, I felt younger.。
I felt like a new man.。
I felt like everything else had changed and suddenly I was who I was truly created to。
be, the image of God.。
Before God, it was wonderful.。
I almost forgot that the reason I was there was to take the incense and to light it.。
So I started to walk towards the incense table and then I realized I was not alone, that。
there was another person there.。
I thought at first maybe it was another priest who snuck in, who had defied the laws, who。
were going to be killed in the presence of God, but to my relief and horror, it wasn't。
a man at all.。
There was a being next to the incense table.。
Now I had heard of angels.。
I had read about angels.。
I had even taught about angels, but nothing ever had prepared me to encounter an angel.。
It was overwhelming.。
Every part of my body was shaking and trembling.。
It felt like the whole of his gaze was internalizing everything that I had ever done.。
I was overwhelmed with the smallness that I felt in the glory of his presence, the one。
who is holy, the one who is not holy.。
And as I was trembling, he walked forward and he said these words.。
And when he opened his mouth, it felt like the whole of the universe was saying what。
he was saying.。
He says, "Do not be afraid, Zachariah, for your prayers have been heard and answered.。
Elizabeth, your wife, will be with child and she will bring forth a son and you will name。
him John."。
And then he began to tell me what my son would do.。
My son would be filled with the Holy Spirit from birth.。
My son would be the one who would prepare the way for the coming Messiah.。
My son would help to invite Israel to repentance for their sins so that they could be prepared。
for the arrival of none other than the Son of God.。
My son!。
I mean, the words of the angel seemed like fantasy to me.。
Words that I could not comprehend, ideas that I could not fathom, a hope that I had for。
many years pushed down, gotten rid of, pushed away, silence.。
And I thought in that moment that what if this doesn't happen?。
What if those angels' words were not true?。
So I turned to face him.。
And I said, "How can any of this be possible?。
For having you not seen how old I am and Elizabeth is even older, how could we ever?"。
It was not my finest moment.。
I mean, think about it.。
I'm finally in the wholeness of the presence of God.。
I'm finally the person I was truly created to be.。
And in the moment of being encountered God's presence, I turned my back on him.。
I doubt.。
I doubt the very words that have come from his mouth.。
I doubt the promise that he has brought to me.。
I turned my back on the one who has opened his arms to me and immediately I felt old。
again.。
The angel then said these sobering words, "Because you have doubted, Zachariah, your。
tongue now will be stilled and you will not be able to speak again until the prophecy。
I have brought comes to pass," and a weight came in my mouth.。
My tongue stilled within me.。
I could no longer make any sound.。
Every day from that moment onwards, every day was a reminder to me of the reality of。
my doubts and my turning of my back on another.。
Every moment of every day realizing that I could not express anything to anyone.。
And yet every day, Elizabeth, pregnant with our child, growing and growing.。
She had never been more radiant nor beautiful.。
And then that day, the day I thought would never come, the day when Elizabeth gave birth。
to a boy.。
And then on the eighth day, when we circumcised our children, the child is brought to me and。
all of the family are leaning in, wanting to know, "What will I name him?"。
I grab a parchment and I start to write down the name, "John."。
And I write it out as much as I can in bold letters, "John, his name will be John."。
And in that moment, you will never guess what happened.。
I felt the rush of the Holy Spirit.。
I felt like I was lifted up where I was.。
It was almost like the rest of the world disappeared again.。
And there I was back in the holy of holies once more, back in the presence of God again.。
And in that moment, I felt my tongue loosened in my mouth.。
I felt like all of those months of agony where I was walking in the brokenness of my doubt。
were washed away, and now suddenly a new moment had arrived where two opposing entities, me。
who had turned my back on God and God who is holy and mighty, now could come together。
again as one.。
I felt forgiveness.。
I felt life.。
I felt the joy of what it is to know my sins were washed away.。
And in the beauty of that moment, I began to shout.。
I began to praise.。
I sang a song.。
And I sang, and I sang, and I sang, and I sang, because peace had come, and peace was。
here, and peace always demands a song.。

[APPLAUSE]。
One of my earliest childhood memories。
was hearing the word "Meshiach."。
My father, at the end of every day,。
would gather up the children and put us on his lap.。
And he would tell us the stories of the prophets of old,。
the stories of our ancestors.。
And the stories he would always go to。
were the ones about the Meshiach.。
I heard that name long before I remember hearing my own name.。
"Meshiach" in our tongue literally means "the anointed."。
The idea of somebody being a Meshiach。
is that that person has been anointed by Yahweh,。
that Yahweh has set them aside for a certain period of time。
to do some things that Yahweh wants them to do.。
And so my father would tell us stories。
of Samuel and Isaiah and King David,。
the ones who had been anointed with oil,。
Meshiached with oil, to become a Meshiach for the people.。
The idea of the oil was really important.。
It was really something that my dad would talk about all。
the time.。
He would say, in the same way that we pour oil on our hands。
when our hands are chapped and sore and dry and dirty,。
and the oil brings them to softness and a healing。
and a restoration and new life, so the Meshiach,。
when they are anointed by God, they。
are used to bring healing and comfort and revival and life。
to the dry and cracked and weary people of the world.。
And, oh, the stories that he would tell。
were just so wonderful to us.。
It was our favorite time in the day.。
And my dad, after a while, began to tell us a story。
about a coming Meshiach, not just an anointed one,。
but the anointed one, the one who would come and pour。
his oil, if you will, on all of humanity,。
the one who would come and set us all free,。
washing away our sin, restoring us in relationship。
with Yahweh, the one who would establish for all time。
a place of repentance and life and the fullness of everything.。
And when my dad told the stories of a coming Meshiach,。
we would lean forward with joy in our hearts.。
We could not wait.。
But waiting seemed to be all we ever did.。
In fact, my people have been waiting for years, generation。
after generation after generation,。
with the idea that this Meshiach, this Messiah in your tongue。
will come one day, and we're still waiting.。
When I came of age, my father's stories。
didn't seem to hold the same vibrancy anymore.。
It's interesting, isn't it, how a joy and a fantasy。
from childhood can become an adult's embarrassment。
when you get a bit older.。
And I remember feeling to myself that this longed。
for hope of a coming Messiah was still such a long way away.。
Should we really hold onto that hope?。
I mean, is this really an expectation we should have?。
I almost felt like my father had set me up。
to fail, that my father had put in me。
this desire for the coming together of all things。
under God once again, and it was never going to happen.。
The tension between me and my father grew.。
I began to find his attitude, his constant hope,。
his constant talk about this coming Messiah,。
it just grated on me.。
I felt like it was just air that had no substance anymore.。
I wonder if you've ever felt a little bit like that.。
When I came of age, my mother had a friend。
whose son was a shepherd, and he said。
he would be willing to take me as an apprentice under him,。
and I couldn't leave quick enough.。
I gathered up my stuff, said goodbye to my family,。
and ever since then I've been a shepherd.。
The shepherd has been a wonderful life for me.。
I've been truly blessed with it.。
I get to spend every single day, the majority of my time,。
outside in the beauty of the hills of the Judean wilderness.。
I mean, if you haven't seen them,。
you should see them someday.。
They are just glorious.。
And people often think that shepherds are lonely.。
That's a bit of a misconception.。
We're not lonely at all.。
We actually travel in groups.。
There's usually three or four of us。
with our flocks at any one time.。
And my favorite time of the day。
is right towards the end of the day,。
right towards the night where we all sit around。
and we start a fire.。
It can get pretty chilly in those Judean hills,。
and we sit around a fire together,。
and as we're talking around the fire,。
you'll never guess what happens.。
The other men will always turn to me and say,。
"Tell us some of the stories your father told you.。
Tell us of the messiahs of the old。
and the longing we have for the messiah to come."。
And irony out of all ironies,。
the one who had ran away from the stories of his father。
has now become the one who tells the stories of his father。
to the others.。
I tell them with the same vibrancy, the same joy,。
the same enthusiasm my father said,。
but it's shallow and hollow inside of me。
because I don't really believe a word of it.。
The men hang off every word.。
I'm a great storyteller,。
but I still feel like I'm setting them up to fail.。
And then one day, everything changed.。
I remember the night well.。
I remember it because it was like。
the blackest of all nights.。
It was like a darkness had almost come across the land.。
It was like formless and a void.。
It almost felt to me a little bit like。
what our scriptures describe,。
right at the start of all things,。
the beginning of the world and the voidness and darkness。
that was hovering there in creation.。
And then in the darkness, suddenly a glorious light.。
It was as if the whole sky lit up.。
There was a shaft of light that shone down from the sky。
that came upon us as shepherds,。
and we were overwhelmed immediately.。
I remember thinking to myself。
that I should be blinded by this light.。
It was that bright, but I wasn't blinded.。
In fact, the opposite happened.。
For the first time in my life, everything seemed clear.。
I mean, I could almost see things。
like I had never seen them before,。
as if for the rest of my life before,。
my eyes had only been half open.。
And then a being appeared.。
I can't describe to you what this being was like.。
It wasn't human,。
but there was a sense of majesty and glory and honor to it.。
And immediately we were terrified.。
We fell onto the floor.。
We were shaking uncontrollably.。
And then a voice came to us.。
And when this voice came,。
it was like the whole universe was saying this.。
And for me personally,。
it wasn't like I was hearing the voice。
with my ears externally.。
It was as if the voice was reverberating inside of me。
and almost coming out of me.。
It said, "Do not be afraid, shepherds,。
for we bring you great news and a joy and a tiding to all,。
that today, this very day,。
your Savior, your Messiah has been born.。
In the town of David,。
you will find a child wrapped up in clothes。
and lying in a manger."。
And almost as soon as those words had happened,。
suddenly a great heavenly hosts appeared before us,。
a choir of angels,。
and they sang a song, a holy song,。
glory to God in the highest.。
And on earth,。
peace will rest on those upon whom His favor is.。
And as soon as it happened, they were gone.。
Silence was upon us.。
And we, with our faces down on the soil,。
trembling as we were,。
no one made a noise,。
almost as if none of us wanted to break the sacredness。
with the ugliness of human words.。
And then something happened。
that hadn't happened to me in years.。
Tears came.。
Tears just started to stream down my face.。
First of all, they were tears of shame,。
tears of the many years。
that I had turned my back on my family,。
tears of the many years。
that I had ignored the promises of the prophets of old,。
tears where I had turned my back on my faith。
and not believed, not longed,。
not held the waiting in my heart,。
tears of shame for what I had done.。
But then the tears were warm and salty,。
the tears of forgiveness,。
the tears that only come when we know。
that we're no longer at enmity with God,。
that we're no longer separated from Him.。
I began to cry tears of joy,。
knowing that I am forgiven,。
knowing that because the Messiah has come,。
our longed-for wait was over,。
knowing that those that had been separated once before。
by sin from a holy and majestic God。
were now being brought back together again,。
two opposites becoming one whole.。
I realized in that moment, peace was here,。
true peace, shalom like we had always wanted.。
The desire was now here.。
And in this child, in a manger,。
wrapped with cloth,。
was not just the idea of peace,。
not just the offer of peace,。
but in this one, it was peace.。
Emmanuel, God with us,。
the incarnation, fully God, fully human,。
in the one entity, I mean, that's what peace is all about,。
opposing things, coming together。
to form a new perfect whole in Jesus.。
We now see not just the idea of peace,。
but the person of peace,。
stepping into the gap, meeting us in our brokenness,。
drawing us now into reconciled,。
restored relationship with God.。
I was filled with peace.。
We jumped up, left our sheep behind,。
ran to Bethlehem.。
And when my eyes saw the child for the first time,。
I remember thinking to myself,。
if only my father was here,。
because his dream, his hope,。
had literally come.。
And you need to know,。
just a week before your celebration of Christmas,。
that your hope, your dream, has also come.。
You need to know that the same washing of my sins,。
those warm and salty tears that set me anew and afresh,。
the same washing has happened now for you.。
You need to know that if you have ever felt。
at enmity with God, away from Him。
because of your sin and your brokenness,。
that you've been now drawn near。
because of the Mashiach, the Messiah has arrived.。
You need to know that just like for me,。
there is a song for the not so holy,。
of a future that is not so distant from us.。
For the Lord has come.。
Do not be afraid.。
As you look towards this week,。
may you know the peace of Christ upon you。
like never before.。
May you know that in that child,。
there is reconciliation, restoration,。
because God is not distant.。
He is here.。
Would you pray with me?。
I wonder whether you'd stand.。
I'd love to pray with you.。
I'm gonna pray as Andrew, not as Shepherd, okay?。
Just so you know.。
(congregation laughing)。
Let's pray.。
Father, we are grateful,。
grateful for this moment of sacredness。
as we listen to the Christmas story of peace。
in a different way this morning.。
Father, we're thankful that peace is not。
at the hands of the herds of this world.。
We're grateful that peace is not won for us。
by might or force or violence.。
We're grateful that peace is not the absence of conflict,。
but the presence of you, even amidst the conflict.。
We're grateful, Lord, that the peace that we get to know,。
the one that truly restores our heart and our soul。
is a peace that you purchase on the cross,。
that your resurrection proves,。
and the descending of your Spirit seals in us,。
a peace to know that our sins are forgiven,。
and that our lives will be made new.。
Lord, I wanna pray for anyone here in this room。
who needs that message afresh today.。
I wanna pray for these brothers and sisters, Lord,。
and those that are watching online right now,。
that they would know the power of your peace.。
Lord, I pray that if there's anything that's going on。
in the lives of these people,。
in the lives of us as a community here at the Vine,。
that is keeping us in a place of stress, anxiety, fear,。
a place where we don't feel at peace.。
Lord, we come to you this morning,。
and we ask for your presence again.。
Emmanuel, I pray that you would be with us,。
that you would draw near to those。
that do not feel at peace right now.。
And Lord, I'm sure each one of us, we have relationships,。
we have things that feel tense and stressy at the moment.。
Father, we just bring them to you now in prayer.。
And we ask that you would come and carry our burdens with us,。
lighten our load,。
and that those of us whose tongues feel like。
they've been stilled within us。
would feel our tongues being loosened again.。
Those of us that have walked away from relationships。
like the shepherd would at Christmas time realize。
that there's an invitation for restoration.。
Father, would you come and bring peace on earth。
just as it is in heaven?。
And may it be for your glory.。
And we thank you for this.。
In Jesus' name, Emmanuel says.。
We're gonna worship together one more carol,。
so let's join together in song.。
