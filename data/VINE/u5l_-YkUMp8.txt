When she was talking about having passion and all of that,。
I really admire her passion for workout as well.。
She loves exercise and she would, you know, go on workouts.。
While I struggle to go on workout once every three months,。
I join the gym next door.。
But I have promised myself that I will go after VBS.。
And then my next statement was,。
I'll go after I preach this Sunday.。
Hopefully tomorrow I'll bring you good news that I will go.。
Right?。
I don't have the motivation to get changed into my work。
workout clothes.。
And I really need that empowerment,。
that motivation, as you can say.。
And I think that when I,。
and reminds me of my younger days,。
when I was studying in university,。
I joined a Christian choir and it was one of the wildest。
thing I've ever done up to that point in my life.。
And you go, Christian choir?。
Wild?。
How they go together?。
But if you mix in a bunch of 20 year olds,。
it's a whole different story.。
There was this year when I first joined the committee。
of that Christian choir,。
and I was tasked to do a musical for,。
not only for that university,。
I was in Baptist university, right?。
Not only for the university Baptist choir,。
we had to join another university's Christian choir。
to do something together, to put on a musical together.。
Well, doing a musical on its own is really hard。
because all the garments, all the props,。
look at this, all the choreography, everything.。
You can actually see me there,。
but I hope that you don't see me。
'cause I look really different.。
Everything, you have to do it from scratch.。
And not only that, I have to work with another university.。
What about the scheduling?。
What about the cohesion, you know,。
the communication between the two conductors?。
What are the dynamics like?。
And if you still think this is still tame, listen,。
I have to do this without WhatsApp.。
There's no WhatsApp group, there's no AI, there's nothing.。
Okay, so I often tell my K4C class, I'm really old,。
I'm like 84, because I remember the first year。
I was in university, I'm really embarrassed to say this,。
I have to hand in my homework through a floppy disk.。
For those of you that don't know what a floppy disk is,。
it is that little icon on the Word document。
where you wanna push save,。
and you see this weird square, right?。
That weird square was a floppy disk.。
It was from the ancient day, and I have to,。
you can only save around two to three documents。
in a floppy disk.。
So it was really fun.。
It was fun to have, you know,。
a production using just word of mouth,。
just call, just trust that person.。
When I schedule something, you will be there.。
I couldn't double confirm you through my WhatsApp, right?。
If you don't show up, I don't know how to contact you.。
And I so vividly remember how overwhelmed I was。
when in the meeting,。
when I was tasked with this responsibility.。
How could I possibly handle everything?。
It was my first time being in a committee member,。
and now you're telling me that I need to run。
this whole thing.。
They have chosen the wrong person.。
They have made a huge mistake.。
But that's the thing.。
Jesus gives every one of his volunteer a task。
that can feel just like that daunting sometimes.。
In Acts 1.8, right before Jesus ascended to heaven,。
Jesus said, "You will receive power。
"when the Holy Spirit come on you,。
"and you will be my witness in Jerusalem,。
"and in all Judea and Samaria,。
"and to the ends of the world."。
Can you imagine how overwhelming it is。
for the first disciples?。
The small, ordinary group of men and women。
were told to bring the message of Jesus to the whole world.。
No social media, no microphones, no Bible app,。
just their voices, their stories,。
and the promise of God's power.。
And honestly, that could feel overwhelming for us too.。
For many of us, it's not easy or natural。
to talk about our faith,。
especially with people close to us.。
Maybe you feel nervous to bring up Jesus in your family。
because you don't wanna cause tension。
or to be misunderstood.。
Maybe you feel awkward sharing your faith with friends,。
worrying that what they will think about you,。
maybe they think that you're very pushy, maybe at work.。
You wonder if it's even possible or wise。
to share what you believe.。
Our series of Uncharted。
led us to examine the unchartedness of our early churches。
and the season our church is in.。
Just like those first believers,。
we are finding ourselves stepping into territory。
we have never been before,。
facing new challenges, new opportunities,。
and sometimes new fears.。
The early churches didn't have a step-by-step manual。
for what to do next.。
They were called to trust God。
and they have to follow the Spirit's leading。
and to share the message of Jesus in places and ways。
that was unfamiliar and even risky.。
In the same way as a church family,。
we are navigating our own uncharted waters.。
Maybe we're starting a new ministry,。
reaching out to new people,。
or simply learning to trust God in our journey.。
In situations where we feel uncertain or overwhelming,。
just like the early disciples,。
we might feel small, unprepared,。
unsure of how to move forward.。
But the good news is we are not alone.。
In the first week, our elder Deborah shared with us。
about what it means to wait in active faith.。
Waiting isn't just about sitting around doing nothing.。
It's a posture of hope and expectation.。
The early believers didn't wait passively.。
They trusted in Jesus' promise and the Holy Spirit。
and their waiting was filled with purpose.。
And then last week,。
Pastor John spoke about what it means to,。
to remember the word, receive, thank you,。
to what it means to receive.。
The waiting was finally over.。
Through Christ, God sent us the Holy Spirit,。
not just to gather in the upper room,。
but as a gift for everyone,。
men and women, young and old,。
people from every nation.。
It's a gift for all.。
And today, we're gonna talk about what it means。
to be empowered by the Holy Spirit.。
As the theologian, Gordon Fee, has said,。
"The gift of the Spirit is not given。
"so that believers may enjoy。
"a private spiritual experience,。
"but so that they may participate。
"in the life and mission of the church。
"as the new people of God."。
There is a purpose and mission behind this gift.。
There is a purpose and mission behind this gift.。
The Holy Spirit empowers us。
for what God is calling us to do.。
We're not left alone to face this daunting task.。
We are empowered together by the Spirit。
to live out God's mission in the world.。
But what is our mission?。
As Acts 1.8 says, before Jesus ascended to heaven,。
He said, "You will, we will be His witness in Jerusalem。
"and in all Judea and Samaria,。
"and to the ends of the world."。
It was clear that the mission to the disciples。
was to be Christ's witnesses,。
not just in Jerusalem, but till the end of the world.。
But this mission wasn't just for them back then.。
It was for us too.。
We are called to be Christ's witness today。
in our home, in our workplaces.。
But what is a mission?。
What does being a witness mean?。
When I was younger, I attended a local church。
where every few months, all the community groups,。
everyone would go out to hand out gospel tracts.。
Do you know what are gospel tracts?。
There they are.。
They are small pamphlets that explain what the gospel is,。
usually with a simple story.。
It's very in your face, right?。
They explain what the gospel is,。
usually with a short story or Bible verse.。
We would stand around the parks and bus stops。
and wait for people.。
Imagine that you were given out a bunch of these。
and you have to stand around bus stops.。
And then when the people get off the bus。
from work or whatever, we have to go,。
"Hi, I'm June.。
"I'm one of the Christians around this area.。
"Have you heard of Jesus yet?"。
That, to an introvert, is so cringey。
that every time they made me go,。
I'll be like, "I don't feel well today.。
"I cannot go today.。
"This is going to be so cringey。
"if I have to walk up to someone sitting,。
"enjoying their sunny afternoon."。
And I go, "Hi."。
So creepy.。
But when I told my pastors back then,。
she would say, "Oh, but you should not be ashamed。
"of the gospel.。
"You need to be the witness."。
Is that what being a witness is?。
I wonder at that time.。
Later, during my university years,。
the pressure looked a little different.。
Remember, I was organizing the musical in my second year?。
I was also motivated by my peers,。
not by my parents, by my classmates,。
to have a high GPA.。
That means like the annual average score。
for that year, right?。
And because that is the way to be a good witness。
to my friends and family.。
Do you know what my GPA was。
in the first year, first semester?。
Generally, people get 3.5。
because it is the easiest semester。
and everyone wants to get a high one。
so that by the end of the third year,。
they have something to sit on, right?。
Everyone gets around 3.5 or something.。
I also got a three.。
I got a 2.3.。
That was really, really bad.。
Honestly, and so,。
but the pressure motivates me.。
Not only the pressure motivates me,。
I actually have a friend, my classmate,。
who's also my dormitory flatmate.。
She would get up at five o'clock。
in the morning to study.。
As a university student,。
I didn't get up at five.。
I tried to, but that motivate me.。
So actually, I raised my GPA。
from 2.3 to 3.1.。
And over that time,。
I realized that I was reducing。
to being a witness,。
to just having good behaviors。
or impressive achievements.。
That mindset brought a lot of pressure.。
I felt like I constantly had to live up。
to some perfect Christian standards.。
And when I inevitably fall short,。
it left me with a sense of shame and guilt.。
But the most difficult place to be a witness,。
for me, has always been at home.。
My parents, more than anyone, know my flaws.。
My laziness, my procrastination,。
and those rebellious moments.。
Trying to be witness in my own family。
has often felt impossible。
because they see the real me。
and not the church me.。
If I'm honest,。
sharing my faith at home。
is the most difficult.。
So what is being a witness?。
In the ancient world,。
a herald was a messenger。
sent from the battlefield.。
Imagine a city full of anxious people。
waiting to hear who had won the war.。
And then the herald finally arrived。
and shouted the good news,。
the victory, to these people。
and everything changed.。
The whole city rejoiced.。
The future looked different.。
The Greek word for this word,。
this joyful announcement,。
is called euangelion.。
The same word we use for gospel。
or the good news.。
This is the picture。
that the first Christian used。
when they talked about Jesus.。
They believed that through his death。
and resurrection,。
Jesus had already won。
the ultimate victory。
over sin, death, and evil.。
The victory is real.。
It has already happened.。
But just like history,。
imagine World War II, right?。
For example,。
even after the enemy。
was defeated in their homeland,。
many places still lived under occupation.。
The news of the victory has arrived,。
but the effects hadn't reached。
every corner yet.。
People in those places。
lived in the in-betweens.。
They knew victory was won,。
but the old powers。
were still in the present for a time.。
And that's the world we live in.。
That's the world we live in.。
We've heard the good news。
that Jesus has won,。
but we still live and experience pain,。
suffering, and injustice.。
The effects of his victory。
are not fully here yet.。
We live in this tension,。
this already but not yet tension.。
So what does it mean。
to be a witness in Christ?。
It means being like the herald。
who brings the news of victory.。
It means living, speaking,。
and making choices in ways。
that show people。
Jesus has already won.。
Even while we wait for the fullness。
of his victory to come,。
our lives become signals to the world。
that a new reality has begun.。
Even in a world that hasn't yet seen。
the final peace,。
we live as a people。
who know that the outcome is secure.。
And how can we do something。
that seems impossible?。
That seems impossible, right?。
We are living in this injustice.。
We're experiencing pain and suffering,。
and we have to show people that,。
no, the victory is done.。
We are set free from our sin.。
We are set free from our pain.。
There can be justice in this place,。
but I don't see it yet.。
Nor my friends have seen it yet,。
but I have to live and speak。
and make decisions and choose。
as if the final victory。
is here already.。
How can we do something。
that seems near impossible?。
But before the commission,。
there was the promise.。
You will receive power。
when the Holy Spirit comes on you.。
You will receive power.。
We are empowered by the Holy Spirit。
to live out this command.。
We're not doing this。
out of our own strength,。
nor we should be.。
We have access to the Holy Spirit,。
who is our ever-present help.。
We are empowered.。
Peter's life and his sermon。
after Pentecost is a demonstration。
of how the Spirit empowers us。
for this mission.。
Just look at, can you recall。
some of what Peter has gone through。
before the Pentecost,。
before Jesus died?。
He boldly walked on water。
for a moment,。
and then sank in fear.。
He tried to defend Jesus。
by cutting off soldiers' ear,。
acting impulsively.。
Most painfully,。
he denied even knowing Jesus。
three times.。
In all of these moments,。
Peter's action was driven。
by what you called。
self-reliance zeal.。
This means that he was relying。
mostly on his own energy,。
his own ideas of what should be done,。
and his own desire。
to prove his loyalty to Jesus.。
It was courage fueled。
by his own effort,。
by trying harder,。
by pushing forward,。
by reacting in the moment.。
But no matter how sincere he was,。
it wasn't enough.。
His courage kept running out。
when the pressure was on.。
Peter was passionate.。
He wanted to be faithful,。
but over and over again,。
he found himself falling short,。
sinking, falling,。
acting out of fear or confusion.。
He was just like us,。
full of good intention,。
but often lacking the strength。
to follow through.。
Don't know if you've ever felt that way.。
We wanted to do something good。
for people, to serve them,。
but accidentally,。
not of our own choosing.。
We hurt them by forcing our thoughts。
and ideas over them,。
by questioning them too hard.。
That was absolutely me.。
When I was younger,。
in my university year,。
I had a friend who is like Eeyore。
in Winnie the Pooh.。
I know, I know.。
I feel so sorry for him too.。
Like, he is a Christian.。
We have been together in the church。
for many years,。
and he would come and say,。
"Hi."。
And I go,。
"What do you like?。
You know, you don't have to."。
Also, he served in church a lot.。
He is in the production team.。
He also lead worship.。
He also do a lot of stuff,。
but he just felt so broken。
and so tired all the time,。
and nothing brings him joy.。
In my heart, I really want him。
to be joyful.。
I believe that as you're a Christian,。
you should be,。
you can be joyful.。
This is the life that Jesus。
has given to us.。
That was my intention.。
But at the end of the day,。
he go, "June, can you not ask me。
any more questions?。
Can you just stay away from me。
for a while?。
You are pushing me too hard."。
And I realized that no matter。
how good my intention is,。
I was hurting him.。
I was pushing my idea。
of what a Christian look like。
onto him.。
It was good intention,。
but falling short.。
But then we see Peter。
after Pentecost.。
In Acts 2.25,。
we see that Peter was not alone.。
He was filled with the Holy Spirit.。
Peter stands in front。
of a huge crowd。
and preached by citing Psalm 16.。
He says,。
"David said about him,。
'I saw the Lord was always。
before me,。
because he is at my right hand.。
I will not be shaken.。
Therefore, my heart is glad。
and my tongue rejoices.。
My body will also rest in hope,。
because you will not abandon me。
to the realm of the dead.。
You will not let your Holy One。
see decay.'"。
Here is what Peter is doing.。
He's looking back at what。
King David wrote in the Psalms,。
and he realized David。
wasn't just talking about himself.。
David was pointing forward。
to someone greater,。
the true Holy One,。
who would not stay dead,。
who would rise again.。
Peter saw that Jesus。
is the only one that truly fits。
what David describes.。
Jesus is the Holy One。
who died but did not see decay,。
because God raised him。
from the dead.。
Peter's sermon at Pentecost。
wasn't about condemning。
or passing judgment,。
telling them off that,。
"You should have known。
the Bible said so clearly."。
He wasn't judging them。
for not knowing.。
No, Peter was one of them.。
He was a Jew who had grown up。
with the same hopes。
and same dreams,。
waiting for God's promise。
to be fulfilled.。
Just like everyone who listens。
to him that day,。
Peter had wondered,。
"When will the Messiah come?。
Who is going to fulfill。
all that God promised。
to King David?"。
His heart was full。
of the same longing,。
the same question。
as the people gathered around him.。
But now,。
filled with the Holy Spirit,。
Peter boldly announces。
that the answer to those hopes。
and those dreams is Jesus,。
the Son of God,。
the true descendant of David,。
and the long-awaited Messiah.。
Peter's message。
was deeply personal.。
He wasn't delivering。
cold theology.。
He was sharing。
the fulfillment。
of his people's greatest hope.。
He stood not as an outsider,。
but a fellow seeker。
whose eyes had been opened。
by God's grace.。
This is what it means。
to be a witness.。
To be a witness。
is not simply to declare facts。
or argue people into believing.。
It is much more than that.。
Being a witness,。
as Peter shows us,。
means stepping into the world。
of the people we are speaking to,。
understanding their fears,。
their hopes,。
and their deepest question.。
It means that allowing。
the Holy Spirit to fill us。
so that our words come out。
not from pride or distance,。
but from genuine compassion。
and shared humanity.。
For us today,。
being witness of Jesus。
is more than just sharing a message.。
It is about living it out.。
It looks like really listening。
to the people around us,。
our friends, our colleagues,。
our classmates,。
getting to know their stories。
and looking for ways。
to connect them,。
their questions and struggles。
to the hope we have found in Jesus.。
It is living with humility。
and being real.。
It's not about acting。
as we have got it all together。
or that we're better than others。
so that we can tell you。
about who Jesus is,。
but being honest。
as people who have found hope。
and healing in Jesus。
and want to share that with others.。
Peter was not alone.。
The Holy Spirit empowered Peter。
to see the hearts of the people,。
to see the hearts of what the people need。
so that he could give them。
the hope that they need.。
We are empowered by the Holy Spirit。
to do the same.。
When our colleagues annoyed us,。
you have a colleague in mind,。
when our colleagues annoyed us,。
instead of our usual frustration,。
we're empowered by the Holy Spirit。
to understand.。
It doesn't mean that we have to go suffer。
and go, "Yeah, you annoyed us.。
Let me just suffer."。
But we are empowered。
by the Holy Spirit to understand.。
When our friends shared。
about their problems,。
we are empowered by the Holy Spirit。
to direct them to the hope。
that Jesus has for him or her.。
What is really amazing about Peter。
is that he was just。
an ordinary fisherman.。
He wasn't known for being。
a great speaker.。
In fact, before Pentecost,。
Peter was often impulsive.。
He made a lot of mistakes,。
and sometimes he was even scared。
to admit that he knew Jesus.。
But once the Holy Spirit came,。
everything changed.。
The same is true for us.。
We may feel inadequate, unqualified,。
or unsure of what to say.。
Yet, this is not in our own strength。
or eloquence that matters.。
Whether we are making。
godly decisions at work,。
befriending someone who feels。
left out at school,。
or choosing to communicate。
with love and patience at home,。
these are all visible expressions。
of our inner conviction。
that Jesus reigns.。
Each act of faith,。
each moment of kindness,。
reflects our trust。
that Jesus has already won。
and victory over sin。
and that by His Spirit,。
we can live differently.。
It is not out of our own strength。
that we can go and force。
ourselves to be kind。
and force ourselves to do more.。
It is the Holy Spirit。
that is with us。
so that we're able to understand。
and we want to choose。
to live differently。
because we are empowered。
by the Holy Spirit.。
Moreover, Peter's courage。
wasn't something he drummed up。
from within himself.。
He didn't suddenly become eloquent。
because he tried harder。
or studied more.。
Instead, the Spirit filled him,。
gave him the words,。
and gave him the insight。
from God's Word.。
So much so that when he spoke,。
his message could cut straight。
to the hearts of the listener.。
The Spirit empowered Peter。
to be bold through his revelation。
in his word.。
Look at Acts 2, 22-23.。
Fellow Israelites, listen to this.。
Jesus of Nazareth。
was a man accredited by God。
to you by miracles,。
wonders, and signs,。
which God did among you through him.。
As you yourself know,。
this man was handed over to you。
by God's deliberate plan。
and foreknowledge,。
and you, with the help of wicked men,。
put him to death。
by nailing him to the cross.。
In just a few words,。
Peter brings together two big truths。
about the cross,。
truths that are both comforting。
and challenging.。
First, Peter wants everyone to know。
that Jesus' death was not a plan B.。
It was not an accident.。
The cross, like things,。
it's not like things got out of control。
or maybe it's God's original plan backfired。
so he had to come up with a backup.。
No, it may look that way,。
may look that way,。
especially when you see Jesus being betrayed,。
arrested, and nailed to a cross.。
From the outside,。
it might seem like everything went wrong,。
like evil and chaos won that day.。
But Peter made it clear,。
this was never plan B.。
Jesus' death was not a surprise to God。
or a mistake in the story.。
Peter says Jesus was handed over。
by God's deliberate plan。
and foreknowledge.。
That means God already know exactly。
what he was doing all along.。
The cross wasn't God's scrambling fix to a problem.。
It was always the plan to save us.。
What looked like the defeat。
was actually God working out his greatest victory,。
even in the darkest moment.。
God was in control,。
turning the very thing that would have,。
turning it into the very thing。
that would have rescued us.。
But Peter wouldn't let the crowd off the hook.。
He said, "And you,。
"with the help of the wicked man,。
"put him to death."。
So yes, it was God's plan,。
but it was also human sin。
that nailed Jesus to the cross.。
It was jealousy, fear,。
rejection that led to his crucifixion.。
The religious leaders schemed,。
the crowd shouted,。
the Roman soldiers carried it out.。
And yet, even though God used their actions for good,。
they were still responsible for what they did.。
God's plan doesn't excuse our guilt.。
God's sovereignty and our responsibility go hand in hand,。
and we can't always explain how that works,。
but both are true.。
Now, here's where the Holy Spirit comes in.。
As Peter is preaching,。
it is not just a history lesson or theology lecture.。
The Holy Spirit is at work.。
His empowerment is at work,。
taking those words and pressing them。
right into people's hearts.。
In Acts 2, 37, it says,。
"When the people heard this,。
"they were cut to the heart."。
It was not just about knowing it was my responsibility.。
It was something that actually were impressed in their heart,。
and they felt for it, they felt about it.。
They have a feeling to it,。
and that's what the Spirit does.。
He brings clarity into,。
clarity about who Jesus is,。
and conviction about where we stand with God.。
It's like the lights come on,。
and suddenly it's personal.。
The crowd didn't just understand the message,。
they felt it.。
They realized that the need for Jesus,。
and cried out, "Brothers, what shall we do?"。
It was this moment of the Holy Spirit in you。
that brings clarity into our heart.。
And when we sit, and when we are reading the Bible,。
when we are praying, when we are interacting with people,。
when we are listening in the sermon,。
the Holy Spirit is in work, in us,。
bringing us conviction,。
and we shout to God, "Oh no, I've sinned against you.。
"What shall we do?"。
When you think back to the moment。
you first put up your hand to receive Jesus,。
or the time you felt deeply。
that something in your life needed to change,。
that wasn't your reasoning or your emotions at work.。
It was the Holy Spirit inside you,。
moving you, bringing conviction into your heart.。
It's not a conviction to shame you or to guilt you,。
as if you're letting God down if you don't get it right.。
Rather, it is a conviction。
that wakes you up to the reality of God's love。
and beauty of what Jesus has done for you.。
The Spirit doesn't just simply point out what's wrong.。
He draws us towards what is right.。
He opens our eyes to see Jesus more clearly,。
and moves us to turn away from old patterns。
and step into a new way of living.。
This is conviction that comes not from fear or punishment,。
but from hope.。
Hope that change is possible, that forgiveness is real,。
and that Jesus welcomes us into this new life.。
So when you feel this gentle nudge to turn from old habits,。
to embrace something new that God is calling you to,。
recognize that it is the Spirit's loving work,。
drawing you closer to Jesus and making you more like Him,。
not by your own strength,。
but by His empowering presence within you.。
We are not left alone.。
We are not left alone.。
The Holy Spirit empowers us to be witnesses,。
not in extraordinary moments,。
but in the ordinary, everyday rhythm of life.。
This is what makes our witness undeniable.。
It is not about having it all together,。
but about letting the reality of Jesus。
shine through our real transformed lives.。
The world can't ignore a life changed by God.。
The world can't ignore you being changed by God.。
The world cannot ignore the fact that in the old you,。
the past you, you will feel agitated,。
you will be angry, you will react in an impulsive way.。
But then in that moment, you chose to quiet down.。
The world cannot ignore that.。
The world cannot ignore the fact that。
I should make this decision at work。
because everyone is doing the same,。
but then you chose differently.。
That decision, that turn,。
your colleagues cannot ignore that.。
Your classmate cannot ignore the fact that。
when you go into the classroom,。
you speak to those that were being ignored.。
Your family members cannot ignore the fact that。
usually when they shouted at you,。
when they talk mean things about you,。
you would slam the door.。
They cannot ignore the fact that you chose to listen.。
We do not need to do anything great,。
but in our every moment, in our every decision,。
we choose Jesus because He has won.。
He has freed us from comparison.。
He has freed us from self-centeredness.。
We can embrace this new life and this new hope.。
And if you have not received it yet,。
you do not need to be guilt-tripped by doing this.。
It is not something that we will judge,。
oh, you're not doing that.。
That was a Christian.。
No.。
Before the commission, there was this promise.。
Before you need to do the action,。
remember you receive this new life first.。
You receive this grace that God has given you first.。
You receive it first, and then you be witness。
of what the grace, the love, the freedom。
that you have received to show people。
in your family, in your workplace, and in your home.。
We may feel ordinary.。
We may feel unprepared.。
But God delights in using ordinary people,。
people just like me and you, maybe,。
to carry out His extraordinary mission.。
He doesn't ask us to do it alone。
or to muster up our own strength。
or to pretend we've had it all together.。
He simply asks us to trust Him,。
to seek His presence in His word。
and in our quiet time with Him,。
to receive His Spirit, to receive His grace,。
and to take the next step as witness right where we are.。
What if we truly believe that the Spirit is with us。
in every conversation?。
What if we believe that the Holy Spirit。
will empower us in every act of kindness,。
every moment when we choose to love,。
to forgive or to speak up for what is right?。
What if, as a church, we lean in together,。
allowing the Holy Spirit to transform our weaknesses。
into testimonies, our failures into stories of God's grace。
and our everyday lives into evidence that Jesus is alive?。
Let's be the people where others see more。
than just good intentions or nice program.。
Let's be a people who live so honestly with such hope。
that those around us can't help。
but see the reality of Jesus in us.。
Let our lives be undeniable proof。
that Jesus' victory is real,。
that His Holy Spirit really does change everything.。
You are called, you are empowered, and you are sent.。
And I don't know where you are at with Jesus right now.。
Maybe at this moment, if you ask yourself, you go,。
actually, I don't have a relationship with Jesus.。
That was the prayer I prayed at home, in the bathroom,。
a few weeks after my father passed away.。
I was a Christian for most of my life。
because my grandma was a Christian.。
She made every single one of her sons。
and in-laws to go to church.。
I also went to church when I was really young.。
But when my father passed away,。
it forced me to ask this question,。
God, are you there for me?。
And it made me realize that I don't really。
have a relationship with Jesus.。
I know a lot about Him,。
but I don't have a relationship with Him.。
And today, if you have to be honest with yourself,。
do you feel you have a relationship with Jesus?。
So right now, I would like the worship team to come up。
and I would like to give a moment for you。
to reflect on this.。
And just to be honest, God is a loving God.。
He knows it already, but there is power。
when we bring things into the light.。
Maybe at this moment, you do not have。
a relationship with Jesus, but He is calling you.。
So with every eyes closed right now,。
with every head bow,。
I would like you to speak to Jesus.。
He loves you.。
And He wants to.。
And He wants you to be honest with Him.。
And in this moment, if you know that you may not。
have a relationship with Him, but you want to,。
you want to receive this grace,。
you want to receive this love,。
you want to receive this abundant life that He promised,。
and you want to turn away from the old way of life。
because that has not been working out for you.。
You have tried, you have used your own effort,。
your own way of living, and it did not work.。
You were hurting yourself, you were hurting people。
around you, and you did not have a relationship with Jesus.。
I'd like you, just at your seat,。
that you want to receive this Jesus in your life。
to put up your hand.。
(gentle music)。
He loves you, and He waits for you in every single moment.。
I see that hand, thank you.。
Maybe you are a Christian,。
but you have not been relying。
on the Holy Spirit's empowerment.。
You have all the good intentions,。
but when you're trying to show people that Jesus lives,。
you fell short.。
I want to pray for you.。
If you are one of those people that you want to be empowered。
by the Holy Spirit today to live out the victorious life,。
the reality that Jesus is alive,。
I would like you to open up your hand。
and to receive this Holy Spirit that empowers you。
to live victoriously, to live differently.。
Jesus, we thank you, because today,。
someone here has made a decision to follow you.。
I pray that by your grace and your power,。
that you are going to fill him up with the Holy Spirit。
to empower him to turn from his old ways and to run to you.。
I pray that as he make his decision to receive you,。
that you will give him and honor him。
and know that you will give him an abundant life.。
Thank you for dying for us on the cross.。
Thank you for forgiving our sin.。
Today, we turn away from our past way of life。
and to turn to you, Jesus, and we thank you.。
For this new life that is ahead of the people,。
and we pray in Jesus' name, amen.。
And I pray for the people。
who also wants to be empowered by the Holy Spirit today。
to live a life of victorious life,。
that in every single moment,。
that we are going to know the presence。
of the Holy Spirit with us.。
In our action, in our speech, in our decision,。
your empowerment is real.。
Your presence is undeniable.。
And today, we're going to learn to seek you.。
We'll learn to be with you in all that we do.。
And we are thankful for that.。
And in Jesus' name we pray, amen.。
