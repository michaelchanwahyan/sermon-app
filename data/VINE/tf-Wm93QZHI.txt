Thank you, Justin.。
That was amazing.。
It's good to be with you this morning on this little cooler morning.。
I am a Hong Konger.。
Hong Kong is Sandra and I's adopted home and has been for the last 37 years.。
Its people are my family.。
My sons, their wives, and five grandchildren are also Hong Kongers.。
The grandchildren were all made in Hong Kong, well, to my knowledge anyway.。
They were born here, of that I can be sure.。
Don't be put off by my face.。
Yes, I am a guai lou.。
Don't be put off by my lack of Chinese.。
I don't speak Cantonese.。
Well, to be truthful, I speak a little Cantonese.。
I love Hong Kong.。
Tim told us last week that it doesn't matter whether we are an expat, a local, a domestic。
helper, or an asylum seeker.。
It doesn't matter whether we are a street sleeper or we're chairman of HSBC.。
This is home.。
And Tim used a famous passage in Jeremiah 29 to tell us.。
Yes, as he said, it does contain the famous 2911 fridge magnet bookmark photo frame verse.。
To seek the peace and prosperity of the city.。
He reminded us that this word of God was given to a people in exile.。
The Israelites who spent 70 years, yes, 70 years as strangers and aliens in Babylon.。
Tim used this to challenge us to become engaged in our city.。
But there was no excuse for apathetic disengagement.。
But if that was the what, today I want to look at the how.。
How can I as an expat, a domestic helper, asylum seeker, street sleeper, or chairman。
of HSBC, how can I as a member of Vine, Yuen Long, contribute, contribute to the peace。
and prosperity of our city?。
You see, whereas in the first message we looked at how we relate to Hong Kong and Yuen Long。
from a big picture perspective, this time we want to look in more detail.。
What does it actually mean to love the place we're in and to work for its welfare and peace?。
More especially, how can we use the church's resources, our faith resources to bring flourishing。
to Yuen Long?。
How can we use our difference to serve people?。
Today we will think about our spheres of influence and how we can contribute to the flourishing。
and well-being of Yuen Long and its people so that people will see our good work and。
praise God in heaven.。
And I'll tell you something.。
I'm going to make it simple.。
So embarrassingly simple.。
To demonstrate, I'm turning to two household items.。
They're actually all in this one thing.。
How can you talk about salt and light and have it in one thing?。
Look at that.。
Salt and light.。
Press it again.。
Yes.。
Salt and light.。
It's for you, Byron.。
Let's look at scripture.。
Let's turn to Matthew 5.。
Let's start at verse 13.。
You.。
Yes, you.。
You.。
Yes, you.。
You are the salt of the earth.。
But if salt's lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored?。
It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's。
feet.。
You are the light of the world.。
A city set on a hill cannot be hidden, nor do people light a lamp and put it under a。
basket but on a stand so it gives light to all the house.。
In the same way, let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works。
and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.。
Let me start by giving you some background.。
This section is from the Sermon on the Mount.。
Matthew 5, 6, 7.。
Amazing chapters.。
Jesus' audiences were the disciples of Jesus and the crowd who were the future disciples。
of Jesus.。
And what they were doing, they were weighing the cost of following Jesus.。
And the background to my teaching this morning can be found in Jesus' teaching in the Sermon。
on the Mount.。
And particularly his teaching on the Kingdom of God also described as the Kingdom of Heaven.。
Jesus had told them in Matthew 4 that repentance is the key to entering the Kingdom of Heaven.。
I've put it on the screen.。
From that time, Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."。
As the Sermon on the Mount continues, Jesus answers the important question, "Who can enter。
the Kingdom of Heaven?。
Who can enter the Kingdom of God?"。
He answers it with what we call the Beatitudes.。
I heard that Billy Graham had actually called them "beautiful attitudes."。
I love that.。
I heard a story of a Chinese Christian who came to a missionary one time and said, "I've。
learned to quote the Sermon on the Mount by memory."。
He stood before the missionary and perfectly quoted the sermon word for word.。
The missionary said, "That's wonderful.。
How did you do it?"。
The Chinese Christian said this, "I spent the last year trying to live it."。
Matthew 5, 3 to 6 tells us, "It is the poor and spirit, those who mourn, the meek, those。
who hunger and thirst for righteousness who can enter the Kingdom of God."。
In verses 7 to 9, he then describes the attitude of a Kingdom person as merciful, pure in heart,。
a peacemaker.。
We are told we will be called children of God.。
All this seems good.。
But Matthew 5, 11 tells us how the world, how the world out there treats a Kingdom citizen.。
Jesus said we will be insulted, persecuted, falsely bad-mouthed, but that we will be blessed.。
Jesus then takes it a stage further.。
I put this one on the screen.。
Matthew 5, 12, "Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven.。
For in the same way, they persecuted the prophets who were before you."。
My friends, we are citizens of heaven.。
We are ambassadors of Christ.。
We are heirs of the Kingdom of God.。
That is because of the work of Jesus on the cross and our faith and belief in Jesus.。
And this brings us to our message for today.。
How can I, as a member of Vine, Ewan Long, how can I, as a citizen of heaven, an ambassador。
for Christ, an heir of the Kingdom of God, contribute to the peace and prosperity of。
our city?。
I will tell you in 14 words, you are the salt of the earth.。
You are the light of the world.。
You are salt and light.。
This is about our identity in Jesus.。
It's not about you trying to be something.。
But it's about what you are, what you already are in Jesus and in his Kingdom.。
The beauty of the gospel is that God makes us his people.。
And he gives us a new identity and a new purpose.。
And God calls us to figure out how to work out that identity in the world.。
So our identity is in Christ.。
Christ, who is the salt of the earth and the light of the world.。
And we, in our identity, become that in the world.。
Jesus told his disciples that despite the difficulties, despite the persecution, you。
are to be the salt and light of the world.。
When times are tough, we tend to quit.。
We tend to withdraw into our shell.。
We tend to go into our small community and be self-sufficient.。
Jesus said no.。
The citizens of my Kingdom have an important role to play in this world.。
Contributing to the peace of our city.。
Even in a world where there can be things that are against our principles and ethics.。
Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to be like salt and light in the world.。
So let's see this passage in two parts.。
The first one is salt.。
I repeat Matthew 13.。
You are the salt of the earth.。
But if salt has lost its taste, how should its saltiness be restored?。
It's no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's。
feet.。
You are the salt of the earth.。
The first metaphor that Jesus uses for our connection with the world or our engagement。
with the world is that we are to be salt.。
Salt has been used by humanity for over 6,000 years.。
What was the idea of salt in the thinking of the ancient world?。
Well, salt was a very valuable commodity in the ancient world.。
It was like money.。
There are records that sometimes in some places, Roman soldiers might receive their pay, their。
wages, their salary in salt.。
That's where the word salary comes from, see?。
Salt.。
You go to a pay table and they give you a little pouch with a salt.。
That's how valuable and sellable salt was in the ancient world.。
I can think of three major uses of salt.。
For as a preservative agent, as a flavoring agent, and as a healing agent.。
Let's take them one at a time.。
Firstly a preserving agent.。
In the ancient world and even today, salt is used to preserve meat.。
Salted meat and fish became a necessity in the day before the refrigerator was invented.。
The refrigerator is only 200 years old, right?。
The very basic way is that you could pack it with salt and dry it up so that you could。
preserve the meat.。
And the idea behind salt is very much about preserving influence.。
Christians are to serve as a preserving influence in the world against decay.。
That's what Jesus is saying to his disciples.。
You are to be like a preservative in the world.。
If the world around you is wicked, arrogant, and sinful, the believers in its midst must。
act like a preservative and make it slow down in its progress to decay.。
We should make the world better.。
There's something distinct about us.。
God's goodness in us protects us against the decay of the world.。
At the cross, Jesus defeated death and the system of the world.。
Now we become a preserving factor for goodness.。
I mean, take a look around you.。
Do you see the growing trend towards dishonesty, corruption, immorality, violence, pornography,。
and the diminishing respect for human life?。
Whose fault is it?。
Let me put it this way.。
If meat goes bad, there's no point in blaming the meat.。
That is what happens when bacteria are allowed to breed unchecked.。
The question to ask is, where is the salt?。
My question to you this morning, where is the salt?。
Salt is also a flavoring agent.。
Salt is used to season our food.。
Some of you, I've seen you.。
You love your salt like anything.。
I see people salt their food before they even taste it, right?。
I'm British, right?。
We love fish and chips.。
But the best bit of fish and chips is actually the salt and the vinegar.。
Of course.。
Salt greatly enhances the flavor of the food.。
We're supposed to be there to make society better.。
The world is supposed to be better because of the fact that the disciples of Jesus are。
in it.。
Sometimes the world doesn't understand that.。
It often persecutes believers.。
My friends, there is no area of your life that Jesus doesn't come into.。
He comes into your personal life, your family life, your professional life, your relationship。
with others, and in all those relationships, you are a preservative against corruption。
of the world.。
You must be a flavoring in your workplace.。
You must be a flavoring in your schools and colleges.。
Christians must be the salt in hospitals and other workplaces.。
But lastly, salt is a healing agent.。
Universally, salt is seen as a healing agent.。
The use of salt and salt water can be traced right the way back to Greeks, Romans, and。
Egyptians, all of whom used it to treat cuts, wounds, and skin irritations.。
Today, thousands of years later, a concentrated form of salt water is called saline, right,。
and is routinely used in medical.。
Saline is sterile.。
Oh, there's so much hurt, you know.。
Distrust in our world today.。
Our world is polarized, right?。
Democrats or Republicans.。
Even here, right?。
Yellows and blues.。
Even in churches, division between Protestants and Catholics.。
Local and international churches.。
Denominations.。
Charismatics and evangelicals.。
Whatever those words mean.。
I want to make a declaration today.。
I'm declaring it over this church.。
I declare that the Vine Yuen Long is a bridge-building community.。
Can I hear amen?。
A terror down of walls.。
God's healing agent.。
Salt.。
We serve as the preserving agent, the flavoring agent, and the healing agent to the world.。
Now, let's move from salt to light.。
It's interesting.。
We are the light of the world.。
Go right to the beginning of your Bible.。
People don't carry Bibles so much these days.。
Go right to the beginning.。
Genesis chapter 1.。
I want my iPhone to say Genesis 1.。
In the beginning.。
All right, first words.。
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.。
Now the earth was formless and empty.。
Darkness was over the surface of the deep.。
And the spirit of God was hovering over the waters.。
And God said, the first thing we see recorded that God said was this.。
Let there be light.。
And there was light.。
And God saw that the light was good.。
And he separated the light from the darkness.。
Can I read some more verses to show you where I'm heading with this?。
2 Corinthians 4.。
6.。
For God said, let your light shine out of darkness.。
Made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory。
displayed in the face of Christ.。
1 John 1.5.。
God is light.。
In him there is no darkness at all.。
And then Jesus in 8.12 said this.。
I am the light of the world.。
One of the seven I am's, right?。
I am the light of the world.。
So God is the light.。
Jesus is the light of the world.。
Now Jesus looks at his followers.。
He looks at you.。
You are the light of the world.。
Jesus is saying just like I shine in the world, now I want you to shine in the world.。
And Matthew 5.14 which we read earlier, you are the light of the world.。
Believers are the light of the world.。
This is hard to imagine.。
Like Jesus said these seven I am's, right?。
But the only I am that he said you are is light.。
Jesus doesn't say hey, Kieran, you're the good shepherd.。
Or you're the way, the truth, and the life.。
But he does say I am the light of the world.。
And he then says you are the light of the world.。
This is a great compliment.。
But also a great responsibility.。
That is a powerful declaration of the individual worth and mission of every believer.。
Can we just stop and reflect on that a moment?。
It's so important.。
Jesus who said I am the light of the world.。
Then says Chapman, you are the light of the world.。
That's a responsibility and a privilege, I tell you.。
Light is visibility and radiance.。
Let's go back on these verses again.。
You are the light of the world.。
A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.。
Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.。
Instead they put it in the stand and it gives light to everyone in the house.。
In the same way, let your light shine before others that they might see your good deeds。
and glorify your father in heaven.。
Just four things in that verse.。
We are the light of the world.。
We are a city on a hill.。
We are to be visible.。
And our visibility is done by action, good deeds.。
To come into the light means to come out of hiding.。
We are to be visible in society with the light of our Lord Jesus Christ.。
The light is the gospel.。
The gospel has to radiate from our lives.。
When your light shines, some will accept and turn to the father, but some will reject us.。
But if we're neutral, something is wrong with our Christian effectiveness.。
Our good deeds must radiate from us.。
What great responsibility has been given to us.。
There is not another light that Jesus is shining in the world.。
You, you are the light of the world.。
Jesus said, I want you to be my light.。
I want you to be my instrument.。
You are like my body, my hands and my mouth and my feet on this earth.。
You are the light of the world.。
And we are called to keep that light burning.。
I mean, think about life in Jesus' time.。
They didn't have any artificial light like we do today, right?。
You know, they had oil lamps.。
You know, every house had an oil lamp.。
And these are the kind of lights that Jesus is talking about.。
You are the light of the world.。
Now, individually, one of these might not be too bright.。
But vine yun long.。
I believe together, together, we can light up the entire area.。
Oil is a biblical symbol of the Holy Spirit.。
We are to be like the wise bridesmaids who。
had their lamps full, full of oil and full of the Holy Spirit,。
rather than the foolish ones.。
But as I draw towards a conclusion,。
I need to ask you a hard question.。
I'm going to be straight with you.。
If we truly wish to contribute to the peace of our city,。
are we living as the sword of the earth。
and the light of the world?。
Or are we living just like the world?。
Living in sin, living in flesh.。
I'm not judging, by the way.。
And the good news is that we can repent and ask for forgiveness.。
But given this chance in 2024, let us commit.。
Let's commit together that the Vine Church, yun long,。
will be holy, will be separated, and be life and salt.。
I will pray for that for us for in a moment.。
And I want to end on a positive note.。
Some things that we can do to be salt and light.。
And the first one is this, share your faith in Christ.。
One of the most powerful evangelism tools you have。
is your personal story of coming to faith in Christ.。
What I was like before, how I met Christ, and the difference。
he's made to my life.。
Now, unbelievers may not be interested in discussing。
Bible verses or spiritual doctrines.。
But they will likely be willing to hear your story.。
Look for a point of connection with your colleague,。
your friend, or neighbor, and share about the difference。
that Christ has made in your life.。
No one can argue with that.。
For the more shy, can I encourage you?。
It's not about preaching.。
Some words which were wrongly attributed。
to Francis of Assisi said preach the gospel。
at all times.。
Use words if necessary.。
My personal story is that I actually。
reached more people for Christ when。
I was in the insurance business than I do as a pastor.。
You see, I spend most of my time now with Christians.。
But I didn't stand on my desk and preach a sermon.。
I didn't give out tracts and text the whole time。
or invite them to church every five minutes.。
No.。
But they knew that my door was always open to them.。
It was the way I treated them.。
The smile.。
Let's have a practice.。
[LAUGHTER]。
The words of encouragement.。
That supportive text or email-- very easy to do, right?。
That offer to pray for them when they were。
going through a tough time.。
It's funny, though.。
Sometimes on the side there, I should say,。
I'll pray for you about that.。
They say, oh, yes, yes, yes.。
And they're thinking I'm going to pray for them。
when I get home.。
And I say, come on, then.。
Let's pray.。
We can all do that.。
Second thing is take your light where it's dark.。
A young girl once consulted with her pastor.。
She said, I can't stick it out any longer.。
I'm the only Christian in my company where I work.。
I get nothing but taunts and sneers.。
It's more than I can stand.。
I'm going to resign.。
The pastor said, will you tell me where lights are placed?。
She said, what's this got to do with it?。
Never mind, the pastor said.。
Answer my question.。
Where are lights placed?。
I suppose, she said, in dark places.。
He said, yes.。
And that's why you have been put in a company。
with such spiritual darkness and where。
there is no other Christian to shine for the Lord.。
The young Christian realized for the first time。
the opportunity that was hers.。
She felt that she could not fail God by allowing。
her light to go out.。
She went back to the factory, to the office,。
with renewed determination to let her light。
shine in a dark corner.。
And before long, she was the means。
of leading nine other girls to the Lord.。
And lastly, shine together as the torch.。
If we were to turn the lights out here today,。
and it was in darkness, and I got my iPhone out and put。
my torch on, that would be light in the darkness,。
but it wouldn't be very powerful.。
If we were all to take our iPhones out and all。
put our torches on--。
sorry, I didn't mean to advertise for Apple.。
If we would take our smartphones out,。
if we would take our smartphones out and all put our torch on,。
it would make a difference.。
That is such a picture.。
What strikes me about Vian Yuen Long。
and why Sandra and I love coming here is this.。
You are a community.。
You are a community.。
And the word unity is a big part of community.。
Let us resolve to shine our torches together.。
That the lights are on at Vian Yuen Long 24/7.。
I'm not talking about Huggs, John Lee building.。
The election bill would be rather pathetic.。
But our lights are on 24/7.。
Let us commit to being salt and light.。
I believe that this is the key to contributing。
to the peace and the prosperity of our city.。
As I close, I believe there will be。
a number of significant shifts.。
I see this prophetically.。
And please weigh this up.。
I see a spiritual earthquake.。
In the natural, as what are called tectonic plates。
interact with each other, energy is。
released as seismic waves causing the ground to shake.。
This is an earthquake.。
I see a spiritual earthquake.。
And in this spiritual earthquake,。
I believe we'll see the following.。
Firstly, we will see service, not selfishness.。
Can I repeat that?。
Service.。
Oh, pastor, I'm leaving the church.。
I'm not getting fed.。
You heard that so many times, right?。
All about me, me, me, me, me.。
Selfishness.。
Service, not selfishness.。
Living our lives for each other and the community at large,。
at the expense of worrying about our own individual needs,。
or even the needs of just our church.。
Philippians 2, 3 says this.。
Be humble.。
Thinking of others as better than ourselves.。
I believe we will see as part of this spiritual earthquake。
a healed community, a healed community,。
to show how ethnic, political, generational separation。
and division can be healed in this community.。
Look at us.。
Just take a look around the church.。
We're a diverse bunch.。
Different races, different color faces, different backgrounds,。
different first languages.。
In a world that is divided, with societies and families becoming。
even more polarized, we can become a major contribution。
in the unity part of our community.。
And lastly, we will be carriers of hope.。
Carriers of hope.。
I mean, just read your newspapers.。
Hope seems nowhere to be found these days.。
Instead of cynicism and despair, we carry real hope,。
even in the midst of disorientation,。
even in the midst of pain in our city.。
Tim called it out last week.。
He stated it clearly.。
Fear.。
Fear has become a giant in our city.。
And its people are gripped by it and are desperately。
lacking in hope, especially our young people.。
Our contribution is hope because of what the Bible describes。
as Christ in you, the hope of glory.。
We are the hope for this city because Christ。
is the hope for our city.。
And we just don't take care of our own tribe.。
We also do work for the peace, the security, the justice,。
and the prosperity of our neighbors,。
loving them in word and deed, whether or not。
they believe the same thing as we believe.。
Vine, you're love.。
I bless you.。
I bless you to be salt and to be light.。
Would you stand up?。
I'd love to pray for you as the band comes back.。
[MUSIC PLAYING]。
Will you just put your hands out in front of you, please?。
This is not a religious thing that we do.。
It's just to say to God, I'm open to what you have.。
I think the word that came pretty early on in there,。
and I've got to deal with it, is repent.。
We're all sinners.。
And before we talk about going out to the world out there。
and doing all these wonderful things,。
let's just come before God.。
Say, Jesus Christ, I believe you're the Son of God.。
Jesus Christ, I believe you died for my sins.。
Jesus, forgive my sins and come into my life。
by your Holy Spirit.。
Lord, I choose today to repent of all my wrongdoings,。
my wrong attitudes, my biases towards people.。
Forgive me, Lord, and use me.。
And Lord, together, Lord, we ask for an anointing。
to be upon this church, a fresh anointing.。
Hong Kong doesn't need another church.。
There are plenty of churches in Hong Kong.。
But Hong Kong and Yuen Long in this area。
needs a church who are willing to be salt and light for him.。
My friend, that's a sacrifice.。
I know when you go home today, yeah,。
say that was a good sermon, it tickles your ear,。
and you get on with life, and you live life as normal.。
Being salt and light means living differently.。
Being salt and light means having different priorities.。
It means treating people differently.。
For some of you, it means looking at your workplace。
colleagues differently, your neighbors.。
Holy Spirit, think of that old song,。
"Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning."。
That's what I want to pray, Lord,。
that you would fill our lamps with oil。
and keep them burning bright for you.。
I confess, Lord, I want to be salt and light,。
but so many times, Lord, I fail you.。
Lord, I pray today that you will help me,。
help me to be salt and light.。
I wonder if you'd just join hands across the congregation.。
I want to pray for us together.。
Just join hands together if we can.。
Because I believe this is something。
we need to pray for collectively.。
Vying Yuen Long is just not to be an alternative place。
to come to on a Sunday morning。
because one shy is too far on the MTR.。
God has ordained this place for a purpose,。
to be salt and light in this community.。
But we have to do this together.。
Join us together, Lord, as your people.。
We pray now for the people of Yuen Long.。
We pray now for the people of Hong Kong.。
Help us collectively, Lord,。
to be used by you and for your glory.。
Holy Spirit.。
And I just see the Holy Spirit just --。
this is like an electric current as we're going around.。
We're joined together.。
Holy Spirit just flowing through us,。
flowing for you onto the person next to you and vice versa.。
Holy Spirit, come.。
Fill me afresh.。
I surrender to you now.。
Use me for your glory, Lord, to be salt and light.。
We pray this, and, Lord, we declare。
that you are the waymaker, the miracle worker.。
Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.。
We pray this.。
[music]。
Start to sing, "You are here moving in this place."。
Come on.。
Let's go straight into worship.。
[music]。
