What an introduction, I'm now so scared.。
But let me also tell you a little bit about myself.。
There are a few things that you might find interesting about me.。
First of all, when I was young, I'm really not good at reading.。
Well, maybe not even not good at, I'm scared of reading English books.。
When I was young, if I see an English book on the floor,。
I will not touch it, because I know that if I touch it,。
I'll be responsible for it.。
That means I'll have to read it, and I'm not reading it.。
So I'll just let the English book lie on the floor peacefully,。
and I'll just detour around it.。
And lucky for me to start teaching English for 10 years in my past 10。
years, so well done, students.。
Another surprising thing about me is that sometimes I。
listen to really loud music to relax.。
I find that the louder and more upbeat the music,。
the more calming it is for me.。
Like, it feels so calm when I just hear music blasting in my ear.。
I don't know, did anyone of that find loud music calming?。
Awesome, good, good.。
Yeah, right?。
Another interesting thing about me, well, my friends find about me。
is that I'm good at connecting with people now.。
I have an ex-colleague/friend who was quite surprised that I can actually。
talk to strangers now when I meet new people.。
Last time she saw me on my IG Reels talking about the friends。
that I met in Australia, and then she met me, and they go, June,。
you made friends in Australia?。
I'm like, yeah.。
And I've been friends with her for over 10 years.。
And I've met her not only--。
not like, oh, I've met her once every five months.。
No, I meet her every single day when we were at work.。
Even though I left the place that we worked together,。
I still meet her like once or twice every week.。
And she still finds me surprising that I can make friends and connect。
with people now.。
Maybe that's because we've been friends for so long。
that we've stopped thinking or knowing about each other.。
We've stopped knowing anything fresh or the small changes。
that happens in us every day.。
We all need fresh encounters in our relationships,。
whether it is with our friends that we've known for a long time,。
our spouse, or even with God.。
Maybe you have been a Christian for a long time,。
and seeking fresh encounter with Jesus is something。
that you've always thought--。
you've always wanted.。
You've known Jesus for a long time, and then the more that you know him,。
the more that you come to church to listen to sermons and read the Bible,。
and you go, yeah.。
Whenever June talked about the five fish and the two loaves,。
I know what she's going to talk about.。
Or you open up the Bible, and you read Psalms 1,。
and you go, I know exactly how this is going to be.。
This is another story that I've learned since I was in kids ministry.。
And you need that fresh encounter, and you just。
don't know how to get it or where to begin.。
I hope that this message speaks to you about how。
to journey through those moments and find fresh encounter with Jesus.。
Maybe you are just a new Christian or not yet a Christian,。
but you have made assumptions with, you know, I think God is like that.。
I've heard that God looks like that, or Jesus is like that.。
And you kind of need someone to tell you who Jesus is through his word.。
And I hope that this message is going to shine some light on you。
to show you a pathway of how I did it when I was young。
and how I do it when I was walking through some ups and downs when。
I connect with the word of God.。
As I was praying for the sermon, I feel that God。
is saying that last week, since last week,。
it is an important week for all of us because we just。
came out of a 21-day fast.。
And in those 21 days, as a church, we fasted。
from things that were distracting us from God, maybe things that we eat,。
maybe thinking about, you know, constantly thinking about what to eat next.。
That's kind of like my life.。
Or maybe you were watching Netflix and you fasted from Netflix。
and you carved out time to be with God, to pray and to read.。
And every day, the church would send out devotionals,。
sharings from people about how they encounter God.。
And there would be scriptures and questions that came out of the sharing.。
And then, wow, every single morning, I just look forward。
to the sharings that I'm going to read and the question that really helped me。
to respond to or think about my life or think about how I start that morning.。
But then last week, I woke up and there's nothing.。
I'm like, "Chapman, where's the sharing?"。
I wanted to text him that.。
I didn't because there's no more sharing from other people telling me how they。
encountered Jesus' life.。
All I have is the scriptures in my hands right now that I have to wrestle with,。
that I have to sit with to encounter Jesus on my own.。
So this week, I hope that as we just came out of the fast, that we're able to,。
still as a church, continue our connection with God, continue our walk with God,。
not from other people's help, not through other people's encounter,。
but our own fresh encounter with Jesus.。
So today, let's begin our fresh encounter with Him through His Word.。
The Word is His revelation to us.。
It is wonderful and precious and a joy to read.。
Should it be?。
Isn't it?。
But that's not how I felt at the very beginning.。
When I first began reading the Bible, I find life's big questions that I can。
give answers to, how I live my life and give me the positive energy that I need。
to live my life.。
But that kind of...that way of describing the Bible kind of threw me off a bit。
because there are two kinds of people.。
There's one kind that can follow instructions really well,。
and there's this one kind that can't.。
I'm definitely the kind that struggles with it.。
Let me tell you, when I first arrived in Australia a few years ago,。
the first task after I put down my luggage in my shared room was to build the。
Ikea bed.。
It was the hardest thing for me to do.。
I was exhausted after my 10-hour red-eye flight.。
And when I opened the manual, I could not, for the life,。
for the sake of my life, put it together.。
I couldn't understand the pictures.。
I mixed up the screw sizes.。
And I just don't think the instructions work at all.。
Can you put the Ikea bed together?。
Like, no, I can't.。
I come from Hong Kong.。
I'm like, "I can't put this together where I'm sleeping tonight."。
And when I read the Bible as the manual or instructions for my life,。
that's how I feel too.。
Often when I turn to the Bible for instructions, I'm already at my。
wits' end.。
I must have been, you know, looking and searching for how to solve my。
life's problem, and reading the Bible is my last resort.。
So I'm probably overwhelmed and sad and exhausted.。
And then when I read the Bible, I feel the instructions are so out of date。
and not related to my current situation.。
Which verse in the Bible tells me if I should accept the job offer?。
How do I make sense of the instructions?。
Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight.。
You know, what does that mean?。
And let alone the boring incidents about how Israel was split into two,。
and the mystical book of the Revelations.。
Because of these obstacles, reading the Bible seemed like a chore.。
I thought to be a good Christian, which I wanted to be a good Christian,。
I have to read the Bible and pray.。
But the struggles and obstacles made it hard for me to even open the Bible.。
The words seemed mundane and boring.。
I felt nothing when I read, and it seems like work.。
All these made it hard for me to connect with the Bible, let alone seeing God。
through it.。
I don't know if you resonate with what I was going through back then.。
Maybe you're just starting the Bible reading journey, and the book seems so。
daunting to you, and you just don't know where to begin.。
I remember when I first got baptized and everyone gave me Bibles,。
and it was this big, and the paper was so thin and so full of words.。
Where do I begin?。
And I vowed, "Okay, I'm going to read through the Bible from, you know,。
the first book to the last book."。
But then I got stuck at Leviticus.。
I just couldn't get out of it.。
I'm like, "I'm sorry."。
Maybe you've been a seasoned Christian, and there are times in your life you felt。
stagnant in your Bible reading, or that the Bible reading has been a habit,。
and you feel like there's no new stories or parables that you have not read.。
You wish to go deeper into your reading.。
You long for a fresh encounter with Jesus through His words.。
And what does it mean to have a fresh encounter with Jesus?。
Because I've known Jesus for 20 or 30-plus years.。
What does it mean to have a fresh encounter with Jesus?。
To have a deeply rooted, evergreen, fruit-producing life like the poet。
described in Psalms 1.。
Let me take you to the book of Luke, to an account that can help us to find。
some answers to our questions.。
So the story is from Luke 24, and here in the story,。
Jesus has just been crucified.。
Now, there are rumors that Jesus was risen from the dead, and a couple on the way。
to Emmaus had a fresh encounter with Jesus.。
Let's have a look at their experience.。
So verse 13, "Now the same day, two of them were going to a village called。
Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.。
They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.。
As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and。
walked along with them, but they were kept from recognizing Him.。
He asked them, 'What are you discussing together as you walk along?'。
They stood still, their faces downcast.。
One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, 'Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem。
who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?'。
'What things?' Jesus asked.。
There were two people on the way to Emmaus.。
We don't know too much about these two people, but there are a few things we know.。
They were among the group of followers of Jesus, and on that day, the day that Mary。
Madeline and other women found out that Jesus had risen, they were walking towards Emmaus.。
They have heard about Jesus was risen, but their reaction was different from what we。
would have expected.。
They've heard from the woman, they've heard from the disciples, but they were still downcast.。
The Bible said they were kept from recognizing Jesus.。
Yes, physically, they were kept from recognizing Him.。
They did not know that the man who was walking towards them, who was talking to them, was。
the Jesus that they were pining for.。
But I doubt if they know who Jesus was before He hung on the cross, that they still don't。
know who He truly is.。
Let's listen to how they described Jesus to Jesus.。
'About Jesus of Nazareth,' they replied, 'He was a prophet, powerful indeed before God。
and all the people.。
And the chief priests, now rulers, handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and they。
crucified Him.。
But we had hoped that He was the one who was going to redeem Israel.'。
They have followed Jesus, they've heard about what He's done.。
Maybe they've even witnessed some of His miracles.。
They had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel.。
However, not only physically they could not recognize Jesus, they probably had the wrong。
idea of Him, that they couldn't recognize Him from who He truly is.。
In the scripture it says, they had hoped that He was the one who would redeem Israel.。
This implies that Jesus' death put a stop to everything.。
He cannot be the Savior of Israel, because who could save Israel if He is now dead?。
Their past knowledge and experience has blocked them away, has blocked them from knowing who。
Jesus is.。
And when things didn't happen according to their plan, they got disappointed, confused,。
and walked away.。
That could be us, couldn't it?。
Maybe we have known Jesus for a while.。
We've read books about Him, listened to sermons about Him, and met with Him back in the day.。
And we thought we had enough information about Him.。
So we have our own experience about Him, and who He is, and what He's going to do.。
And so we pray and ask Him to do things according to our own plan, and our own understanding。
of Him.。
Jesus could have left them alone.。
At the end of the day, they were only two of the followers, out of the many, that had。
the wrong expectation of Him.。
They weren't recorded in the Bible afterwards.。
So Jesus could have just left them alone and gone to some more other impactful followers。
who could do something and change their lives, and so on.。
But yet, Jesus came up to them.。
Jesus knew they needed a fresh encounter of Him, to know Him afresh, regardless of who。
they are and what they can do.。
He met them where they were at, disappointed, confused, overwhelmed.。
He concealed to them who He was, and showed them through Scripture who He really is.。
Because Jesus knew they needed Him to understand His words.。
Let's look at verse 27.。
It says, "And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, He explained to them what was。
said in all the Scriptures concerning Himself."。
Jesus could have met them in other ways.。
He showed Thomas' wounds.。
He cooked fish for Peter.。
But to these two on the road to Emmaus, He opened up the Scriptures to them, showing。
them who He really is.。
He is the one that they have been reading about, but they didn't get.。
He is the one that they were waiting for, that they have missed.。
Maybe they were disappointed that through all those years, even though they have been。
looking meticulously over the Scriptures, looking for signs and wonders and clues about。
Him, but they still didn't get who He is.。
Jesus is telling the couple and to us that He can be found in the Scriptures, that everything。
in the Scriptures point to Him.。
The couple could see it in the past, but now they understand.。
This is a fresh encounter for the couple.。
They probably have been memorizing Scriptures for their whole lives.。
They have been to synagogue week in and week out, asking questions about the Scriptures,。
looking for and waiting for Him as they do.。
But they were never sure about who the Messiah was.。
But now, now it is different.。
Now their minds are opened and they can understand what it truly means.。
How exciting is that?。
No wonder the couple said to each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while He。
talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"。
Weren't our hearts burning within us?。
The revelation of who Jesus is, the Eureka moment where we understand what He is talking。
about sets fire in our hearts.。
Do you remember the time when you were a little kid and you were given a really difficult。
math question and you tried this way and that way and it still didn't work?。
But then suddenly in that moment, you understand how to solve the problem, that joy in your。
heart.。
And maybe there was this one time when you were trying to read and the sentences doesn't。
make sense to you.。
And you go and ask your teacher and she explained to you what's the underlying meaning of the。
story and who actually the story was pointing to.。
And then you had this sudden realization that the story itself has a bigger meaning behind。
it and you go, "Oh, that's what the story means."。
That joy that you have, that Eureka moment that you have, Jesus is telling us that we。
can find the same feeling, the same burning in our hearts through the Scriptures because。
the whole of the Scripture is pointed to Him.。
When the Bible is interpreted in the light of Jesus, inspired by the Holy Spirit, it。
has a remarkable power to speak directly and personally into our lives.。
Like the couple on the Emmaus Road, we will sometimes find our hearts burning within us。
as the Lord reveals Himself to us through the Bible.。
I believe that Jesus wants to do for you precisely what He did for that couple on the Emmaus。
Road.。
His nature hasn't changed.。
Ask and He will draw alongside you just like how He drew alongside them to open the Scriptures。
for you as He did for them until your heart, like theirs, begins to burn.。
The couple on the Emmaus Road draws a beautiful picture of a fresh encounter with Jesus through。
God's words, a fresh revelation of who He is, having Him speak specifically and personally。
to them.。
With that said, there have been so many discouraging moments where I struggle with the Word of。
God that I felt I get nothing out of reading the Bible.。
I felt that God wasn't speaking to me and I didn't get my questions answered.。
I didn't understand what He was trying to say.。
It was then I realized there were too many "I's" in my sentences.。
Just like reading from the IKEA manual, I was trying to get something done from reading。
it.。
I wasn't reading the Bible to get to know Him.。
I read the Bible with my personal agenda.。
Psychology isn't built on getting my way.。
It is about getting to know the other.。
Am I listening to what He's saying on His terms or am I restricting Him to only answer。
to my worries and my questions?。
I've been putting burdens on my Bible reading.。
I put on the burden of wanting to get something out of reading the Bible.。
I put on the burden of forcing myself to understand every single detail and I put on the burden。
that it depends on me to like reading the Bible and if I don't, I fail.。
But all God wants for us is to be with Him, is to sit by His feet, empty-handed, and just。
ask God to speak to us, to challenge us, to surrender to what He wants to do with our。
time.。
Hebrews 4, verse 12 reminds us that the Word of God is alive and active, sharper than any。
double-edged sword.。
It penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow.。
It judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.。
The power of His Word doesn't depend on my intelligence, my preference or maturity.。
It depends on my consistency to be near Him, to give Him the time and space to speak to。
me through His words.。
Let me say that again.。
It depends on my consistency to be near Him.。
Give Him the time and the space to speak to me.。
I remember there was a period of time when I was quite depressed in Australia.。
I cut myself off from friends and I would stay in my room all day and had no motivation。
in life, let alone getting out of bed.。
I did not know what was the matter with me and I just lost all joy.。
My friends were obviously worried and tried to get me out of my shell, but I find that。
stressful and tiring.。
Through those times, I still kept reading the Bible.。
Though my social energy was low, I found the peaceful presence of just reading through。
the Psalms.。
In a time when I don't even know what happened to me or how I could get out of it, the Word。
seems to be washing and cleansing my heart a little bit every day.。
Then one day as I was reading through the Romans, a verse struck me.。
The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and。
peace.。
It was a verse that I've read before, but never has it been highlighted to me that way.。
I felt like it was both comforting and disciplining me at the same time.。
I do have the Spirit in me since it was there.。
It will bring me peace and joy, things that I felt was missing in my life.。
I do not need to look for it, bend over my knees to beg for it.。
It is there for me by the Holy Spirit.。
But have I been governed by the Holy Spirit?。
Have I been letting Him take hold of me and to guide me in my everyday decision?。
Or have I been letting myself go, letting my emotions decide what I think my future。
holds?。
I kept reciting this verse every day in various ways too, writing it out, thinking about it。
as I go to work, thinking about what I've been governed by and what is governed by it。
means.。
And soon things started moving.。
As someone says, "It is blessed to meditate on His Word."。
Writing it and thinking about it in my quiet time is great, but having a phrase to meditate。
on throughout my day helps the Word to take root in my heart.。
Meditate on it, ask questions about it, and wrestle with it, create moments for God to。
speak to me.。
Looking back, I think so much was at work there.。
God highlighting the verse to me, the Holy Spirit working in me, and I placed myself。
under the Word of God to believe in it despite feeling sad and rotten.。
The Word of God is alive and active.。
Since then, Bible reading has changed for me because after that period of time, I know。
that God's Word is effective and it can be activated in my life, whether I understand。
how it works or not, or whether I feel that it is working or not, because it is the Holy。
Spirit who leads me to the truth and opens my mind to understand His Word.。
It does not mean that I don't struggle with connecting with His Word at times, but I learn。
how to journey through it.。
To think about it, no author would write himself into the story.。
Scrooge does not know about Charles Dickens, nor Juliet knows who Shakespeare is, but our。
Heavenly Father reveals Himself to us through the Bible.。
How precious is that?。
Just think about it for a moment.。
God wants us to know Him.。
He wants us to know Him.。
He wants us to know His plans.。
He wants us to know that He loves us and He has a plan for us and He is assuring us that。
there is a way out in our lives.。
He's not testing our knowledge with the Bible.。
He's showing me through the record of His Word that He is sovereign of us all.。
The Word that He has said still holds power in my life today.。
He spoke and the Word was created.。
He spoke and the Son was created and then the Son is still shining today.。
The season is still changing.。
The Word that He spoke thousands and millions of years ago is still powerful and at work。
today.。
And so just read about it.。
Know what He wants for your life and know that this is working for you in your life。
through the Bible that He's telling us.。
One of my habits of reading the Bible is through journaling.。
I know that as I put pen to paper, the fleeting thoughts and feelings were articulated and。
named and I can hand them back to my father for further conversation.。
Journaling slowed me down and got me to take each verse as I write seriously.。
Maybe you haven't tried journaling before and you want to give it a go.。
So let me share with you what I do.。
I start by sitting and quieting myself down.。
Maybe I was rushing in the morning to get myself ready.。
Maybe I was trying to catch the bus in the morning and so my mind would be everywhere.。
But this slowing and calming down and just not thinking about anything really helped。
me focus.。
You know, reading the Bible doesn't have to be, "Okay, it's time to study my English."。
It's about your moment with God and you just need to create that mind, that mindset in。
your head and go, "Okay, let me slow down.。
I don't have to think about anything.。
I can let my mind go blank and just say, 'Thank you, Jesus.。
You're here.'。
And I pray to ask the Holy Spirit to illuminate the words to me because I know that from the。
story of Emmaus, reading the Bible is not about me reading it.。
It's about the Holy Spirit talking to me, showing me what he wants to tell me today.。
And so it's not about reading a lot of scriptures.。
I have to cover the whole Bible in a year, so I have to rush through a chapter every。
day.。
I just, maybe it's about one or two verses, maybe one psalm, maybe just one psalm.。
And as I read, there would be phrases that stuck out to me and I just start writing and。
copying that verse out.。
When I start journaling, I won't wait for the whole idea to develop before I write,。
but I start writing and let the Holy Spirit lead me.。
One time when I was reading Romans 8.27, it's Romans again, but it's really one of my favorite。
books.。
I was reading Romans 8.27 and I stopped at the phrase, "He who searches my heart," or。
our hearts, "He who searches our hearts."。
And because it struck to me, it struck me, right?。
So I just wrote it on my journal and then I continued to write the following.。
I felt that there are many layers in my heart.。
At the top, it holds all the weaknesses and wrongs that I know I have and the thoughts。
I try to hide, and then the condemnation that follows it.。
But underneath that, I see the layers of hurt, the brokenness, and the disappointment.。
God doesn't just stop at the first layer.。
He searches my heart.。
He searches through all those layers.。
He knows that through the weaknesses or the sin that I made at the top, there's this brokenness。
in me.。
There's this weakness in me.。
And He has compassion for me and He will intercede for me.。
I didn't come up with this thought, but it just flows as I copy the phrases.。
You'll be surprised by the thought that you actually have when you start writing.。
It's always refreshing to try different ways to read the Word.。
I do it through journaling.。
My friends would listen to it meditatively, and I've also been listening to it while I。
get my morning ready.。
But letting the Word sink into our hearts and thinking about it throughout the day really。
helps to create that space for you to meet with God.。
On the welcome table, you can find pamphlets about hearing the Word campaign.。
I don't have it right now.。
I hold on to it the whole morning, and now it's not here.。
But on the welcome table, there's actually this Hearing the Word campaign.。
It is a Hong Kong-wide event where they planned a 47-day listening plan for the Book of Matthews.。
You can find more information about it after the service.。
But obviously, it is important to read the Word in our own time.。
It is also important to read the Word together in a community.。
I love how last Sunday, so many of us gathered together to have lunch together, to connect。
with each other and to hang out.。
That's the start of building relationships where we get to know each other's names, their。
likes and dislikes, their hobbies, and all of that.。
However, to be a community of faith, it is also important to read and discuss God's Word。
together.。
We share about a week, but also encourage each other through God's Words.。
We discuss and grow together in unity as we listen to insights that each group member。
brings.。
We allow the truth from the Scripture to unite us together and encourage each other to be。
consistent in our reading.。
God's Word is the primary way that God has chosen to make Himself known to us.。
So even if we want to know God, we cannot give up on God's Word.。
Yes, it might be a struggle, or we need to learn how to encounter God through His Word,。
but God loves revealing Himself to us.。
There's a whole book about Him that we can read about.。
He loves to speak to us personally through His Word and making Himself known, just like。
He did to me when I was struggling.。
So let me end with two encouragement.。
For one, join a community group and learn with others how to read the Word.。
And secondly, carve out time to read a short passage of God's Words.。
Ask God to reveal Himself to you through His Word.。
Pay attention to what stands out, sit with that, and ask God to clarify what He might。
be saying to you through His Word.。
God loves revealing Himself, so if we can be confident that God loves revealing Himself。
so we can be confident when we ask Him in prayer that He will.。
I'd love to pray over us, so would you all please stand and the worship team can come。
forward.。
Maybe you are feeling stagnant in your Bible reading.。
Maybe there were a lot of guilt that you carried when you read the Bible and you don't like。
reading it and there's a lot of burden that you've put on yourself.。
And I'd just like to pray for you.。
I'd like to pray for us to meet God afresh, to cast all the burdens on Him and just come。
to enjoy His Word with us together.。
So let us pray.。
Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You that You reveal Yourself to us through Your Word.。
We thank You that we're able to encounter You through the Scriptures that You have given。
us.。
We also cry out to You that there are times when we don't understand You, when it's been。
a struggle to read Your Word and there are burdens that comes along with it when I don't。
understand what You are talking about.。
And so we pray, we pray that this is not your heart to have guilt and burden when reading。
Your Word, that through Your power, help us to cast these worries and burden aside and。
help us to enjoy just spending time with You, reading about You.。
You tell us that You are love.。
You tell us that through Your Word that You come to save, that through Your Word that's。
redemption and peace and life.。
And we just want to come to You afresh today.。
We want to seek You through Your Word.。
We are not satisfied with how we are reading, but we want to go deeper and read more about。
who You are.。
And so God, please come and speak to us through Your Word.。
Come and let us encounter You afresh.。
We want to know who You really are, who You really, really are.。
Thank You God that You love us and You meet us where we are at.。
Thank You God even though we don't understand, You still come up to show us who You are.。
Thank You that You give us Your Word.。
In Jesus' name we pray, amen.。
Amen.。
Amen.。
