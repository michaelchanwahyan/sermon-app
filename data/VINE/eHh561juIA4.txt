Thank you, Ivan.。
Do I-- is this here OK?。
OK.。
All right, good morning.。
My name is Justin.。
I'm one of the pastors at the Vine Wan Chai,。
but I've been here a couple of times.。
I was here three weeks ago.。
My wife Patsy here.。
We're here together with our children.。
So thank you for having us.。
Thank you, Tim, for having us.。
Wherever you are, I know you're watching.。
Just want to say hi to you and Chris and Elle.。
Hopefully, you're having a good time.。
We miss you.。
And so yeah, before we start, I would like to pray for us.。
So I'm just going to pray again.。
Not saying that you're praying.。
But anyways, I just want to pray for us。
to receive today's word.。
So would you pray with me?。
Lord, we ask you to give us a humble heart, a listening。
heart, a receptive heart this morning.。
Father, I know all of us are going。
through different seasons.。
We're going through different obstacles.。
We're going through different things in our lives。
where holding and juggling different things.。
And so Lord, you know that.。
And so we just ask you to speak a specific word to each of us。
here tonight, today, this morning.。
Father, in your name we pray.。
Amen.。
So I found this out this week.。
My friend told me that Yuen Long used to be and still is。
a very rich land for farming.。
And I know for those of us who live in Yuen Long,。
we work in Yuen Long.。
This is a specialty, especially before the 1980s.。
There were so many plots of vegetable land.。
There were grains of rice.。
And this rice and the grain would。
feed Yuen Long, the people of Yuen Long,。
but also the people of Hong Kong.。
And so I bring this up not just as a trivial, interesting fact,。
but I bring this up because it's profound for us today。
to worship together knowing that we。
sit on a historically rich land for farming.。
And today we are going to talk about farming.。
We're talking about the parable of the sower, the seeds,。
and the soil.。
And I titled today's message, A Parable on Grace and Listening.。
So right now, I just want to ask you to read with me.。
I'm going to read Mark chapter 4, verse 1 to 20.。
So I ask you to follow along with me.。
Verse 1, "Again, Jesus began to teach by the sea.。
And such a very large crowd gathered to him。
that he got into a boat on the sea and sat down.。
And the whole crowd was by the sea on the land.。
And he was teaching the many things in parables。
and was saying to them in his teaching, listen to this.。
Behold, the sower went out to sow.。
As he was sowing, some seed fell beside the road,。
and the birds came and ate it up.。
Other seed fell on the rocky ground。
where it did not have much soil.。
And immediately it sprang up because it。
had no depth of soil.。
And when the sun had risen, it was scorched.。
And because it had no root, it withered away.。
Other seed fell among the thorns,。
and the thorns came up and choked it,。
and it yielded no crop.。
Other seeds fell into the good soil.。
And as they grew up and increased,。
they yielded a crop and produced 30, 60,。
and 100 times as much.。
And he was saying, he who has ears to hear, let him hear.。
Verse 10.。
As soon as Jesus was alone, his followers,。
along with the 12 disciples,。
began asking him about the parables.。
And he was saying to them, to you has been given。
the mystery of the kingdom of God.。
But for those who are outside, everything comes in parables.。
So that while seeing, they may see, and not perceive.。
And while hearing, they may hear and not understand.。
Otherwise, they might return,。
and it would be forgiven them.。
Verse 13.。
And Jesus said to them, do you not understand this parable?。
How will you understand all the parables?。
The sower sows the word.。
These are the ones who are beside the road。
where the word is sown.。
And when they hear, immediately Satan comes。
and takes away the word which had been sown in them.。
And in a similar way, these are the ones。
sown with seed on the rocky places,。
who when they hear the word,。
immediately receive it with joy,。
and yet they have no firm rooting in themselves,。
but are only temporary.。
Then when affliction or persecution occurs。
because of the word, immediately they fall away.。
Verse 18.。
And others are the ones sown with seed among the thorns.。
These are the ones who have heard the word,。
but the worries of the world,。
and the deceitfulness of wealth,。
and the desires for other things。
enter and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.。
And those are the ones sown with seed on the good soil,。
and they hear the word and accept it,。
and bear fruit 30, 60, and 100 times as much.。
So this passage may be familiar to many of us.。
We've maybe heard it many times,。
but this morning I ask,。
no matter how many times you've heard this,。
Jesus begins and ends this parable。
with a very profound and straightforward command.。
He says, "Listen, church, listen to what I have to say.。
"I want you to listen and hear。
"what I'm trying to say to you."。
Because I do personally believe。
there's something inherently important。
he wants to get us to hear.。
But before we jump into today's sermon,。
I want to ask you,。
when was the last time you heard Jesus speak to you?。
I want you just to think about the last time.。
It could have been this morning,。
it could have been this week,。
it could have been years ago,。
it could have been, actually, I don't know.。
And I want you to think,。
what did it mean to you that Jesus would speak to you?。
The word that you received, what was that like?。
Where were you?。
What place in your life did Jesus speak to you。
and you just thought, wow?。
I want you to hold this because I know。
the basis of many of our lives.。
We, professionally or personally,。
we do a lot of listening.。
And I think a lot of us, naturally,。
we listen when we find something important。
or something that's worth listening to.。
And as I was thinking about this for myself,。
I remember one time, I think I heard God.。
It sounded like God, certainly.。
It matched with scripture.。
My friends and family also said,。
yeah, this is perhaps God.。
And I decided that, you know what?。
I'm gonna listen to this, I'm gonna lean in,。
I'm gonna respond.。
I'm just gonna live this out.。
And here I am, 14 years later, as a pastor at the Vine.。
And that was a time when, in faith,。
it could have been God, maybe it wasn't God, I don't know.。
But I trusted it was God.。
Now, this morning, I'm saying,。
I really actually believe that every opportunity。
we have to listen can change our life.。
Maybe not in such a radical way that I'm talking about,。
but every word has the potential。
to change the course of our heart.。
So that's why today I want you to listen.。
And I chose today's passage for a very specific reason,。
because this passage calls us to seriously reflect。
on our state of listening.。
Are we good listeners?。
'Cause I think a lot of times, I'm a terrible listener.。
I'm a bad listener.。
But I know I can also be a better listener.。
And so in this parable, listening is equated。
to receptivity to God's word.。
It's being able to take God's word,。
to take it seriously, and to contemplate。
what is God saying to us.。
And so this parable, therefore,。
calls us to reflect this morning。
on our ability to listen to God。
in a way that builds our intimacy with God.。
Because I know this is our theme this year。
across the two Vine churches.。
And so I want us to reflect on our state of listening,。
how we listen to God this morning.。
So I'm gonna break it down this morning.。
I'm gonna give you some context for this passage.。
I'm gonna go into detail about what this passage。
is talking about, what Jesus is talking about.。
And I wanna end this message to share on,。
for us to reflect on God's grace for us.。
Is that okay?。
All right.。
So some context for this passage.。
In verse one to two, Jesus, as we read,。
is already in a boat by the shore.。
He's teaching a large crowd about God's kingdom.。
And everything about God and who he is。
and the mysteries of God's kingdom.。
In verses three to nine, Jesus tells us this parable。
about a farmer sowing seeds and what happens to these seeds.。
In verse 13 to 20, Jesus privately explains this parable。
to his disciples and other people。
that were around listening.。
And so the imagery of this parable。
of a farmer sowing seeds would have been very familiar。
to first century Christians, especially the farmers。
that were in the crowd listening to Jesus.。
They would have understood just the whole process。
of what it meant to sow seeds and to the hard work。
that took to protecting the seed,。
making sure the seed germinates, watering,。
protecting the crops from the elements。
and making sure that at the end of the season。
that there would be yield, there would be a harvest.。
And it was, I can't even imagine being a farmer,。
but here we are.。
And so there's a few characters,。
main characters in this parable.。
And it is the sower, the seeds, and the soil.。
So the sower, of course, is the Father,。
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.。
Or the sower could be any Christian。
that preaches God's word concerning Jesus and God's kingdom.。
The seeds in this parable, the second character,。
is God's word or the gospel about Jesus.。
And lastly, the soil.。
I thought long and hard about this,。
but the soil, I think today, I want us to think about it。
as conditions for bad listening and for good listening.。
So that's what the soil represents,。
conditions for bad and good listening.。
Now, I don't think they're permanent states,。
but I think they're situations and seasons。
that we find ourselves in,。
and we can easily move from a season of bad listening。
to a season of, oh, I can hear something.。
You know, I can perceive something.。
Church, at the heart of what Jesus is teaching about today。
in this parable sits a discipleship issue.。
Discipleship is a fancy word for our journey with Jesus.。
Discipleship is a process where day in, day out,。
we learn to pray, we learn to be with God,。
we learn to worship together,。
we learn to wrestle with God's word,。
and we learn to grow in the midst of troubles,。
persecutions, afflictions, heartaches, suffering.。
And so what Jesus is teaching us today。
is what happens when we follow him。
and the process of how we can grow as disciples.。
Jesus wants us to know, and I want you to know,。
that being his disciples is extremely difficult,。
and I think you already know that.。
It is challenging, it is difficult.。
Why?。
Because we will always encounter barriers and obstacles。
that prevent us from being with him.。
And as Christians, as I said,。
we will go through seasons where we grow, we flourish,。
we just are so excited.。
We wake up and we want to be in God's word,。
we want to talk about God's word.。
But at the same time, we also go in seasons。
where it's so difficult to hear God's word.。
It's difficult because I don't want to hear God's word.。
You know, it's difficult for the circumstances。
and the obstacles that we're going through,。
but sometimes we are unable to grow,。
we're unable to hear God's word,。
is what this parable wants to teach us about.。
And the last thing I want to say about context。
is that I think today it's helpful for us。
to think about our Christian growth,。
our discipleship process, that is dependent on two things.。
One, our growth is dependent on the sower.。
It's dependent on God's grace.。
It's God's grace and his sovereignty and his love for us。
and the church that we grow.。
And the second thing, we grow because of our own effort,。
our willingness to hear God's word,。
our willingness to really trust that the living God。
wants to speak to me and wants to speak to us today.。
And so it's healthy to think about both。
as we listen to this parable.。
Okay, are you guys ready?。
We're gonna go into detail。
on what this parable is speaking about.。
So in this parable, this farmer,。
he is sowing four batches of seed into the ground.。
And each batch, it's actually the same seed.。
It falls on four different types of soil conditions.。
And so right now, I want to explain to you。
what each soil condition represents。
according to this passage.。
And I also want to speak about what obstacles and barriers。
each batch of seed represents。
and what happens as a result, okay?。
So the first soil condition is those seeds。
that fall along the path.。
And so in verse three and four,。
the seeds fall beside the path where the birds come in。
and immediately, they eat up all the seeds.。
And in verse 15, Jesus, when explaining to his disciples,。
he says that when the word is preached and heard,。
Satan immediately comes in and takes away what was sown。
so that there's no chance for the seed to germinate.。
So the first obstacle is, in fact, Satan,。
who's aggressive and who's so hostile。
to any potential disciple to,。
basically, Satan does not want anyone to hear God's word.。
So therefore, he comes and plucks away God's word.。
And so while we should not cower and live in fear,。
I think it's wise and prudent, though,。
to remember that, yes, there are forces of evil。
that are against us, that resist God's word,。
that resist us from hearing God's word.。
And this is a reality that we live in.。
And I don't know about you,。
but this happens to me all the time.。
Every time we hear an encouragement,。
something amazing happens in our hearts。
that we attribute to God,。
then immediately, Satan comes in and whispers something,。
and we're reminded of a fear.。
We start doubting, is this really God?。
Maybe it's not even God.。
Every week, when I'm servicely,。
when I'm with you guys, this happens.。
And I think, really, we just have to remember。
that not to be scared, but to know that,。
at times, Satan does, it directly,。
want to take away and steal away。
what God is wanting to give us.。
So the second soil condition is the rocky road.。
So in this soil condition, in verses five to six,。
after scattering the seed,。
the seeds immediately spring up。
because it says in scripture。
that they have no depth in the soil.。
And when the scorching sun comes up,。
this little seed that sprouted,。
it withers because it had no rooting.。
It had no deep rooting in the soil.。
And when Jesus was explaining this to his disciples。
in verse 16 and 17, Jesus says,。
"These are the people who hear God's word,。
"and immediately, they receive it with joy."。
They are so excited that God is speaking to them.。
But their joy is short-lived。
because when the sun comes up,。
when persecution comes, when trouble comes,。
on account of the word, these listeners fall away.。
So the second obstacle is trouble.。
It's suffering.。
It's hard times.。
It's persecution.。
And it's going through these。
that causes disciples to fall away.。
Now, I wanna explain falling away.。
Once again, it's not a permanent state,。
but falling away, I think,。
describes an inability to follow Christ in that moment.。
And so we all encounter these moments where we're unable.。
We are unable to sustain a closeness,。
an intimacy with God,。
and that's what this soil represents.。
And once again, I want to remind us this is normal.。
This is not an abnormal,。
like this only happens to 10 or 5% of us.。
This is a fact of our daily lives.。
And historically, this was a very common problem,。
a common reality for the early church。
because being persecuted was synonymous。
with being a Christian back in the first century.。
A lot of Christians, they remained faithful to God。
even onto death, and we called them martyrs.。
They were willing to die for their faith.。
Now, of course, there were many that stumbled and fell away,。
and we don't actually get to hear about their accounts.。
And we do remember Peter, right, in the Gospels,。
and he vowed vigorously that,。
Lord, I will never deny you,。
and remember what happens.。
In his humanness, in the light of persecution,。
he was scared and he fled.。
Now, of course, when we read the whole Gospel,。
we realize that Peter grew from that,。
and he became one of the greatest disciples.。
And it says that the church was built upon him.。
And so maybe not every one of us would struggle。
or have struggled to a point of death,。
but some of us, I know, have been persecuted.。
A lot of us have been persecuted because of our faith,。
our family members not agreeing。
with this lifestyle choice that we made.。
And I know, actually, I've heard of some of you。
who work in very aggressive work environments。
where being a Christian is actually frowned upon,。
but yet somehow you persevered,。
somehow you remained faithful.。
And for us in Hong Kong,。
I don't know what the future brings.。
None of us do.。
I don't know how religious freedom is in the future,。
but I think listening has an impact today.。
Our listening today, in God's word,。
has an impact in how we respond tomorrow.。
So, so far, I just wanna recap。
in these first two soil conditions。
that the ability to retain Jesus's word meaningfully。
in these first two soil conditions is temporal。
because, one, the seed never had space to grow,。
and also, these two soil conditions,。
they prevent good listening.。
Now, I want to talk about the third soil conditions,。
which is the thorns.。
So in verse seven,。
when the seeds fell among the thorns,。
the thorns immediately came up and choked it。
and suffocated the seeds so that no crop could grow,。
so that seed could not germinate.。
And when explaining to his disciples,。
Jesus said that these are those who heard the word,。
but the cares of the world, the worries,。
the temptation of wealth,。
and the desire for other things。
prevented the word, God's word, from bearing any fruit.。
And so the third obstacles,。
we're talking about the worries that we have,。
the temptation of wealth, or even affluence,。
and these desires, they distract us, they entice us,。
they seduce us away from the path with Christ.。
And so the seeds never germinate or grows。
because we put our resources on all these other things。
and not on protecting God's word, so allowing it to grow.。
And I hate to mention this this morning, but I have to.。
The things that we're talking about here。
is maybe our mobile devices, right?。
It's maybe Netflix.。
It is.。
Some of us, even for good intentions,。
I overwork all the time, and that's a struggle,。
but yet it pulls me away from God.。
I'm two months to finishing。
my three-year master's right now,。
but the cost of the last three years。
has been immense in terms of time away from family,。
time away from God, and I feel it.。
And so there is a cost to our discipleship,。
and Mark actually highlights,。
and I want you to remember this。
and think about this in your life,。
that greed and affluence and having enough。
or wanting more will hinder and affect God's work in us.。
In Mark 10, verse 21, you remember this,。
there's a rich man, he turns away from Jesus' call。
because he had too much wealth,。
and he didn't want to give up the system。
in which he exploited the poor.。
And then there was Judas, who betrayed his own master,。
Jesus, for a small, small amount of money.。
And so this morning, I think God would want us。
to soberly reflect why it is so difficult。
for the rich to enter God's kingdom, right?。
Why it is so difficult, and I think we understand.。
And so if I can pull together so far。
what we've been talking about,。
this morning we're talking about discipleship,。
we're talking about conditions。
for good listening and bad listening,。
we're talking about the obstacles。
that will come in our way, in all of our ways,。
and affect and impact our faith.。
And once again, I want to say that this parable。
is talking about our spiritual reality.。
This is the tension which all of us。
will have to learn to navigate,。
and that's why Jesus is saying,。
"Church, I want you to hear me.。
"I want you to listen to what I'm saying to you."。
And actually, this warning, this parable,。
is it speaks so much about the scribes。
and the Pharisees in the Gospels.。
Imagine how many times they heard Jesus preach.。
Imagine how many times they heard God's word,。
but yet, what happens?。
Satan comes and steals the word from them,。
and they stop believing, they cannot believe.。
They vigorously reject the idea that God is Lord,。
so they kind of fall away in their discipleship.。
And of course, ultimately, they fell away from Jesus。
because they did not understand what Jesus was doing.。
That is why they couldn't have a relationship,。
a discipleship with Him.。
And so I want to say and acknowledge。
that the tension is real.。
And lastly, I want to talk about the good soil.。
In the fourth soil condition, in verse eight,。
the grains fall on good soil,。
and these crops, they grew in an abundant harvest。
of 30, 60, and 100-fold.。
The early church, when they immediately heard。
of bearing fruit, that these crops bore fruit,。
they would immediately equate this。
to faithfulness to Christ.。
So what this means for us is that to be faithful。
to Christ requires time.。
It requires a process for seeds to grow.。
It requires overcoming.。
And in terms of obstacles, the last batch of seeds。
grew to a harvest because these listeners。
were able to understand God's word.。
They were able to wrestle with God's word.。
They were able to trust that God's word。
would lead them through whatever obstacle。
and hindrances would come.。
And as a result, these seeds, these listeners,。
grew abundantly, they grew to a point。
of surpassing all human understanding.。
And so I think to remain in good soil。
is to humbly allow God to lead us。
and to teach us what it means to grow deep roots。
so that we do not lose sight of the new life。
that Jesus calls each of us into, which is God's kingdom.。
[audience laughing]。
And so you can see now that the different soil conditions。
that the first centuries Christians navigated through。
is not so much different than the discipleship reality。
that we live in right now.。
And preparing for this message,。
I reflected on the last 25 years of being a Christian.。
I reflected on the last 14 years of working in a church,。
which I think is one of the hardest places to work,。
I think, from experience.。
And so I just wanna list out,。
in relation to today's parable,。
some of the struggles I've gone through.。
It's gonna just come up here.。
You know, and you can go through this list,。
and I am sure you can relate to how。
and imagine how these things can cause us to be distracted,。
could cause us to stumble,。
it can cause us to be enticed away.。
But I just wanna speak into a few of these personally.。
In the last 10 years, I think all of us have experienced。
people leaving Hong Kong, right, family, friends.。
That's been hard, especially working in a church.。
But add to that, I've experienced a lot of brothers。
and sisters who walked away from the faith.。
I think they decided that it was just too difficult。
to sustain discipleship, and that is discouraging.。
There are times where I just ask the Lord,。
I would talk to my wife, and maybe I should just do the same.。
It just would be easier, you know.。
Another thing is apathy.。
I think all of us have to be very careful with apathy.。
And we get offended, I get offended, something happens,。
and my heart just gets harder, it grows harder.。
It's just less receptive to God's word.。
When Jesus talked about the rich man。
having the dangers of being wealthy,。
which I think a lot of us are, would say that,。
"You know, we are actually rich when we think about it."。
And that is distracting, that is difficult to navigate.。
How do I be faithful and enjoy the life that we have?。
I struggle with that, I feel bad all the time.。
And then lastly, I don't think I've been persecuted。
to a point of death, but I remember one time,。
I was trying to help this girl escape。
her abusive relationship with her boyfriend.。
And so we were in Wan Chai in the coffee shop,。
and the boyfriend, unbeknownst to us, came,。
but he refused to come in the church.。
It's like he couldn't, and he was just angry,。
he was powerful, he was strong,。
and he just kept on yelling obscenities.。
And I just thought that it was an attack,。
it was Satan using the situation,。
and that really scared me, right?。
But all that to say, I think looking back,。
I can attest to the fact that God's grace。
has always been in these situations。
when I was going through it,。
and sometimes I just was not aware,。
but yet God's grace was there leading.。
But yet, I also reflect back on all the effort。
I had to put in to get out of certain soil conditions,。
so certain barriers, and I think, to this day,。
I'm glad that I stand before you,。
and I still confess Christ, I still love Christ.。
My love looks a little different than before,。
and I'm okay with that, but also,。
I still believe that we have so much to do as a church.。
And so I think I share this because I think。
one of the most difficult things for us。
to practice as a Christian is the very thing。
that Jesus is talking about in this parable.。
How many of us hurry from event to event, thing to thing,。
especially for us parents or teachers,。
and there's just always needy children,。
which is the reality, right?。
But there is just so many things,。
and how many times do we say,。
hey, Lord, I'll come back to you later.。
I'll do this later, I promise.。
After I do all this, I will come back to you.。
But when you think about it, that's thorns at work, right?。
That's thorns at work in our life.。
And if there's one thing this morning。
I desperately want to convey to each of us here,。
what I wanna say is that it is extremely easy。
and effortless, it takes zero effort to stop growing。
and to walk away from God, if we choose that.。
It's effortless and it's very easy to get sidetracked,。
especially in moments of crisis,。
especially when we are persecuted, when we are suffering,。
when our hearts are broken.。
But I want to remind us once again。
that even if our hearts are broken,。
even if we are suffering in this moment。
and we cannot bear it, God is still faithful,。
and he's still gonna scatter seeds generously。
until one seed hits the good soil,。
it hits our heart and it grows.。
And for that, I think it's worth it.。
And recently, I think as an encouragement,。
I was very encouraged that these three,。
four soil conditions, it actually represents。
our universal human Christian experience.。
That this doesn't just happen to holy people,。
it happens to all of us 'cause we are holy.。
We love God and Satan would do everything。
to get us off course.。
And so I wanna say that no Christian。
is immune from falling away,。
just as no Christian couple is immune from divorce, right?。
I think Satan will continue to do his work。
and we will always have trouble.。
Once we solve one problem, another problem comes in, right?。
We know that at work, at the home,。
in our house, I feel like we fix something good,。
you know, oh man, the lights are working again。
and then we have like another problem, right?。
And so this parable, it's in a bleak。
and black and white way, it reminds us of two realities.。
One, we are either on the way towards Jesus, with Jesus,。
or we are somehow being led away.。
We are somehow struggling, we are somehow caught up。
in thorns and we are learning to get out。
of those conditions.。
But I want to comfort you, I'm not gonna end this message。
in gloom and doom.。
I know it is difficult to be a Christian。
and I think you know that, it is difficult。
and that's okay, but it's not impossible。
because of God's grace.。
So I want to now talk about God's grace for us as a church.。
And God's grace in this parable is an invitation。
for us this morning to reflect and to enter a space。
of deeper reflection through listening,。
to think about God and how we are with him。
through a deeper listening, but also listening。
invites us to a place of deeper surrender,。
to do things differently, to put away。
and to learn how to be a better listener.。
And I believe by learning we increase our,。
by listening we increase our receptivity。
to hear God's word, to understand God's word。
so that we can actually ultimately protect God's word。
growing in our lives.。
And so this morning right now to conclude。
I want to offer us three ways that God's grace。
is evident in this parable.。
And the first way is that God's grace reminds us。
that the kingdom of God is always at work。
even when we are not aware.。
And this is a hope, this is a promise for us。
that the sower that is Christ will continue。
to sow seeds and scatter seeds generously。
until it germinates beyond our wildest imaginations.。
And so Mark is reminding his listeners back then。
that against any setbacks, against any principalities,。
against any obstacles, God's kingdom will still advance。
and God's kingdom will continue to be victorious.。
So for those of us here this morning。
we're listening to God's word,。
we're learning to listen to God's word.。
We should continue to do so.。
For those of us who are faithful in preaching God's word。
we continue to share the gospel with our family,。
with our colleagues, with our friends.。
Let us remain steadfast, let us remain faithful。
because each seed has hope to grow。
and it just has to hit a good soil.。
And I think a lot of us are here。
because God's word hits good soil。
and we heard God and we're here.。
The second thing God's grace reminds us of this morning。
is God's paradoxical perspective on suffering.。
I think only in God's kingdom does hardship,。
suffering, persecution enables Jesus' community。
to grow and advance.。
That our discipleship, our journey with Jesus。
does not diminish but it actually yields a harvest。
if we are willing to harvest that.。
And the harvest here in this parable。
is really to know him.。
You know the harvest that triples,。
that goes 60 folds, 100 folds,。
it's the reality that we can know a living God.。
To know that his word is true, his promises is true.。
That is the harvest that we desire.。
And so we are able to overcome barriers。
and obstacles because we believe。
that the word of God is true, that he is true。
and that he is faithful to us.。
And the last, I think God's grace reminds us。
in this parable that each of us have to,。
we each of us bear the responsibility to stop and to listen.。
That each of us have this responsibility。
to listen to God's word because our very lives,。
our very faith depends on understanding。
what Jesus is saying to us.。
I think there are, as I said,。
I think there's too many ways for us as Christians。
to fall away, for our hearts to feel cold,。
for us to be distracted and enticed and seduced.。
And so it is our responsibility to figure out。
whether we want to be in that good soil.。
It's our responsibility to ask God to teach us。
how do we set deeper roots into the ground。
so that when the sun comes, when persecution comes,。
we are not blown away easily.。
It is our responsibilities to ask our neighbors。
to help us weed out some of the thorns。
in our gardens and our lives。
so that we can stay focused on Jesus.。
And so church, I want to just lastly say,。
let us take seriously this responsibility。
so that we can minimize the chances of being uprooted,。
of being deceived and being enticed away.。
And so this morning, I will really end now.。
I want to just ask us, how should we respond?。
How can we respond this morning?。
Thank you, Owen.。
You know, and this morning, really, once again,。
I'm talking about our discipleship journey,。
our relationship with Jesus.。
And I think by learning to listen,。
we are able to understand the four soil conditions,。
the spiritual tension, the reality。
that we live out our faith in,。
and that we can hopefully avoid some of the traps。
and we can continue to just grow and to enjoy Jesus。
and enjoy our worshiping of Jesus together.。
And if we do learn to listen,。
then we can continue to rely on God's word。
and then we are able to retain the vision。
of what it means to be Christ followers in this world.。
So that we can allow other people。
and bring other people to experience this harvest.。
And so church, I want to just ask you。
to really take seriously today。
and to take time to stop and pause。
and to listen to what God might be saying。
to you this morning.。
Because without God's word,。
I think we are only followers by name and by association.。
What makes us, I remember what Pastor John。
was preaching three weeks ago,。
what makes us salt and light。
is that we understand God's word.。
It's God's word that brings life to us。
and it's our ability to share God's word with others。
that makes us distinctly different and attractive。
and that is the only really way。
we can have conversations about God。
with through his word anyways.。
And so I just last say, I just want to encourage you.。
I know maybe some of us, you feel,。
we feel that we're in unfruitful soil.。
And to you, if that is you, I want to say, do not panic.。
Do not be ashamed, do not be afraid.。
You know, these conditions that we're in,。
they're not permanent.。
They're seasons, maybe it's been a very long season for you.。
But I just want to encourage you。
and I want to pray for you in a moment。
that we would find our way back to God's soil.。
We would just hold on to that seed that God has given you.。
And so I just, last thing I want to say。
that even if we momentarily walk away from God,。
once again, the faithful sower will continue。
just to sow his seeds until his seeds。
hit the good soil for us.。
And so church, can I pray for us?。
Can I ask you to stand?。
(gentle music)。
Father, we thank you for your word.。
And Father, we ask that this morning。
you would give us the courage to continue just to listen.。
And Father, for those of us who are facing some obstacles,。
we are facing hardship,。
we find it difficult to hear your word.。
We feel distracted, we feel there's too many things。
going on in our lives.。
Father, I pray for,。
I pray, Father, that your seed would be attractive,。
your word in us would lead us out of these moments,。
Lord God.。
Father, you would teach us how to hear your word today,。
what to do with your word today,。
how to make time to just grow the seed, Lord God,。
that you've given us.。
And Father, I pray that you give us courage each day。
to live faithfully to you, to follow you, Jesus.。
And so Father, right now we choose to worship you.。
Father, we choose to follow you, and that is our desire.。
And Lord, I just wanna pray that your word。
would be more desirable than the riches of this world.。
It would be more desirable, more...。
Lord, it would just, Lord, we would just have,。
Lord, we would just want your word so badly,。
and that we would just learn。
to treasure your word in our life.。
That is what I wanna pray for us today.。
And so Jesus, we turn our eyes again to you in worship,。
in surrender, in reflection.。
So would you lead us in your name we pray, amen.。
Let's worship him together.。
