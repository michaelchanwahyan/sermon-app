This is not a church in the singular, on its own and distinct,。
but a church in the plural, united across a nation, joined in purpose,。
focused on building up God's kingdom one life at a time.。
It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA。
the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,。
and that celebrates in the freedom and grace that such a story brings.。
This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,。
but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,。
desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local soil.。
A church that sees salvation as holistic,。
transforming God's people for God's work,。
and equipping a generation to represent God's heart。
to the poor, the weak, the oppressed and the persecuted.。
Imagine this church committed to seeing the family。
as integral to all that it's called to be and do,。
involving intentional, committed and authentic relationships across all levels.。
It is the sort of place where both the young and the old。
feel cared for, supported and equipped.。
A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions。
come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic,。
that honours and embraces a richness in diversity。
that marks us as the body of Christ.。
It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively,。
reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.。
A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,。
and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives.。
Where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith,。
rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.。
A church that does not make its Sunday services。
the exclamation mark of its existence,。
but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence.。
A time of service, love and engagement。
that inspires and emboldens all equally。
for the conversation that lies ahead.。
A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.。
This is our city.。
This is our church.。
This is our home.。
Good morning, everyone.。
Everyone good?。
God is good.。
All the time, come on.。
This old-fashioned thing, come on.。
God is good.。
All the time.。
Yes, we should have this, right?。
Yeah, I hope you guys are feeling good.。
During our fasting period,。
we are coming to the third week.。
I don't know how you're feeling, how your fasting journey.。
But for myself, today a little bit cold, I feel more hungry.。
And when I'm hungry, I feel more, I need more spirit,。
like more energy.。
I need more spirit, like fill me and really God.。
And then when I pray, it brings me to a, of course, scripture.。
Let me read for you guys.。
In Romans 8, you are controlled not by the sinful nature,。
but by the spirit.。
If the spirit of God lives in you, if Christ is in you,。
your body is dead because of sin.。
Yes, your spirit is alive because of righteousness.。
And if the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead。
is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead。
will also give life to your mortal bodies,。
food his spirit who live in you.。
Wow, this one is so touch and encourage me,。
like my body is also belong to God.。
When I'm fasting, oh, there's some physical needs,。
but actually that's a good time to let the spirit。
to take the control on us.。
It's talking about living spirit, living body.。
So when we worship, we should have a living body, right?。
Not like a dead person, come on.。
So why don't we stand up?。
I invite you all like stand up and then let us have a prayer。
and then let the Holy Spirit lead us to worship, to praise him,。
to lift up not only our spirit.。
Our spirit should within us, but also exactly,。
completely connect with our body.。
When we worship, we are worshiping our God。
with our whole heart and whole body.。
Let us pray.。
Father, we thank you for your spirit come.。
Thank you for give us this room, this space,。
this opportunity for us this few weeks.。
We can really hear your voice, really feel your presence。
and really see your work in us.。
So Lord, we praise you.。
We lift up our voice and heart to worship you。
so that your spirit will hear and your name be praised。
and be lifted up.。
We pray that in the name of Jesus.。
Amen.。

When we were at the show, I saw a picture.。
There's a train.。
The train's supposed to be running very fast,。
very quick, high speed.。
But I saw that there are lots of things on the cargoes,。
the containers.。
One, two, three, four, five, six,。
many, many of the containers,。
there's a lot of stuff。
that make the train running so slow, struggling.。
And when it arrives, it lands to a station.。
That station, the train can load on。
all that heavy stuff, load it on.。
I sense the Holy Spirit telling us today,。
we are holding too much on the train,。
on the cargoes.。
There may be some hurts, fear, death, a fate.。
There's something happened in our life.。
But nor today, here is the station for us。
to really take this down, release it.。
And then it being alive,。
and then we have room to be filled by the Spirit,。
filled by life.。
And then we can run very fast.。
And then that train can even。
to have more and more passenger to come in,。
to go in, to go far,。
to go to that direction that God leading us to go.。
But nor today, here is the station.。
That station is for us。
to really put these things down, the heavy things down.。
I would like to read one more scripture for you guys.。
It's a few verses after what I read。
in the beginning of service.。
"Now if we are children, then we are hearers.。
We are hearers of God and coherent with Christ.。
If indeed we share in His suffering,。
in order that we may also share in His glory."。
Lord Jesus, we thank you for your suffering.。
And you let us know, you understand us,。
you know us, you feel us, and you're suffering for us.。
And when we receive that,。
when we let you do your work in us,。
we bring you glory.。
It's not by our own strength, but by you.。
Even though we are suffering, we are struggling,。
when you come, when we let it go, when we open,。
when we go to this station today。
to let you do your work in us,。
that glory is for you.。
That glory is for you.。
Glorify you, Lord.。
Lord, may you be with us.。
So that when we are coming to the coming song for the worship,。
you speak to us, you let us know。
how we can really, really low down these things,。
and then to have the room for you to feel us.。
[music]。
I just, I really feel like we need to continue singing this song.。
[music]。
Whatever circumstances we face,。
God is constant, God is unchanging, and God is unfailing.。
And his word remains truth.。
It's the standard.。
[music]。
Last week, my dad died,。
and it's been the hardest week of my life.。
And singing these words,。
"Where there was death, you brought life,"。
is so difficult to sing with what has happened.。
But it doesn't change who God is,。
it doesn't change what he does,。
and it doesn't change his word.。
And just because my dad is dead here,。
it doesn't mean that there's no life,。
because he is living in eternity with the Savior.。
And so when we sing these songs and we go through things,。
we may often feel like there's a lie,。
or that God is not consistent,。
or he isn't who he says he is, but he is.。
And what we go through doesn't change or affect the nature of God.。
And so we're going to sing the bridge again.。
And maybe some of you are also mourning.。
Maybe some of you are mourning a family member,。
or you've lost some part of your life that you never thought you would lose.。
But God restores.。
God is a healer.。
God is unchanging.。
And God knows how you are feeling,。
and he is with you in this moment.。
So let's sing the bridge again.。
Where there was death, you brought life, Lord.。
Where there was fear, you brought courage.。
When I was afraid, you were with me.。
And you lifted me up, and you lifted me up.。
Where there was death, you brought life, Lord.。
Where there was fear, you brought courage.。
When I was afraid, you were with me.。
And you lifted me up, and you lifted me up.。
Where there was death, you brought life, Lord.。
Where there was fear, you brought courage.。
When I was afraid, you were with me.。
And you lifted me up, and you lifted me up.。
And you lifted me up, and you lifted me up.。
And you lifted me up, and you lifted me up.。
We sing God with us.。
God for us.。
Nothing can come against.。
No one can stand between us.。
God with us.。
God for us.。
Nothing can come against.。
No one can stand between us.。
[MUSIC PLAYING]。
God with us.。
God for us.。
Nothing can come against.。
No one can stand between us.。
Holy Spirit, come.。
Holy Spirit, come.。
Holy Spirit, come to comfort us, to comfort our hearts,。
to heal us.。
There's no one like you.。
There's no one like you that much, know us that much.。
You know our needs.。
You know our heart.。
You know our suffering.。
You know our loss.。
You know what we need.。
Holy Spirit, come.。
Lord, we thank you for your presence.。
Thank you for giving us that hope.。
You lifted us up when we lost hope.。
You tell us you are hope.。
You give life.。
You give hope.。
You give us to see the picture that we are with you,。
and we will with you as well.。
We pray for Harriet.。
We pray for her loss.。
We pray for your presence to heal everyone who needs.。
Lord, may you-- may your hand just touch us,。
by yourself.。
We know that that comforts have to come from you.。
We know that today you are coming to heal everyone of us.。
Thank you for letting us to put down these heavies。
and fill with your hope and love.。
With the courage that you're giving us,。
that's why today we can proclaim we are your children,。
and we have the same hope in the future.。
And now, this is our home.。
You called us to be here because you are with us here.。
Your spirit is with us here.。
We thank you for all your works, and may your will be done.。
We pray that in Jesus' name.。
Everyone says, amen.。
Amen.。
Why don't we give a round of applause to our Father,。
our God, and the Holy Spirit.。
I believe that God is really working something among us.。
Please have a seat.。
I think this is a quite special day today.。
Holy Spirit have special work in us.。
I believe that God is not tend to lead us to something super heavy。
that we cannot stand, but there's some things like here,。
as I mentioned in the prayer, we arrive at a station。
so that we can let God to freely do his work on us.。
So I hope you're ready.。
If not, I pray for you guys.。
God won't push everyone of us to do anything we don't want.。
That's really what we want to touch us and love us.。
So, yeah, wow, wow.。
What a powerful worship.。
I would like to also thank you, everyone, your presence.。
And we want to welcome for those who are the first time to come to join us.。
If you are very first time to come to join our service, our church,。
Divine Church, you know, you might wave your hand, wave your hand.。
Hello, so that we can welcome you.。
Yeah, we are not always like make you cry that the Spirit move.。
Yeah, we are open and we are also very welcome you to join us.。
If you want to be more connected with our congregation, our church,。
here is the QR code.。
You can scan it and then leave up your information so that we can connect you.。
And the other way we have another communication platform is a WhatsApp group.。
Sorry, I speak Cantonese.。
I was leading Cantonese service and then bilingual, okay?。
WhatsApp channel, this WhatsApp channel.。
So you can scan it, join the group, and then you will be regulated to receive。
our announcement or something important in our church.。
Like during the fasting period, every morning 6 a.m.,。
we will send out a daily devotion to help us to go through this amazing。
fasting journey together.。
So, yeah, please join.。
And this is the time we can pass our children among us to the K4C room.。
So if you have children around you, I invite you to stretch your hand on them。
and then we can pray for them all together.。
Father, we thank you for your love.。
We thank you that Holy Spirit also touched these beautiful children。
so that they know you.。
You said we know you because of your spirit so that we can understand your。
word and understand you.。
So your spirit upon them, they enjoy their cars, they enjoy the K4C cars,。
and they can grow faith in you.。
We pray that in Jesus' name, amen, amen.。
Boys and girls, it's your party time.。
[Laughter]。
Yahoo!。
So after a minute, I will come back and have some announcements for you all.。

Yeah, hello, I'm back.。
Hi, by the way, I am Ivan, one of the pastors of the Vang Yuen Long.。
So welcome again, and yeah, parents already settled.。
So as I mentioned, we are in our month, our January fasting month.。
So this is the third week we are coming into.。
And then next week, technically it's the 21st day.。
And on that day, we will break our fast together, celebrate together.。
We can share how the Holy Spirit works on us individually and actually properly as a church.。
So that's why we have the fasting as church.。
So on that day, 28th January, we will have lunch of course, fast for a 21 days.。
So we decided to have a good lunch all together.。
So you can still fast in the morning, but during the lunchtime, that's the best time for us to connect one another.。
And also we can share life.。
We will set tables there.。
You can have your own food, bring to us so that we can enjoy together the community time.。
Is it good?。
Yes.。
Bring your own lunch.。
And then next week, we will bring our own senior pastor.。
Andrew Gardner, yeah, from Wan Chai.。
Yeah, he will come to speak to us, to have a message to preach.。
So in Cantonese service and also English service.。
So that day, yeah, next week, we can like have the fellowship time all together after the service.。
And yeah, very important.。
It's not just for our own sake, right?。
We enjoy our community time, but also Jesus called us to send his gospel.。
So we regularly will have a program called ALVA.。
That's a very good tool for us to share our faith and also connect people to church.。
So we have a video.。
Why don't we first watch the video, and then I will share a little bit more with you all.。
Having conversations about life, faith, and Jesus is hard.。
And this is interesting, because at some point, everyone wrestles with life's big questions.。
Questions about hope, purpose, meaning, and love.。
Imagine creating a space where people in our community, our friends, neighbors, and coworkers, can come and have conversations in a way that is authentic and unforced.。
Where leaders don't need to have all the answers, and anyone can ask tough questions and share honestly about what they believe.。
That's what ALVA is all about.。
ALVA started in a church in London years ago with a simple idea to engage friends who might not typically go to church.。
Lives were transformed, and it began to grow all over the world.。
Today, you can find ALVA in schools, coffee shops, church buildings, prisons, and homes.。
And so far, millions of people have experienced ALVA.。
So what is ALVA?。
ALVA is a series of interactive sessions exploring the basics of the Christian faith.。
In each session, you eat food, listen to a talk, and have discussions in small groups.。
Eating food together creates space for people to connect, relax, and build friendships.。
The talks tackle core questions about life and faith from a Christian perspective.。
And the discussion allows people to unpack these ideas without fear of being corrected or judged.。
All of this is done in a fun environment where anyone is welcome.。
It is typically run over 8 to 12 weeks, with a weekend away where there are opportunities to experience worship through music and moments for prayer.。
By running ALVA, you're creating a space where people can connect with each other and connect with God.。
Sign up, get started, run ALVA today.。
Yes, sign up, run ALVA together.。
So I want to ask, who has joined ALVA before?。
Wow, you are one of millions.。
So there are millions waiting for us as well.。
They have not yet joined ALVA.。
So I invite you all to invite your friends.。
We have won twice ALVA in our church.。
And just a few months ago, we won ALVA right here.。
It's so good, so amazing.。
And there's a lot of space.。
We can invite more people to join.。
So I invite you guys to invite your friends and family to come.。
And I saw that there are many hands.。
So you have joined ALVA, so you can serve ALVA as well.。
But if for those who haven't joined ALVA before, you also can serve.。
We have a lot of, like, a few different roles to serve ALVA.。
So that's why we have a training on 4 February.。
Then we have a one-off training so that we can equip you all, come together.。
We have one spirit altogether.。
And then we can serve ALVA to bring gospel to our neighborhood.。
And on 21st, the week right after Chinese New Year,。
there's a good start for us to winning ALVA.。
So, yeah, enjoy ALVA together, join and win ALVA together.。
So sounds good.。
And if you would like to scan it later,。
our digital signage is always ready for your before and after service.。
So we can well use of that digital signage as well.。
And now is the time for us to have our offering.。
So I invite our welcome team to pass around the packet.。
We have a lot of way to serve and worship God.。
We can serve as a church, worship team, production team, K4C.。
We can serve as bring gospel to other in ALVA.。
We also can serve by the action of giving.。
That's why we always mention offering is part of worship。
because that how we really use our whole to worship God.。
And that is a very good opportunity for us to, like from our heart,。
to ask God, ask the Holy Spirit, "Oh, what do you want us to give?"。
We can give out in different way, different amount,。
in physicality, digitally, and also maybe serving.。
So why don't we just pray?。
Yeah, let us pray for our offering altogether.。
Father, we thank you for giving us this opportunity,。
this great opportunity to contribute to your kingdom.。
Yeah, thank you for your spirit to let us know how do we respond.。
We are not asked by anyone, but we are called by you。
so that our giving, our contribution is used by you in your kingdom.。
So Lord, may you use it, receive it, and move us。
so that we are so thankful to join this in this way,。
to join your work in this city, in your kingdom.。
We are praying in Jesus' name. Amen.。
So today we have our lead pastor, Pastor Tim, to give us a message.。
So let us welcome Pastor Tim to come to stage.。
Yeah, why don't we stretch out our hand to pray for Pastor Tim。
before he gives our message.。
Father, we thank you for your ways of your leader to lead us.。
And also you anoint Pastor Tim today to speak to us。
how we worship you personally.。
And we thank you for how you lead us to worship you properly.。
But now you open our heart and ear to listen to your words。
so that we can respond with our action.。
We pray that in Jesus' name. Amen.。
Hey, earlier I was taking back to my college days,。
Shout to the Lord.。
So it's been quite a while.。
But that actually was a song where I fell in love with worshiping.。
And for me that was very special.。
So thank you so much for bringing this to us this morning,。
you know, to worship God in that way.。
Now, talking about university, while I was at university,。
I had a friend, a great friend, even to this day a good friend,。
who checked in on me.。
He asked, "Tim, how are you doing?"。
And I was doing okay, la, you know, it was okay.。
And then he, I said, "I'm okay."。
And he's like, "What's wrong?"。
I was like, "What do you mean what's wrong? I'm okay."。
"No, something's wrong, Tim. You should be happy.。
Jesus was always happy."。
I was like, kind of caught off guard and thinking,。
I was like, "No, surely Jesus wasn't always happy."。
I was like, "What about when he died on the cross?"。
And so that kind of ended the conversation.。
And we're still friends today, so it didn't end the friendship.。
But as I was reflecting on that,。
there was something in me just saying that I was okay,。
or him perceiving that I was not doing good,。
where it brought him discomfort.。
He felt like it was not right.。
And that's a type of misguided spirituality,。
where you think when you're a Christian,。
you always need to be happy.。
You always need to feel great.。
And even if you're not feeling great,。
you have to pretend like you're feeling great.。
And it can also have this toxic faith element,。
where you believe, "If I have faith, then I will not suffer.。
I will have no pain. I will have no difficulties."。
And so that somehow flowed into this conversation.。
Now, besides misguided spiritualities,。
actually our culture is not comfortable with pain,。
with suffering, and with grief.。
I remember in the US, you walk around,。
you say, "Hey, what's up? How's it going?"。
"Great!"。
And if you ever actually answer that,。
"Really, how are you feeling?"。
People are like, "I don't want to hear that, man.。
I just want to hear you're great,。
and I want to move on with my life."。
Right?。
So, even within our culture,。
there is this comfort, "Don't be a downer.。
Don't rain on my party."。
And so we're stuck with these feelings of grief,。
of pain, of difficulty, of sorrow.。
And we feel like we're not allowed to express them,。
and maybe we even feel shame for them.。
And so then we're not sure,。
"Can I bring this to my friends?。
Do they even want to hear about this?"。
Or maybe they want to hear about it once,。
but they don't want to hear about it a second,。
the third, the fourth, the fifth time.。
"Can I bring this to my Christian community?"。
Or do they also reflect culture,。
and don't want to hear about it。
after they prayed about it once,。
they feel like it should be settled?。
"Can I bring it to God?"。
Or is this a part of my life。
that I need to hide from God。
because I somehow feel,。
or my environment has told me,。
that I always need to be joyful。
and feel great and happy,。
and then when I struggle,。
it's a part that God does not want to hear.。
And this leads us to,。
a lot of times we don't actually know。
what to do with our pain.。
We don't know what to do with our suffering.。
We don't know what to do with our agony,。
with the things that we're carrying around in our hearts.。
And I just wonder this morning,。
who here woke up with tears this morning?。
Who went last night as you were laying in bed,。
was feeling sorrow?。
I think it's quite a few.。
I don't think it's just like one, two people.。
What sort of pain have you been carrying around?。
Maybe it's even from a long time ago,。
where this is just this thing。
that just has not gone away.。
What do we do with that?。
What I want to do with you this morning is,。
I want to explore with you a question.。
And the question is this.。
How can we bring our sorrows and our grief。
and pain before God?。
What does God's word teach about that?。
How are we supposed to process that?。
So today we're continuing in our message series,。
Fresh Encounter.。
We have been looking at fasting.。
So we also are doing this fast together,。
which I don't know about you,。
for me this has been very encouraging.。
I love doing that together.。
I feel really strengthened。
when I get to do this with other people.。
And I've experienced God in a deeper way in the season.。
I hope that is your experience as well.。
Then last week we talked about prayer.。
And we looked at Jesus,。
how Jesus encouraged the disciples to come and pray.。
And he encouraged the disciples with God's goodness,。
that we have a loving father who loves。
giving good things to the children who ask.。
And today our topic is personal worship.。
Now, one thing that we also want to do during the season is,。
if you've been in church,。
some of us have been in church for a while,。
some of us might never have been much in church.。
But if you've been in church for a while,。
it's easy to get stuck in a rut.。
Like to get stuck in routines, how we relate to God.。
But God wants to encounter us in fresh ways.。
We don't want to talk about experience from 5 or 10 years ago.。
We want to experience Jesus here and now.。
Because he's alive and he's moving and he's at work.。
So as I was thinking about personal worship,。
now the first thing that didn't come to mind。
was talking about pain and sorrow and grief.。
That's actually the last thing that came to mind.。
But I want to, first of all, I want to share with you a practice。
that is known as the prayer of lament.。
And then afterwards I want to talk a little bit more about。
why I concluded that as we're talking about personal worship,。
to talk about the prayer of lament.。
So here's a definition of the prayer of lament.。
A lament is a complaint to God.。
Yes, the Bible tells us it is okay to complain to God.。
And it shows us how to do that.。
It's a prayers of lament offer a way to approach God,。
acknowledge our circumstances,。
and the genuine feelings of sadness, grief, frustration, sorrow, and fear。
that overwhelm and consume us.。
Lamenting is an act of faith。
that calls upon God for transformation and redemption.。
Now what does personal worship have to do with lamenting?。
Well, for me, personal worship is really bringing all of our lives。
before all of who God is.。
It's bringing all of our, in every facet of our lives,。
showing our devotion to him.。
And that means that we also do that in the painful parts of our life,。
that we show our devotion to him,。
that we come before him and bring the sorrows, the pains,。
the struggling, the agony to the one who loves us。
and who can really do something about what we're experiencing.。
And I personally find when we engage with God。
in the most difficult times of our lives,。
that it is some of the deepest and most powerful worship there is.。
I was earlier moved, I assume you too, when Henriette,。
you heard what has happened, and she's up here,。
and she is leading us in worship.。
Now that's deep worship.。
That's not easy worship, but that's deep and real worship.。
When our times are tough and we're choosing to come before God。
with whatever is going on, that's an act of faith and it's an act of praise.。
Now today we are in the Book of Psalms.。
Now there is personal laments, there's also corporate laments.。
So the Bible actually teaches us how we can engage in this complaining to God.。
So we didn't just come up with that because we felt like it,。
actually God's Word leads us in that,。
and it shows us how we can do that individually,。
but it also shows us how we can do that corporately。
because sometimes there's things as a society,。
as a group of people that we are lamenting,。
that we are crying out to God for.。
But today we're going to look at a personal lament.。
We're going to look at Psalm 6.。
And Psalm 6 is attributed to King David.。
Now the Psalms is the prayer and the worship book of Israel,。
of Jesus, and of the church.。
Jesus actually, when he was on the cross, he prayed a lament.。
Psalm 22, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"。
It's a psalm.。
So Jesus was led by the Psalms,。
even how to bring his agony and his grief and his pain to the Father.。
And so we're going to see how the psalm invites us to bring those things that are heavy,。
where a lot of times we don't know what to do,。
to the God, and to see how God meets us when we do that.。
So we're in Psalm 6, and starting in verse 1 it says this,。
"Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, or discipline me in your wrath.。
Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint.。
Heal me, Lord, my bones are in agony.。
My soul is in deep anguish.。
How long? How long?。
How often?。
How often?。
When we go through painful and difficult things,。
there's a thought that comes up in our hearts and minds,。
and we wonder, "Is somehow God angry at us?。
Is he somehow disciplining us or punishing us?"。
And we wonder about that.。
I don't know if you've ever thought of that.。
I have thought of that.。
I have thought of that as I've gone through painful experiences.。
Is God somehow disciplining me?。
Is there a sin that I need to confess, something that I need to sort out?。
And sometimes there might be, you know, where there's something we need to work out,。
but a lot of times we just don't know.。
And we feel like maybe there's a distance, and we're just wondering what's going on.。
Well, here in the Psalm, David, he doesn't confess any very specific sin.。
He does that in others where he's clear.。
So it seems that David is like, "Lord, I don't know if I did something wrong.。
Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.。
Take this away. This burden is too heavy."。
The psalmist describes the circumstances.。
"For I am faint. My bones are in agony.。
My soul is in deep anguish."。
Now, throughout the Psalms, pain and suffering is described as physical suffering and pain.。
But it doesn't mean that it just refers to physical suffering and pain.。
Actually, a lot of times it's used as a metaphor to also talk about emotional suffering and pain.。
And so we actually don't know the circumstance that triggered this pain and suffering in David's life.。
If it's an illness or if it's something emotional, something else has happened.。
We don't know.。
But this is a cry, "I can't take it any longer.。
Do something.。
My circumstances, they're weighing me down and they're crushing me.。
How long?。
How long?"。
Now, that's the cry of someone who is at the end of the ropes.。
But it is also the cry of someone who is hoping God will act.。
So by crying out to God and asking God how long, David is expressing his hope,。
even if it is a faint hope, that God can step in and change his circumstances.。
So I lament as a complaint to God, as a complaint to the one we believe。
who can actually do something about what's going on.。
And this element of hope is important because when we cry out,。
we come to the one who can actually help.。
We come to the one who can meet us and deliver us,。
who can show us mercy, who can lift us out of whatever difficulty it is that we're facing.。
Now, ultimately, this is a plea for God's mercy.。
You see it in verse 2, "Have mercy on me."。
There's an Old Testament professor I like, and he comments on this verse.。
He says this, "When people in life are against us,。
we have nothing to turn to but God's generosity,。
his grace, his mercy, his love.。
He's the one that delivers us. He's the one that meets us.。
He's the one that has the power to bring us out, to bring us through,。
to sustain us when we are weak, when we have nothing left in our tank.。
Let's continue. Verse 4, "Turn, Lord, and deliver me.。
Save me because of your unfailing love.。
Among the dead, no one proclaims your name.。
Who praises you from this grave?"。
Now, the word that's translated as "turn,"。
actually a more literal translation is "return."。
So David is saying, "Return to me, Lord."。
He feels like God has abandoned him.。
He feels like he's on his own.。
"Return to me."。
And he also appeals to God's love, to his unfailing love.。
So when we lament, we also call on who God is and who he promises to be.。
God promises his covenant people, which is also us as Christians,。
we're in the new covenant, that he loves us, that he's with us, that he's faithful.。
And so we call on this, "Lord, you say you're faithful.。
You love us. Do something.。
Show me that this is real." That's what we're saying.。
And verse 5 kind of cracks me up,。
because David is making an argument why God should deliver him.。
He's basically saying, "I'm dead. Who can praise you?。
What good is it? You're going to lose some praise.。
So keep me alive."。
Let's continue in verse 6.。
"I'm worn out from groaning.。
All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.。
My eyes grow weak with sorrow.。
They fail because of all my foes."。
So right now the psalmist, or David, is describing just what he's been experiencing.。
It's also part of lamenting.。
We describe what we're experiencing, what we're feeling, what's been happening.。
And he says that he is worn out from groaning.。
I remember being in Calcutta.。
I volunteered at the home of the dying for Mother Teresa.。
It's like 20 years ago.。
And this hall was full of people who were in their last stage of their lives.。
And Mother Teresa had organized this space so that people do not die on their own,。
that they do die with dignity, that there's somebody with them,。
somebody caring for them, somebody who softens their pain.。
And I remember when I stepped in there, I mean the hall was full of groaning.。
Just worn out from the suffering of the sickness, the illness.。
I also am reminded of my father when he had cancer and he passed away in 2007.。
Just the groaning when the tumors were growing and pushing on nerves.。
So David's saying, "I'm worn out, Lord.。
I've got nothing.。
I have nothing.。
I'm an empty."。
And then it talks about the weeping and the crying.。
Now I don't know if you've had this experience.。
At night time, things settle down, we're not as busy, we're not as distracted.。
And then the stuff comes up that we're carrying.。
And then the tears start flowing.。
We start weeping.。
I've had that.。
I went through a difficult, the most difficult experience of my life, 2017.。
And almost every night I was weeping.。
Every night tears were flowing.。
And so we described to God what's going on.。
Well, what's amazing when we do that, He's not scared of what we're experiencing.。
He's not scared of what we're feeling.。
He's not scared of our complaint.。
God can handle it.。
He invites us to do that.。
People might get uncomfortable.。
God does not get uncomfortable with your pain, with your suffering, with your struggles, with whatever's going on.。
God is a sympathetic listener.。
He becomes a partner in our suffering.。
By lamenting, we move from feeling we are alone to being in dialogue with God about what is going on.。
So instead of carrying around whatever is going on in ourselves, now we're starting to bring it to God.。
That's actually part of the healing process, just being heard.。
Just putting name, naming what we've been experiencing, putting a name to it.。
And we can trust that God understands our pain, that He understands our suffering.。
We can know that because of Jesus.。
Pastor Ivan earlier read a scripture, talked about sharing the suffering of Jesus.。
Jesus was betrayed by one of His disciples, so He knows betrayal.。
He was abandoned by His disciples, where they all just left Him.。
He was spat on, He was beaten, He was ridiculed.。
He was physically, ultimately put to death.。
So He understands your emotional and your physical suffering, because He has gone through it.。
He understands.。
A lot of times in some of my experience I felt nobody understands me.。
But God understands you.。
But He also went through that, dying on the cross and rising from the dead to lead us out of the suffering.。
To turn things around, so that we can experience His healing, His forgiveness, His new life that He gives.。
And this is something that He can give now.。
Earlier as we were praying, I had this vision of Jesus walking around this room, laying hands on people's shoulders.。
Just doing healing work in people's lives.。
Just praying over us as a community.。
So Jesus, He loves releasing His healing and His restoration of people.。
And there are some things where God's Word also promises that they might not get fixed on this side of our lives.。
But we have a promise that one day God will set, for those who believe in Him, for those who trust Him, He will set everything right.。
That there will be no more tears, there will be no more pain, no more suffering.。
You can read Revelation 21.。
Now there's a psalm that I came across.。
Interesting enough, it even came up in my personal reading.。
Psalm 56, verse 8.。
It says this, "You keep track of all my sorrows.。
You have collected all my tears in your bottle.。
You have recorded each one in your book."。
God does not miss a single tear that has flowed down your face.。
Not a single one.。
That's how attentive He is to you.。
In verse 7 it also says, "My eyes grow weak with sorrow."。
Now what this means when the Psalms talk about eyes growing weak, it has to do with that they've been looking for God.。
They've been waiting on God.。
But they're growing tired of looking out.。
So it's another called God act.。
My eyes are, I can't look much longer.。
And then to add injury to suffering, suddenly in verse 7, there's also enemies that pop up that have smart things to say to us while we're suffering.。
Maybe it's blaming you for what's going on.。
People always try to explain suffering.。
And then they try to find fault somewhere.。
And so a lot of times they put the fault on the person who's going through the suffering.。
Maybe it's somebody taking advantage of you while you're suffering.。
Maybe in your job or elsewhere.。
So this just adds.。
But let's continue reading in verse 8.。
It says this, "Away from me, all you who do evil.。
For the Lord has heard my weeping.。
The Lord has heard my cry for mercy.。
The Lord accepts my prayer.。
All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish.。
They will turn back and suddenly be put to shame."。
So suddenly God's unfailing love, this love that David called for in verse 4, breaks into the situation.。
David has been hurt.。
God has heard the complaint.。
He has heard the mourning.。
And that changes everything.。
This is a turnaround.。
This is a turning point.。
Now we don't know how much time has passed between the lamenting and this line.。
A lot of times, sometimes God meets us immediately.。
Sometimes there's a longer period.。
But don't be discouraged.。
Jesus is at work underneath the surface.。
He is working.。
Don't lose hope.。
Hold on.。
He's at work in your life.。
And then suddenly, you know, His word will break through, His assurance.。
We don't know what happened.。
Did God speak to David?。
Did somebody have a word for him, come for him?。
Was he encouraged through some of scripture?。
We don't know.。
Now I've had an experience like that.。
I shared earlier that I've gone through a very difficult time.。
And I went to, attended a church and was worshipping.。
And I was stuck.。
I did not know how to move forward in my life.。
I -- my life had come to a sudden halt.。
I was hopeless.。
I just really did not know what to do.。
And I really didn't care even what happened to me at that point.。
And so as I was worshipping, I had a word from Jesus.。
And I've shared this here before.。
I'm not finished with you yet.。
But I felt like He was.。
I felt like it was over.。
He said, "I'm not finished with you yet."。
Now, were all my problems resolved in that moment?。
No.。
I still was in the same situation, but I was heard.。
Because God had spoken to me in my lamenting and my crying and in my worshipping Him.。
And it released hope and courage to move forward.。
Suddenly my perspective had changed.。
And then God bit by bit turned my life around and just poured His goodness and His love on me.。
So this is the transformative part.。
When we bring our pains, our complaints, our sorrows to God in a prayer of lament,。
that God, one way or another, at one point or another, that He meets us, that He speaks to us,。
that He provides for us what we need to move forward,。
to know His steadfast love in the circumstances that we're facing,。
to know that He is going to see us through.。
Now, at the beginning of the message, I asked the question,。
"How can we bring our sorrows, grief and pain before God?"。
Well, the Bible gives us the prayers of lament to show us how to do that.。
And so we've seen that we can bring our complaints to Him.。
Now, I want to share with you five steps of how can I do it, how can I lament, what do I do?。
Just very simple.。
And this might be something that you use as you pray.。
This might be something you journal on.。
So can we -- yes, thank you.。
So the first one is a lament is addressed to God.。
We're talking to God.。
The second one is we bring our complaint.。
We say what's wrong and what's frustrating.。
We just say it.。
And this is not about being theologically correct.。
You just say it.。
You just put it out there.。
And then we tell God what we want from Him, what we want Him to do.。
And then we describe your situation of distress, your weeping, your sorrow, your struggling.。
Whatever it is, you just put it out there.。
And then we end with a statement of trust, whatever that might be.。
"Lord, I believe that You still love me.。
I believe that You will meet me in this.。
I believe it."。
We just end with a statement of trust.。
So those are five ways that we see in a psalm that we can lament, that we can pour our hearts to God,。
and how the Bible teaches us to engage with those deep sorrows and pains that we're facing.。
And I want to ask the worship team to come up.。
And God wants to encounter us in fresh ways, something new.。
That's what the series is about.。
And God can do something new in our lives.。
And He invites us today to bring to Him our sorrow, our grief.。
So I want to do a ministry time.。
I'll explain what we're going to do.。
If you're experiencing something difficult, maybe something that's been going on for a very long time,。
it's just still there, I want to invite you to stretch out your hand before.。
I want to actually invite everyone to stand.。
Maybe it's something, maybe it's just been tears this week.。
Whatever it is, I want to invite you to stretch out your hands.。
And then one thing that God gives us is also community.。
I want to invite those in the community, if you see somebody with your hand stretched out as a sign of God's love,。
will you just gently place your hand on their shoulder and just pray over them?。
So we're going to do this.。
We're going to pray over each other just for a few minutes, and then we'll go into worship.。
So let's do that right now.。
Let's lift each other up in prayer.。
