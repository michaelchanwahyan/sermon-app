It begins in the emptiness of nothingness, where darkness has extinguished even the memory。
of light, where nothingness and emptiness tear space into fragments and everything is。
nothing at all.。
It starts here, where fear shackles and failure persists, where slavery binds and oppression。
persists, it starts here, in the place you least expect, suddenly, a light.。
Dancing to be noticed, within the empire of darkness, crackling with beginnings, restless。
with life, as if the emptiness had simply been waiting for divine direction.。
It starts here.。
Shadows now play against the walls of death, movement and memory and miracles and might,。
breaking into nothingness with the heresy of possibility, shaming the darkness with。
the creation of hope.。
It starts here.。
A drawing out, a calling forth, a voice in the wilderness, a wilderness of voices, whispers。
of freedom, bushes on fire, a journey beyond, ascending to glory.。
It starts here, in the emptiness of nothingness, in the slavery and oppression, in the fear。
and the failure and the pharaohs in us all.。
May you see what heaven is stirring.。
For a light has come and a light is coming, death now dead, bushes now burning, yes a。
light has come and a light is coming, death now dead, bushes now burning.。
[Music]。
