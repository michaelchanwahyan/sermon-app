Hello, I am Wong Kwok Wai。
Director of the Chinese Academy of Psychiatry。
and a pastor of the Catholic Church。
Today I would like to introduce a book。
called "Alone Together"。
It is translated from Chinese to Japanese。
and is called "在一起孤獨"。
The author is Sherry Turco。
She studied psychology and psychology。
in the United States in the 1970s。
She started her research in the US。
in the 70s。
She studied the relationship between people。
and the internet and computers。
that were developed over time。
In the early 70s and 80s。
when the internet and computers were popular。
she was very excited。
She thought that people could communicate。
with each other in a large number of ways。
and that it would help human relations。
But when she continued to do research。
she found that it was not necessarily the case。
She found that today。
especially when it is convenient to communicate by mobile phone。
or by short message。
it may be a negative influence on us。
In fact, we often think that technology is a tool。
like I use it, it won't affect us。
But it is not。
Let's see。
If we have a tool。
we use it a lot。
our hands will get numb。
And we will find that technology。
is also a potential impact on our culture。
For example。
before the bell。
when was the time to go to class。
when was the time to finish the teacher's speech。
When he finished his speech。
when he finished what he wanted to say。
But how do we decide today。
when the worship is over。
We just look at the bell。
So we find that the emergence of technology。
is affecting our culture。
So this author's research。
especially in the field of communication。
tells us。
how our human relations。
are affected by mobile phones and short messages。
Simply put, she found that。
these short messages and communications。
let us put people around us。
or the objects we communicate with。
in a very safe place。
What does it mean?。
I can touch it。
But it won't get close to a place。
that is affecting me。
Maybe everyone will do this in a short message。
I can touch it。
But it may be very simple。
Do I need to see it。
to see its eyebrows?。
It's not very useful。
So we are very comfortable。
We can put it in a place where we can touch it。
The author's point is to connect it。
But he said。
As time goes by。
especially the younger generation。
have less chance to meet people and talk to them。
They don't know how to look at people's eyebrows。
or respond to them。
They don't know how to communicate with people。
He said。
We know how to connect with people。
but we don't know how to communicate with people。
But he also observed one thing。
It turns out that people。
have a deep relationship with others。
It's very important。
So he said。
What phenomenon will technology bring?。
We are looking forward to having a deep communication with people。
But we are not very good at doing things。
because of the influence of technology。
It brings such an impact。
I especially like。
This author is not a Christian。
But the results of his research。
are very consistent with what the Bible says。
The Bible says。
Loneliness is a bad thing。
Lonely。
So God wants to solve loneliness。
Maybe he uses a lot of animals in the beginning。
to see if he can be his companion。
But it doesn't work。
God eventually has to be a man。
And we immediately find that。
it is a very troublesome thing。
Maybe God requires a lot from us。
Maybe God has a lot of restrictions。
It is very difficult for us to love each other。
But according to this author。
if we only put our relationship with others。
in a state of "I am comfortable"。
and "It's for my own good"。
it is not a very satisfactory relationship。
Let's go back to the Bible。
God bestowed the cross to Adam。
But in the end, everyone committed a crime。
and it was very troublesome。
The interesting thing is。
our interpersonal relationship。
may teach us that。
yes, love each other。
It may be very troublesome to。
hold on to someone I don't like。
But the richness of our life。
our love for each other。
can be obtained in these relationships。
So I think this book is very open。
If you have time to read it。
I hope you will like it。
