Hello, everyone。
My name is Lee Tien-kwan。
I am a teacher at the Catholic Academy of the Holy See。
I teach systematic theology。
Today I would like to introduce a book。
about the study of the Five Elements。
Many people have asked me。
what books to introduce。
when I teach or share this topic。
So today I would like to introduce a book。
that is often referred to as "church"。
in the Chinese language。
or "theology"。
Today I would like to introduce a book。
that is based on the study of the Five Elements。
or even a broader study。
of the Five Elements, called "Pentecostalism"。
It is a broader study。
and is not often mentioned in the Chinese language。
This book is called "Global Pentecostalism"。
The title is。
"The New Phase of Christian Social Engagement"。
It is written by two scholars。
They are not members of the Five Elements。
One is Donald E. Mueller。
He studies religious and social science。
The other is Ted Yamamori。
He is an NGO that deals with poverty。
When the two of them work together。
they want to conduct research。
on developing countries。
especially on Christian churches。
that are developing rapidly。
and have no police support。
but are active in serving society。
and even bringing about social transformation。
in the church。
In their research。
they found that 85% of the churches。
were the Five Elements and the Holy Spirit。
So they changed the title of the book。
to "Pentecostalism"。
The book is based on。
the study of the Five Elements。
in a global way。
Because when we study the Five Elements。
or the Pentecostalism。
especially in the Chinese language。
we use the "three-wave theory"。
We say that the United States is the center。
and the "made in USA" is the direction。
But today many people。
are looking at it from a global perspective。
They found that。
the Pentecostalism。
is not only the development of the United States。
the development of the "one, two, three waves"。
but also the development of different revival movements。
in the world。
So they divided the groups。
into five major groups。
The first group is the classical Pentecostalism。
which is the five-fold tradition。
The second group is the individualistic。
but five-fold-style。
or the local-style。
or the local-style。
or the local-style。
The third group is the spiritual movement。
or the third-wave-influenced。
or the third-wave-influenced。
The fourth group is the individualistic。
but the five-fold-style。
or the local-style。
The fifth group is very special。
It is very rare to see。
It is a group of individual believers。
who participated in a special meeting。
and had spiritual experience。
Because of this experience。
they also had many faith-filled activities。
From a global perspective。
it is a rich study of the three-wave theory。
of the Pentecostalism。
Especially the local churches。
which are not influenced by the West。
This is a great criticism of the three-wave theory。
The second feature is that。
this book is studied by non-Pentecostalists。
or the people of the Bible。
They mainly use cross-scientific research。
especially religious psychology。
The study of the three-wave theory。
shows us a broader direction of the Pentecostalism。
especially in the university。
not limited to the diocese or church。
There are also many scientific integrations。
They use social theories。
such as Marx, Jurgen, Sigmund Freud。
to study the three-wave theory。
Of course, the authors。
or the two authors。
emphasize that。
these social theories。
often weaken religious phenomena。
But from their perspective。
I think they have a breakthrough。
In addition to social theories。
they also use the email theorem。
to study worship。
and how to integrate the whole community。
into a single theory。
They are also careful。
to avoid neglecting。
or denying some supernatural works。
This is a key point or breakthrough。
in their research。
This book emphasizes。
the Christian social engagement。
As I said。
85% of the church。
is Pentecostal and spiritual。
In fact, it means。
that many of our understanding of the Pentecostalism。
is based on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit。
or they emphasize the aspect of the Holy Spirit。
But today, from a global perspective。
when we look at this data。
they are not conservative。
Christian believers。
They are very involved in society。
and participate in the transformation of society。
So in this book。
they call these Christian believers。
or Pentecostal believers。
"progressive Pentecostalism"。
which means they are progressive。
or they are believers who are in favor of Pentecostalism。
This is a new perspective。
of the Pentecostalism research。
and the Pentecostalism church。
It is very interesting。
It compares the Pentecostalism。
with the Pentecostalism in Latin America。
There is a quote。
that I think is worth reading。
It says。
"Liberation theology opted for the poor。
at the same time that the poor were opting for Pentecostalism"。
In fact, it says。
that in Latin America。
the reformation of society was the doctrine of the Holy Spirit。
But in the public sphere。
many people's needs。
whether they are sick。
or in economic need。
are not satisfied by the doctrine of the Holy Spirit。
but by the Five-Day Feast。
or the Church of the Holy Spirit。
Their social programs。
such as orphanages, medical care。
social support。
and even job hunting。
have been extended to。
Protestant ethics。
Pentecostal ethics。
and many other economic topics。
which are also very important。
in the Five-Day Feast。
Here you can see。
the uniqueness of this book。
At the end, there are two bullet points。
The first bullet point is that。
this book is very special。
It introduces Hong Kong。
Of course, when these two authors。
visited Hong Kong and Singapore。
they were a bit skeptical。
whether they were developing countries。
But they did research on these churches。
They studied the Church of the Holy Spirit。
the Pentecostal Church。
At first, they were a bit skeptical。
But gradually they found that。
they did not want to establish an organization。
but to lead by the Holy Spirit。
So they did not need to raise funds。
They did not want to establish a church。
but to build a group of people。
who love each other because of God's love。
This made them very optimistic。
Of course, they also visited a pastor。
in Hong Kong to explain the doctrine。
The pastor was a PhD student。
in an important Canadian school。
Of course, he was not a pastor of the Five-Day Feast。
But he saw that there were many new ideas。
about the Five-Day Feast。
This is also a very important point。
in this book。
Of course, they also visited the Holy See。
the Holy See in the Central Park。
So this is worth mentioning。
The second bullet point is that。
if you are interested in the Five-Day Feast。
you can read two more extended translations。
The first is the "Pentecostalism" published in 1997。
This is a global study of the Five-Day Feast。
It has already broken the "Three-Wheel Theory"。
It was published in 1997。
The other one is a new one。
It is a handbook on Pentecostal theology。
This book is very good。
because it covers almost all the topics。
of the Five-Day Feast。
Each chapter is written by a research expert。
or a book expert。
It is only about ten pages。
You can understand the whole topic。
It is very worth reading。
I hope that when you are interested in Pentecostalism。
you can read the above book。
Thank you。
