Hey porch, join me as we read God's word together.。
From the Gospel of Luke chapter 8 verses 26 through 39.。
Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.。
When Jesus had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons.。
For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but among the。
tombs.。
When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, "What。
have you to do with me, Jesus, son of the most high God?。
I beg you, do not torment me."。
For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.。
For many a time it had seized him.。
He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds。
and be driven by the demon into the desert.。
Jesus then asked him, "What is your name?"。
And he said, "Legion."。
For many demons had entered him.。
And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss.。
Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let。
them enter these.。
So he gave them permission.。
Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep。
bank into the lake and drowned.。
When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.。
Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from。
whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and。
they were afraid.。
And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.。
Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerizim asked him to depart from them,。
for they were seized with great fear.。
So he got into the boat and returned.。
The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent。
him away, saying, "Return to your home and declare how much God has done for you."。
And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him."。
Now our fifth message in our series called "Disciple."。
[Applause]。
>> PORCH, HOW WE DOIN'?。
WE DOIN' OKAY TONIGHT?。
[Cheers]。
HEY, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YA.。
THANKS SO MUCH FOR MAKING TIME TO BE BACK WITH US THIS EVENING.。
SPECIAL SHOUT-OUT TO ALL OF OUR PORCH LIVE LOCATIONS.。
LOVE WHAT GOD'S DOING AROUND THE NATION.。
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT, THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE HERE IN DALLAS, BUT THERE'S A。
SPECIAL SHOUT-OUT TO PORCH LIVE SPRINGFIELD, MIDLAND, AND BOISE, IDAHO.。
LOVE IT.。
HEY, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD, BUT ON MARCH 20TH OF THIS YEAR, HISTORY WAS MADE AS CHRIS。
BROWN IS THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE PORCH LIVE.。
HE'S THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE PORCH LIVE.。
HE'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE PORCH LIVE.。
HE'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE PORCH LIVE.。
HISTORY WAS MADE AS CHRIS BROWN, NOT SEA BREEZY, BUT A MODERN EXPLORER FROM YORKSHIRE,。
ENGLAND, JOURNEYED TO ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE PLACES IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.。
HE MADE HIS WAY TO POINT NEMO.。
POINT NEMO IS INFAMOUSLY KNOWN AS THE LONELIEST LOCATION ON THE PLANET.。
BECAUSE POINT NEMO IS FARTHER AWAY FROM ANY SINGLE LANDMASS THAN ANY OTHER SPOT IN THE。
ENTIRE GLOBE.。
IT'S LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC.。
AND WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT POINT NEMO IS THAT IT IS KNOWN AS THE OCEANIC POINT OF INACCESSIBILITY.。
ANYBODY IS SUPPOSED TO GET THERE.。
IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO REACH.。
AND THE CLOSEST HUMANS NEARBY TO POINT NEMO ARE NOT IN FACT ON PLANET EARTH.。
THEY ARE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AS IT FLOATS IN ORBIT ABOVE THE LOCATION.。
POINT NEMO IS ALSO KNOWN AS AN INTERGALACTIC DUMPING ZONE.。
IT'S WHERE NATIONS WILL DISCARD SPACECRAFT BECAUSE IT IS SO WILDLY REMOTE TO THE REST。
OF CIVILIZATION.。
AND YET CHRIS BROWN DECIDED TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.。
GO WHERE NO MAN HAD GONE BEFORE.。
AFTER FIVE YEARS WORTH OF PLANNING, 21 DAYS OF JOURNEYING, AND STANDING 1600 MILES FROM。
THE NEAREST SHORELINE, HE FOUND HIMSELF NOT JUST IN A BOAT, BUT SWIMMING AT POINT NEMO.。
WHEN ASKED WHY DID YOU DO IT, CHRIS VERY SIMPLY SAID, "I'M AN ADVENTURER AT HEART.。
I GO PLACES NO ONE ELSE WILL."。
WHY DO I TELL YOU THAT?。
BECAUSE JESUS CHRIST AND CHRIS BROWN, THE EXPLORER, HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.。
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT JESUS DOESN'T GO PLACES NO ONE ELSE WILL.。
HE MOVES TOWARDS PEOPLE THAT NO ONE ELSE WILL.。
JESUS MOVES TOWARDS THE LONELIEST IN LIFE.。
HE JOURNEYS TO REACH THE MOST INACCESSIBLE IN OUR WORLD.。
HE WANTS TO REACH THE MOST ISOLATED OF ALL.。
AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE SEEKS TONIGHT.。
SO IF YOU HAVE A BIBLE, YOU CAN TURN WITH ME TO LUKE CHAPTER 8.。
LUKE CHAPTER 8.。
JUST TO CATCH YOU UP, WE HAVE BEEN IN A SERIES CALLED DISCIPLE WHERE WE'VE BEEN ASKING THE。
QUESTION WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO REALLY FOLLOW JESUS?。
WHICH FEELS LIKE A PRETTY OBVIOUS QUESTION TO ANSWER.。
MANY OF US, WE WOULD ASSUME THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER TO THAT IS.。
AND YET, IF WE REALLY GOT UNDERNEATH WHAT WE BELIEVE IT MEANS TO FOLLOW JESUS, WE'D。
PROBABLY FIND SOME THINGS LIKE IT MEANS BEING A GOOD PERSON AND GOING TO CHURCH AND READING。
YOUR BIBLE AND SERVING THE POOR AND GIVING WHEN THE COLLECTION PLATE COMES AROUND AND。
MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY AND YOU'RE CONFESSING YOUR SIN.。
WE WOULD LIST OFF A BUNCH OF BEHAVIORS.。
AND YET, WHAT THAT WOULD TELL ME IS THAT FOR MANY OF US, WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT JESUS, BUT。
WE DON'T KNOW THE REAL JESUS.。
YOU SEE, BECAUSE THESE THINGS, WHILE THEY'RE PART OF THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE, THEY ARE。
NOT AT THE HEART OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A CHRISTIAN.。
BECAUSE AT THE HEART OF BEING A CHRISTIAN IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME LIKE CHRIST.。
LIKE TO HAVE AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD HIMSELF AND TO LIVE A LIFE THAT IS ACTUALLY。
CONNECTED TO SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOU YOURSELF AND TO JOURNEY TO THE END OF YOUR TIME AND。
TO FEEL LIKE MAN, I LIVED FOR A LASTING IMPACT AND TO FIND WITH OTHER PEOPLE A SORT OF FRIENDSHIP。
THAT BECOMES FAMILY BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A DEEP CONNECTION TO THEM THAT THE WORLD KNOWS。
NOTHING ELSE OF IT.。
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DISCIPLE.。
IT'S TO BECOME LIKE JESUS.。
AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS, WHEN JESUS IS INVITING US TO BE HIS DISCIPLE, HE'S INVITING US INTO。
SOMETHING WE ALREADY WANT.。
LIKE WE ALL WANT THIS.。
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF FOLLOWING CHRIST.。
LIKE HE WANTS TO DO IN YOUR LIFE WHAT YOU AND I WANT DONE IN OUR LIFE.。
LIKE WE WANT TO GROW INTO SOMETHING GREATER.。
LIKE WE WANT TO BE SHAPED INTO SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT.。
WE WANT TO BE MOLDED INTO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL.。
AND YET WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT JESUS IS HE'S GOING TO DO THAT IF AND WHEN YOU FOLLOW HIM.。
BUT HE DOESN'T JUST DO IT FOR YOUR GAIN.。
HE DOES IT TO THE GLORY OF GOD AND HE DOES IT FOR THE GOOD OF ALL PEOPLE.。
LIKE THAT'S AN IDENTITY, THAT'S AN ACTIVITY THAT I CAN GET BEHIND, THAT I WANT TO BE CONNECTED。
TO AND THAT'S THE SORT OF LIFE THAT JESUS IS PROMISING US IF WE WOULD CHOOSE TO WALK WITH。
HIM.。
IF WE WOULD ASSOCIATE WITH HIM AS HIS DISCIPLES.。
AND SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING OVER THE COURSE OF THIS SERIES ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A。
DISCIPLE.。
THAT WEEK ONE, TO BE A DISCIPLE MEANS YOU ANSWER HIS CALL.。
THAT YOU DROP YOUR NETS.。
YOU LEAVE EVERYTHING.。
YOU FOLLOW AFTER HIM.。
NOT JUST BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO COST YOU SO MUCH, BUT BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO OFFER YOU。
SO MUCH.。
IN WEEK TWO, TO BE HIS DISCIPLE, WE LEARNED THAT WE NEED TO HEAR HIS HEART.。
THAT WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE HEAVY, THAT THE WEARY AND THE HEAVY LADEN, THEY CAN COME TO。
JESUS BECAUSE HE IS GENTLE AND LOWLY AT HEART.。
IN WEEK THREE, TO BE HIS DISCIPLE, WE LEARNED WHAT IT MEANT TO OBEY HIS WORDS.。
THAT ALL THE LAW AND ALL THE PROPHETS CAN BE SUMMED UP IN THE TWO GREATEST COMMANDMENTS.。
TO LOVE GOD AND TO LOVE HIS PEOPLE.。
AND TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT TO BE HIS DISCIPLES, WE SHOULD SEEK HIS PEOPLE.。
WE SHOULD NOT LIKE THE GREAT ADVENTURER CHRIS, BUT THE GREAT SAVIOR JESUS, PURSUE THE LONELIEST。
IN LIFE.。
WE SHOULD MOVE TOWARDS THOSE INACCESSIBLE TO THE WORLD AND ISOLATED MOST OF ALL.。
WE SHOULD PURSUE PEOPLE LIKE WHAT WE FIND IN LUKE CHAPTER 8.。
SO IF YOU HAVE A BIBLE, WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT VERSE 26 TOGETHER.。
THIS IS WHAT IT SAID.。
LUKE 8, 26.。
THEN THEY, TALKING ABOUT JESUS AND HIS DISCIPLES, OKAY?。
THEY SAILED TO THE COUNTRY OF THE GARISENES, WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF GALILEE.。
WHEN JESUS HAD STEPPED OUT ON LAND, THERE MET HIM A MAN FROM THE CITY WHO HAD DEMONS.。
FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WORN NO CLOTHES, AND HE HAD NOT LIVED IN A HOUSE, BUT AMONG THE。
TOMBS.。
WHEN HE SAW JESUS, HE CRIED OUT, AND HE FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM, AND HE SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE,。
"WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH ME, JESUS, SON OF THE MOST HIGH GOD?。
I BEG YOU, DO NOT TORMENT ME."。
FOR HE HAD COMMANDED THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT TO COME OUT OF THE MAN.。
FOR MANY A TIME IT HAD SEIZED HIM.。
HE WAS KEPT UNDER GUARD AND BOUND WITH CHAINS AND SHACKLES, BUT HE WOULD BREAK THE BONDS。
AND BE DRIVEN BY THE DEMON INTO THE DESERT."。
So just to set the scene, Jesus and his disciples, they have just journeyed across the Sea of。
Galilee to a land known as the Decapolis.。
And what we didn't read is that they encountered a little bit of trouble along the way.。
There's a storm that arose, and yet with but a word, Jesus silences the storm.。
What we see from Jesus is that he has authority in that story over the natural world.。
And yet as we come to this moment, as they step into the land of the Gerasenes, we find。
that he not only has authority over the natural world, but he has authority over the supernatural。
world.。
You see, they come to a land known as the Decapolis.。
The Decapolis, without going into too much detail, is Gentile country.。
It wouldn't have been native to Jesus and his disciples.。
It was a pagan land, which meant there were no Jewish festivals, no Torah study, there。
was no observance of the law.。
In fact, it was odd that Jesus and his disciples would even go to this place to begin with.。
Like it wasn't widely seen as appropriate for Jews to go to the Decapolis.。
It was frowned upon even.。
And yet Jesus, being Jesus, takes his disciples and they come aboard shore and they step out。
onto the bank.。
And as his disciples look at him wondering, "What are we doing here?"。
Jesus makes clear that he will go to the darkest of places for the darkest of people.。
That's what we learned.。
Jesus goes to the darkest places for the darkest people.。
If we as his disciples, as people that are going to walk with him, if we're going to。
see the kind of people that he sees and seek the sort of people that he seeks, we need。
to know he's going to go to some dark places to find some dark people.。
And the way Luke writes it, he tees the story up like a contest between two really great。
challengers.。
It says, "When Jesus had stepped out onto the land, there met him a man from the city。
who had demons."。
Like it sounds like the main card from a pay-per-view title fight.。
Like in this corner, out of Nazareth, wearing the white trunks, Jesus, the son of God.。
And in this corner, out of the Decapolis, wearing no trunks at all, the crazy man, right?。
That's the way it sets this thing up.。
And yet what you find as you keep reading is before the first punch is even thrown,。
the demon-possessed man just hits the mat.。
He's laid out, and there's good reason for it, but before we can actually unpack why。
that is the case, before we can look at the state of this demon, we have to look at the。
state of the man.。
So what do we learn about the condition of this man?。
Just how dark is his situation?。
Well, we get some descriptors for him.。
It says he has no clothes, that he didn't live among society, he had no home.。
If you go and you read the same account in the Gospel of Mark, you find that night and。
day he would cry out and he would cut himself with stones.。
And in both accounts, you see that he was living amongst the dead.。
He dwelt within the tombs.。
Why does any of that matter?。
Because it shows us that the evil this man had indulged, it had dehumanized him.。
Like it made him less human.。
And that's what's important for us to know.。
Just cards on the table here at the very beginning of the night.。
It is imperative that we deal with our evil.。
We reckon with our sin.。
We take action on the sort of things that God gives conviction to, lest we be dehumanized。
like this man.。
How is he dehumanized?。
He's dehumanized in three ways.。
He has no dignity.。
He has no dignity.。
Like he no longer wore clothes.。
That's pretty indignified.。
He has no community.。
He no longer lived amongst the general population, but instead he lived in total isolation.。
And he has no security.。
He doesn't have a home to speak of, but he sleeps amongst the dead in the tombs.。
Now to be clear, we don't know why the demons had entered this man originally.。
We don't know what actions he took.。
We don't know what sort of evil he was entertaining, what sins he had committed.。
All we see are the effects of it.。
That's what it means whenever it says that he was left unclean.。
That word unclean, it's translated as defiled or violated, which I don't know about you,。
but when you read this story and you hear about a demon possessed man, it feels pretty。
unrelatable.。
Like, man, okay, I've done some things, but I'm not quite at this spot.。
This guy seems to have a different level of trauma.。
There's some sort of condition he's facing that I'm not facing myself.。
And yet when you realize that uncleanness means defilement or it means violation or。
it's to be stained or tarnished or corrupted, it begins to creep into your reality a little。
bit because those are words that we can relate to.。
I know I can, and maybe you can as well.。
We know what it's like to feel defiled, what it feels like to feel corrupted.。
You see, for many of us, we got into something that we thought was going to give us life,。
bring us freedom at some point.。
And yet somewhere along the way, whatever that thing is, it actually got hold of us。
and it started to separate us from our family and our friends, started to isolate us from。
the rest of our community.。
It started to lead us to a place.。
We never thought we would actually be.。
It's defiled us.。
Maybe for some of you, it's something that you can't believe you've done.。
Like there's a shadow of shame that hangs over you because of some action you took or。
some place you went or something you said that it's just left you feeling like, man,。
this is unforgivable.。
This is unspeakable.。
I will never tell anybody of what I've done.。
This thing that I did, that place that I went, that action that I incurred, that is something。
I'm going to take to the grave.。
I refuse to tell anybody about that.。
And yet you're defiled because you're carrying so much shame for something that you never。
should have to carry.。
Maybe it's not that.。
Maybe it's an addiction you have, some unhealthy habit that you adopted at some point and it。
was small and it was manageable and it actually felt nice to begin with.。
But at some point it's grown to a place where you really can't corral it.。
You truly can't control it.。
And what it's now done is it's grown to a spot where it's jeopardizing your family and。
your friends and your finances and your future.。
Maybe it's not an addiction.。
Maybe it's the, the shame you feel for an abortion.。
Like you found yourself in a situation that you never thought you'd be in.。
Like you never intended to put yourself in a spot that felt so overwhelming and yet when。
those feelings began to grow so great and the anxiety began to cripple so strongly,。
you were forced to make a decision the likes of which you've only felt regret for since。
that time.。
Maybe it's not that.。
Maybe it's some deep seated anger you have towards somebody.。
Maybe it's habitual impurity you have with your boyfriend or your girlfriend.。
Maybe instead it's shame from lying at your job, cutting corners, despair from, from,。
from cutting or self harming yourself.。
Maybe it's not something that you've done.。
Maybe it's something that's been done to you.。
Like maybe the defilement you feel in your story, the uncleanness you have in your life。
is the product of what someone has done to you.。
Maybe it's, it's the fact that someone physically hurt you.。
Someone sexually exploited you.。
Someone emotionally manipulated you.。
They did something to you that they should never have done and yet you've been left to。
pick up the pieces and make amends on your own.。
I don't know what it is for you and yet what I do know is that whatever darkness hangs。
over you, whatever leaves you feeling unclean, whatever sin you hide and whatever hate you。
harbor you try to keep out of the public eye, whatever it is that leaves you feeling so。
dirty, Jesus looks at it.。
And he says, I want you anyways.。
You see, Jesus is not afraid of the defiled parts of us.。
We know that because Jesus journeyed across the sea for this one man.。
But by the end of the story, we find that he has to leave.。
He made the journey as an all sovereign, all knowing God to reach this one guy, totally。
undignified, totally defiled, totally despondent.。
And yet Jesus goes that distance because there's nothing about this man's condition that worries。
our Christ's compassion.。
He would go the greatest distance to be to him because Jesus is not a shepherd of spotless。
sheep.。
He's a shepherd to black sheep.。
He's a shepherd to people like you and me.。
Mark 2, 17 says, those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.。
I came not to call the righteous.。
I came to call sinners.。
You see, Jesus welcomes the unacceptable.。
He embraces the unlovable.。
He redeems the unforgivable, like that thing in your life, like the part of yourself that。
feels so dirty, the portion of your story that's too devastating, the piece of your。
existence that feels so dark.。
And Jesus looks at it, he looks past it, and he says, I will take you anyways.。
I want you as you are, not some future version of you, not some cleaned up version of you.。
I want you exactly as you are.。
Yes, will we work this out?。
For sure.。
Will I lead you to someplace better?。
Of course.。
And yet I don't need you to lead yourself there.。
I will lead you there myself.。
This is what Jesus is offering for you.。
He doesn't look at the worst parts of you and think, I've got to work around this thing.。
No, he wants everything about you.。
He wants you to come to him because he will fix the worst parts of you and he will love。
every part of you.。
This is what Jesus does.。
He goes to the darkest places for the darkest people.。
He doesn't retreat from the ugly parts of who we are.。
He advances towards them.。
That's the heart of your King.。
And yet we know as we keep reading is that we see before Jesus can help this man, he。
needs to deal with the source of the evil in this man's life.。
So he asks him in verse 30, what's your name?。
And the demon possessed man said, Legion for many demons that entered him and they begged。
him not to command them to depart into the abyss.。
Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside and they begged him to let。
them enter these.。
So he gave them permission.。
Then the demons, they came out of the man, they entered the pigs and the herd rushed。
down the steep bank into the lake and they drowned.。
Okay.。
What's going on here?。
Well, this is the only time in any gospel that we see Jesus actually engage in a dialogue。
with a demon, that he actually has a conversation that we see Jesus say one thing, the demons。
say something back and Jesus respond accordingly.。
This is the only example of a dialogue we have between Jesus and a demon.。
And now scholars, they present a variety of different reasons for why this may be.。
Some scholars suggest that Jesus is presenting the ancient near Eastern or Jewish methodology。
for exorcism.。
That burst, you must establish contact.。
The next you must have them share their name.。
And then thirdly, you must cast them out.。
Some people think that this dialogue is an evidence of the formidability of the evil。
in this man, that Jesus can't just cast it out, that instead this demon has something。
he wants to say to Jesus and he has the strength to back it up.。
And yet here's what I would say to those things.。
I think it's so much simpler than that.。
Like I think what we see as Jesus asks this demon's name is just how powerful Jesus actually。
is.。
So let me set it up like this.。
How does college game day decide where they're going to broadcast every single weekend?。
They pick the best matchup for the weekend.。
Like they pick the two top teams.。
They don't pick two no names.。
They pick two name worthy opponents and they decide that's where we're going to go and。
we're going to highlight this specific matchup.。
Now what happens when one of those teams spanks the other one?。
The strength of the team that wins is magnified because they overcame not a no name opponent,。
but a name worthy opponent.。
They're proven to be powerful.。
That's what Jesus is doing.。
He's saying, hey, you actually have a name that we need to hear because it says something。
significant about who you are and yet it's going to say something really significant。
about who I am.。
So what does the name Legion actually represent?。
Well, Legion is actually a unit within the Roman army that contained anywhere from 5,000。
to 6,000 men, meaning that there's not a square inch of this demon possessed man's life that。
is not disturbed by this supernatural evil.。
But that's not all it means.。
The name Legion, because it is representative of the Roman army, also demonstrates the harshness,。
the brutality of Roman occupation.。
And so there's not a square inch of this man's existence that isn't disturbed and there's。
not a square inch of this man's experience that is not horrible.。
Like that's what the name Legion represents for this guy.。
And yet Jesus, he in the face of one that is both great in number and great in strength,。
that is powerful by all accounts, he makes him do something you would not expect.。
How do these demons respond?。
They're a great Legion when they come to Jesus.。
They run, they cry, and they fall down.。
That's it.。
Like they behave like spoiled little children that don't get their way.。
They get eerily upset because Jesus is so much more dominant, so much more powerful。
than they are.。
And the reason we need to know it is because whatever intimidates you cowers before your。
king.。
Whatever intimidates you in life, it cowers before your king.。
Doesn't matter how big, doesn't matter how bad, doesn't matter how significant it may。
feel in strength, it has no chance against Jesus Christ.。
Think about it.。
Like this guy is possessed by a group of highly militarized demons, a lethal fighting force。
by all accounts.。
And all they can manage to do whenever they face Jesus is grovel and beg.。
That's pretty pathetic.。
And yet that's how powerful Christ is.。
Like this man has been subdued under their authority for years, and yet in a moment,。
they are subdued by Jesus' authority for all time.。
In verse 27, it says that they call Jesus "Son of the Most High God," which is really。
interesting.。
Like if you read through the Gospel of Luke, and I actually think that this is true in。
the Gospel of Matthew too, what you find is that Jesus is only called the Son of God four。
times.。
Three of those times happen in the life and the ministry of Jesus.。
And what's fascinating is that in the life and ministry of Jesus, when he's called the。
Son of God, he is never called that by any single human.。
He's called the Son of God by the angel Gabriel whenever Mary is conceived with son.。
He is called the Son of God by Satan whenever he comes to tempt Jesus in the wilderness,。
and he is called the Son of God in this story right here.。
That leaves one other example when Jesus is called the Son of God.。
And you know what happens?。
It's not in the life and the ministry of Jesus, it's at the arrest, death, and crucifixion。
of Christ.。
And it's in that moment, at the point of his mockery and not his ministry, that mankind。
speaks up and calls him the Son of God.。
It's not in reverence, it's in ridicule.。
And yet what we know is that while we may have a hard time acknowledging the deity of。
Jesus, angels and demons do not.。
They have no problem acknowledging that he is king.。
James 2, 19 says, "You believe that there is one God.。
Good, even the demons believe that."。
And they shudder.。
You see, these demons, they make no mistake when they see Jesus.。
They know who he is and they respond the only appropriate way when they come into the presence。
of royalty.。
They fall down.。
Like, that's it.。
They bow low in the presence of his royalty, his divinity.。
They do what I knew a lot of college students did whenever I worked in college ministry.。
They would realize that their academic future hung in the balance between whether a teacher。
was going to give them a good grade or a bad grade.。
And so they would grovel and beg before their professors, "Please, God, would you just have。
mercy?"。
And they would hope to God that their professor would actually give them the kind of grade。
they needed.。
They would beg, they would bow.。
They did what these demons themselves do.。
But the possessors of this man's life, they shudder at the sight of Jesus.。
And so whatever possesses you, whatever's taken hold of your life, whatever appetites。
you feel within your sinful nature, those things shudder at the sight of Christ as well.。
Now I get that some of you hear that and you think to yourself, "But you don't know what。
I've done.。
Like you don't understand how long I've been entertaining this thing or how deep down the。
rabbit hole I've gone, how dark the stain actually is.。
You don't know.。
I've been at this thing for a long time.。
You don't know how far gone I feel.。
Like I understand this may be true for other people when it comes to Jesus, but it's not。
true for me."。
And yet here's the thing that I would tell you, regardless of what your addiction is,。
regardless of whatever your vice is or your lust may be, you're not the exception to this。
rule.。
Like some of you think you are the exception to this, but you're not.。
Like think about this man, Jesus, he's not negotiating the terms of this man's release。
from these demons.。
"Hey guys, listen, I know that he's done some bad things.。
I will let you go into those pigs if you let me have him back."。
He's not negotiating the terms of this man's release.。
He is negotiating the terms of their surrender.。
That's who Jesus is.。
That's how strong he is.。
Like they know we don't stand a chance.。
Like Jesus may be outnumbered, but we're the ones that are actually outmatched.。
So it doesn't matter like how long you feel like you've been trapped in sin or how perverse。
it's grown or how often you frequent it or how hopeless you feel.。
Jesus is stronger.。
He's matchless.。
He's uncontested.。
He cannot be overcome.。
He is indomitable.。
That's your Jesus.。
Yet here's my fear.。
I fear that some of you, you won't see your defilement as deep enough to do something。
about it tonight.。
Like your sin is still concealable.。
Like you can hide whatever it was you looked at because it was private browsing or incognito。
mode.。
You can delete the history.。
Nobody will know.。
Or you justify like it's just sexting.。
It's just foreplay.。
We're not going all the way.。
Or you rationalize the gossip you indulge with friends because this is what they do.。
I don't want to be a part of it, but they're my friends and so I have to engage with it。
so that way I'm not left out or I seem awkward.。
Or you defend something on the grounds of, "Everybody has a little too much to drink."。
Or everybody bends the truth every now and then and you make small concessions that will。
lead to great compromise.。
Here's what I would tell you.。
You may not seem as outwardly defiled as this man, but you are inwardly defiled all the。
same.。
And hear me on this.。
The end of defilement is always death.。
That's what the pigs are about.。
I don't know if you've been wondering, "Man, it's kind of a weird swerve in the story,。
a strange development that we've got these pigs that these demons want to go into.。
What's the whole purpose?。
Why does Jesus allow it?"。
There's a lot of different speculation as to why it may be, but here is the simple and。
short of it.。
It shows us what the ultimate ambition of evil is.。
The ultimate ambition of evil is the destruction of life.。
That's its ambition.。
That's its aim.。
It does not want you to succeed.。
It wants you to fail.。
It wants you to fall.。
That's what the enemy is trying to do.。
And that's why I am pleading with you to do something about it tonight, to come to Jesus。
with it tonight.。
I can't want it for you any more than I do right now.。
And the reason I want it so badly for you is I know what the results are.。
That's what we see as we keep reading on.。
We see in verses 34 through 35, "When the herdsmen saw what had happened, that the pigs。
had drowned, they fled and they told it in the city and in the country.。
Then the people went out to see what had happened and they came to Jesus and guess what they。
found?。
Was it a naked man?。
Was it a crazy man?。
Was it a man that still lived within the tombs that was bleeding and frosting at the mouth?。
No, they found the man from whom the demons had gone and he was sitting at the feet of。
Jesus.。
He was clothed and he was in his right mind and they were afraid.。
Now they're the ones that are afraid.。
Like just think about the before and after shots of this guy.。
Like before this man had many demons, after no demons whatsoever.。
Before he had no clothes, after praise God he got clothes somehow.。
Before he fell down before Jesus and he shouted and yet now after he is sitting at the feet。
of Jesus and he is in his right mind, he's listening.。
What could your before and after look like?。
Like before I was addicted to porn, but after I'm porn free.。
Before I was insecure, I was codependent on other people to meet my emotional needs and。
yet now I'm totally secure because I'm connected to Christ.。
Before I was afraid that no one would ever remember me and yet now after the fact I know。
that God will never forget me.。
Before I lived for the acceptance of people and yet after I know that Christ died to prove。
just how much he wanted me.。
What could your before and after look like?。
Because Jesus wants to do it and he wants to do it tonight.。
I really believe it.。
This is how he works.。
Like he doesn't just remove the chaos from your life, he introduces order to your life.。
That's the nature of peace.。
Peace is not just the absence of conflict, it is the presence of flourishing.。
Like if this man's life was a garden, Jesus the gardener, he would come in and he would。
remove all the stones and all the debris and pull all the weeds, but he wouldn't just leave。
it like that because he wants to bring peace.。
He would plant something beautiful in its place.。
He wouldn't just pull out what was wrong, he would put in what is right.。
He would plant life.。
And the beauty of it is it takes this man from being defiled to dignified.。
It's a radical transformation.。
It's so radical in fact that it leaves the people freaking out.。
Like they're the ones that are afraid now.。
They're the ones that cannot comprehend how in fact he went from where he was to where。
he in fact now is.。
Like what if God wants to do something in your life that would freak the people out。
around you?。
Like if he wanted to move you from where you are to where he in fact wants you to be, if。
he took away the evil in your world and he put in its place something so beautiful and。
right.。
We know from this story that that is his heart, that that's what he wants to do.。
It says in 37, "All the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes, they asked him,"。
talking about Jesus, "to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear.。
So he got into the boat and he returned.。
The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with them.。
But Jesus sent him away saying, 'Return to your home and declare how much God has done。
for you.'。
And he went away and he proclaimed throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for。
him."。
Like Jesus gives dignity and he gives destiny like you wouldn't believe.。
Jesus gives dignity and he gives destiny like you wouldn't believe.。
Like Jesus did not just rescue this man from unbelievable problems.。
He rescued him to an unbelievable purpose.。
He gives it like you wouldn't believe.。
It would blow your mind to see what he would do in the life of someone, to see what he。
might do in the life of you if you would just take a chance on him.。
What was this man's purpose?。
Well this guy can't see it yet.。
But what we know is that Jesus, he leaves the Decapolis because these people are afraid。
of him.。
They ask him, they beg him to leave and he concedes.。
He pulls away.。
And yet Jesus' purpose for this man is to be the very first missionary that Jesus ever。
sends out.。
And what we find is that he does it.。
He steps into an obedient posture and as Jesus comes back to the Decapolis only one other。
time in his life.。
What he finds is a very different reception waiting for him on shore.。
At the end of this story, these people want him to leave and yet when Jesus finally comes。
back around what he finds are 4,000 people that can't wait to learn from him.。
They can't wait to get near to him.。
Where do they come from?。
This one man.。
They heard the story about a savior that gives dignity to the undignified, that gives destiny。
to the damned.。
And they knew, "I need that too."。
And so they came close.。
Paul says it like this in 2 Corinthians, "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for。
you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.。
Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of Christ。
may rest upon me.'"。
This demon possessed man, he was willing to boast his weakness and the results are astounding.。
He embraced the weakness of his story because it expressed the greatness of his God.。
So last story.。
A couple years ago, Brooke and I were flying to Nashville when a flight attendant hopped。
on the intercom and made a very common announcement.。
Attention passengers, it seems that we're going to be encountering a little bit of turbulence。
here in just a few short moments.。
If you would please return to your seats, fasten your seat belts.。
Thank you very much.。
Nothing alarming in the slightest.。
Made total sense.。
I'd heard this announcement before.。
It was commonplace.。
That is until the flight attendant came back on the intercom.。
And attention passengers, it does look like we will be experiencing some turbulence and。
it will be quite a bit of turbulence.。
Yet we want to encourage our white knuckle flyers, do not fear, though it may grow bad。
outside, you can rest assured.。
You're completely safe within the comfort of this plane.。
I remember I'm not one that gets anxious on planes.。
Yet it was in hearing that message that I began to grow somewhat anxious because I knew。
that we weren't just going to be encountering some trouble.。
We're going to be encountering quite a bit of trouble.。
We weren't just going to be driving or flying into the dark.。
We were going to be flying into quite a bit of darkness and it left me anxious.。
I felt nervous.。
And as we flew forward and I looked out the window seat, for whatever reason, I decided。
to sit in the window seat this one time, I could see the sky beginning to get dark, the。
clouds beginning to roll, the rain beginning to fall, and the lightning striking in the。
distance.。
And as it did, the whole plane began to shake.。
Everything began to shudder.。
And I could feel all of that anxiety boiling up to a breaking point within me.。
It left me to a spot where I felt so much terror in light of the trouble.。
And then I remembered the words of the flight attendant.。
It may grow dark, but rest assured, the plane can handle much more than you think.。
You're completely safe.。
You're totally comfortable.。
I don't know how bumpy life has gotten for you.。
I don't know how much turbulence you feel like you've encountered.。
I don't know how dark the sky seems to have grown and what sort of feelings have risen。
up from within.。
But what I know is that with Jesus, you're completely safe.。
You're totally safe.。
Because we have a Savior that He goes to the darkest places for the darkest people.。
This is what He did for us.。
We all at one time, we were dark in the understanding of our minds.。
We were enemies of God.。
And yet Jesus, He raced into the darkness of our existence to get close to us.。
He came to liberate a dark people, to make them sons and daughters, children of light.。
We know that Jesus, He is the King whom our enemy cowers before.。
He proved it in the fact that He came into this life, living the way that none of us。
could, living perfectly on our behalf.。
And yet He died the death all of us deserved.。
He hung Himself in our place and He absorbed all the shame and all the scrutiny and all。
of the punishment that was deserving us in our sin.。
And as He endured it on our behalf, He proved through the words, "It is finished."。
That we have nothing to be intimidated by.。
But our enemy is the one who will cower before Him, before our King who is upon His cross.。
And we know that we have a Savior who gives destiny and He gives dignity like you wouldn't。
believe.。
It would blow your mind because He has given you the dignity of belonging to His family,。
of being a co-heir with Him in the destiny of living with Him forevermore.。
I don't know what evil you face.。
I don't know how insidious your sin may be.。
But what I do know is it doesn't matter how far you've fallen, the darkness that hovers。
overhead, none are too hopeless, none are too lost.。
Jesus has given everything to prove that this is true.。
The question is, like this man, will you run and will you fall before Him tonight?。
Let me pray for us.。
God, this moment now is a moment you and I have talked a lot about.。
And so God, I'm praying for your guidance and your leadership here.。
But Lord, I don't want this to just be some lesson we've learned.。
I want this to be a lesson that we live, God.。
I don't just want for us to become more intellectually acquainted with truth.。
I want us to be more intimately acquainted with you.。
So help me now, God.。
Hey, Porch, would you look up at me for a minute?。
We often see when we look at the Scriptures that Jesus responds to the faith He sees.。
We see it over and over and over and over again throughout the Bible.。
And yet what we know in this moment is that this man's reality, it was wracked by a sort。
of evil the likes of which he should never have engaged.。
And everything about him looks like it's control possessed in this moment.。
And yet what we know is that this man does something likely upon his own volition.。
These demons, they had no reason to run to Jesus because they knew they were whipped.。
They had no reason to come to Jesus because they knew that would be the end of their story.。
So how then did this man get to the feet of Jesus?。
I think in faith, even the most microcosmic of faith he had, he ran.。
Some of you here tonight, you need to run to the feet of Jesus.。
And that's all you got to do.。
We see this man, he runs and he falls and Jesus, he takes care of the rest.。
Some of you need to let his story be your story.。
And you need to let it happen tonight.。
Not because I'm wanting to fabricate something here.。
Not because we're trying to create some moment that we can look back on or tell stories of.。
I think you need to do it because Christ has brought you here for that reason.。
And so I don't know what the darkness is in your life.。
I don't know what the shadow of shame looks like in your story.。
And yet we're going to respond and we're going to sing.。
But before we do, I want to invite those of you that feel like this is your story and。
you're at a breaking point where you want things to change.。
I want to invite you to come down here so that I can pray over you.。
But before you do, there's also a second call to the room.。
Because I think there are many of us here that are like, man, no, Jesus has liberated。
me from that.。
He has delivered me from my darkness.。
I live in the light now.。
And yet what we know as his disciples, as we seek his people, that none is too far gone.。
None is too hopeless.。
And so maybe if you're here and you know of someone that you've deemed too far gone, you've。
found to be hopeless in their story, that you don't know if there is room for God to。
move.。
Maybe tonight is a night for you to stand in the gap on their behalf.。
It's to intercede in their stead.。
It's to come down here so that way we can pray for them.。
And you can be the kind of disciple that Jesus himself has shown us to be.。
That we would go any distance to reach the isolated, to engage the inaccessible, to save。
the sinner.。
And so if you're here tonight and you want to lay the darkness down and you want to leave。
it here forevermore and you want to walk out into the light of what God has for you, I。
want to invite you to come forward.。
And if you're here and you want to stand in the gap for someone else, you want to hold。
the ground for someone else, you feel like God has called you to be the friend that leads。
someone to the cross of Christ, or you believe that God's going to move in someone's story,。
but you want to stand as a faithful disciple in their place tonight, I want to ask you。
to come down too.。
This is a bold thing.。
And I've been on the fence about doing this, but this isn't just about being the weekly。
entertainment for you.。
This is about actually doing the real work.。
And so if that's you, would you be willing to come down here in this moment?。
Would you be willing to get up and come down to the front so that we can pray for you,。
pray with you, for your friend?。
Would you be willing?。
Would you take a step of faith?。
Would you show Jesus?。
I don't just know the right things.。
I will live the right things.。
I will do the right things.。
I will make a move for my Savior and for my King.。
Some of you are coming down.。
You come down.。
Please, yeah, make your way.。
None's too far gone.。
None is too hopeless for this moment.。
Some of you, you may be with a friend here tonight.。
You'll come down.。
Yeah, come on.。
Some of you may have a friend here tonight that's told you, "Hey, I feel like I'm a lost。
cause.。
I feel like a total outcast.。
I feel like I've been abandoned by God."。
Maybe you need to be the one to grab him by the hand and say, "We're going to come down。
here together.。
And we're going to pray.。
And we're going to ask God to move.。
We're going to believe that Jesus can do in your life what he has done in so many other。
people's lives."。
Y'all come down.。
You make space.。
Yeah, keep coming.。
It's not too late.。
Some of you are sitting here and you're thinking, "Man, I don't want to be exposed.。
I don't want to be outed.。
I don't want to be seen.。
I don't want to..."。
Listen, you're in good company tonight.。
Look at these friends.。
Look at these brothers and sisters.。
These people that want to take a stand.。
That want to make a move.。
That want to live into the kind of life that God has invited us to be a part of.。
This is a chance to move and to be a part of it.。
I'm going to pray.。
And what I would ask is, if you're with someone, you know, lay a hand on them.。
And if you're in the room, would you extend a hand to the front of the stage to where。
these friends now are?。
And let me pray.。
God, I know my story.。
I know how dark my days were before you.。
But I know, Jesus, it was upon meeting you, it was when you found me that everything changed.。
I know, God, that there's some people here tonight that are kneeling here before you,。
that are sitting here before you.。
And they've done so because it's a testament to the fact that, God, they don't want the。
life they've been living any longer.。
They don't want to entertain the addiction any longer.。
They don't want to sit in the shame any longer, God.。
They don't want to feel the shadow of their sin any longer, God.。
They don't want to feel the separation from you any longer, God.。
They found themselves in a place that they were never supposed to be in, God.。
And yet, now they're here and they're saying, "No, God, I don't want this anymore.。
I want you, God.。
This is a testament to my faith.。
This is a demonstration of my belief in Jesus."。
You move towards those that move towards you.。
Your word says you draw close to those that draw close to you.。
And, God, they have come close tonight that you might come close to them.。
I pray, our Defender, lift the darkness, remove the veil.。
Free us, God, from our shame and let the flood of your forgiveness wash over us in a way。
that leads us to be eternally different, totally changed.。
You can do it, God.。
You move towards the darkest of places for the darkest of people.。
Some of us are down here, God, and we've not come for ourselves.。
We have come for someone else.。
We have a friend, a sibling, a parent, a coworker, a neighbor that is lost in something that,。
God, we are praying you would deliver them out of.。
And so, God, we're asking you to see the cries of your people here, to answer, God, our intercession。
and to liberate, God, the lives of our friends, of our family who seem too far gone, who seem。
totally isolated, who seem so very inaccessible, God, none is so inaccessible that you can't。
reach them.。
Your hand is not too short.。
Your grace is never run dry.。
So, God, we believe that tonight things can't change.。
We really do.。
I know, God, I feel trepidation in my spirit as I pray that, God, man, it could change。
right now, that, man, I don't know, maybe tomorrow is going to be hard.。
And God, that could be the case.。
And yet what I know is you can do whatever you want.。
Addiction can fall.。
Shame can fall.。
Sickness can fall.。
God, anything can be undone by the one that has undone the grave on our behalf.。
And so, God, we're begging you, come, work, move in this space.。
We love you, Lord.。
We're grateful, God, that you're a good Savior and you would reach even the most unreachable。
of people, people like us.。
It's in Christ's name we pray.。
Amen.。
In Jesus' name we pray, amen.。
