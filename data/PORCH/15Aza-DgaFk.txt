I've been tried and you know I've been tested。
I won't back down, I won't surrender。
I've seen the proof, I know the truth。
This is what I was made to do。
I was born for this。
I was born for this。
Alright Porch, how we doing?。
Yeah!。
It is awesome to be with you and our friends watching online。
It's the second week of North Dallas Porch up there in the Frisco area。
How about that? Way to go!。
We're glad you guys are up there gathering。
Welcome, welcome, welcome。
About 19 other Porch locations around the world。
And we are so glad you're jumping in online。
And I am glad to be here in Dallas with you all this summer。
We are talking about Jesus Walks。
This is an amazing privilege to get to talk about this little series tonight。
Because I get to introduce you to a friend。
There's really nothing better than you can do than to share friends。
I can remember I was going through a time in my life。
Where kind of my core friend group was radically changing。
I was not yet a believer。
I was not yet somebody that was in any way walking with Jesus。
But I had made a decision that I wanted to be an athlete。
And in my day and age, at the time I didn't think athletes were some people that were doing drugs and a lot of other things。
And so, especially being a guy that was late developing。
As I was fighting for spots and opportunities to play for a long time。
In different fields of competition。
I just decided I wasn't going to go a certain direction。
And I had no problem with some of my friends starting to make some choices。
That they were going to party in different ways in the week and do some things。
But what bothered me is they all of a sudden started to say。
Hey Todd, look, if you're not going to do what we're going to do。
Then you're not going to hang where we hang。
And I was like, well what's that all about? I thought we were friends。
Friends run together and friends do things with one another because they like each other。
Not because we're just doing certain activities。
Are you telling me that you're not my friend if I don't do what you do?。
And that was exactly what they started to tell me。
And I was just, the way I was wired, I was like, well wait a minute。
I wasn't going to be swayed by that peer pressure。
Just the way that I was made to no credit of my own。
I just kind of said, well then, to heck with that。
We're not even friends。
Let's deal with that。
And so I went from being a guy that was kind of what I would say。
In the mainstream of popularity and friend groups。
To being pretty alone。
I would say completely alone。
And it was interesting, I got a call last Thursday。
From a guy that knew me about this time。
And he happened to run across some messages。
And some talks that I had given about this Jesus。
And how my life had been radically changed。
And it just so happens, he was at a place where his heart was being tenderized。
And he called me 35, 40 years, that was actually 40 years later。
So this was before I knew Christ。
This was my late teens。
And this guy wanted to talk to me。
And he said, hey man, I've got to tell you。
I've been listening to some of the stuff you've been saying。
And I've got to let you know, I'm learning。
And I have begun to understand a little bit about what you're talking about。
And I remember a time。
When you were starting to make some choices。
That I was in another group。
And man, we just destroyed you。
We talked poorly of you。
And I remember this guy, wasn't just around me when I was in high school。
He was later, he went to the same college I did。
And he talked about the fact that when he was in college。
At one point, he came around with a group of friends。
That were getting ready to go out to a bar。
And he said, Todd, you were going, at that time I had trusted Christ。
And I was actually headed to go pour into some high school kids somewhere。
And speak, and he said, man, we saw you knock on one of the bars with us。
And I want to tell you, I laid into you。
I talked about you behind your back。
And I did everything I could to destroy your reputation。
And to make others think poorly of you。
And he said, I just want to tell you, man。
I've come to know what you knew。
And it's changed my life。
Now what's interesting, about that same time。
I had some guys。
When I was in high school。
And kind of in that transition period。
That were a year or two ahead of me。
One of his names, Jeff Kogan。
And Jeff Kogan。
Was the starting quarterback。
When I was just a freshman in high school。
And was beginning to make some choices。
Because I wanted to compete on those levels。
You know, in high school and beyond。
And Jeff Kogan saw me alone。
He saw me without a friend group。
And Jeff Kogan, the starting quarterback。
As a junior in the football team。
Learned my name。
And Jeff Kogan didn't just learn my name。
He invited me to start to hang out with his friend groups。
Now at first, I was pretty shy。
Because I was just certain。
I'm like, why would these guys want to hang out with me。
And want to break my little heart。
And want to maybe abuse me in some way。
Haze me in some way, I don't even know what that word meant。
But I just didn't trust that anybody could really love me。
But what Jeff Kogan did, is he learned my name。
He sought me, he invited me in。
And he shared his friendship with me。
And he shared his friends with me。
And I went from being a guy。
That was running alone。
To all of a sudden, Paul Frazier。
Jacques, Jeff, Chip, Michelle。
Who was the captain of the cheerleading squad。
It was Dayton, Jeff。
Started to be my friend。
I'll never forget it。
Because I thought, man, there's no greater kindness。
That you can show somebody。
Than to share friends with them。
I remember as my life went on。
You know, I spent some time in college。
With a gal that ended up having a little bit of success。
In the music field。
And she later got selected。
To be the only female soloist。
On the Michael Jackson Dangerous Tour worldwide。
I mean, she sang every duet with Michael Jackson。
Okay。
You might have heard her name a little bit later。
She went on to have her own independent career。
Her name was Cheryl Crow。
And Cheryl, you know, when she came to Dallas。
With the Dangerous Tour, when Michael Jackson was like。
Justin Bieber, right。
In fact, Michael Jackson made Justin Bieber。
Look like, you know, no one。
I mean, Michael Jackson was like the bomb。
And he was on the world tour。
And he was going around。
And Cheryl was coming through with that tour。
And I remember Cheryl had a backstage pass。
And we hung out。
And I remember her inviting me to kind of go backstage。
Before the Dangerous Tour in Dallas。
That nobody could get tickets to。
And just saying, "Come on man, come on back here, Todd。
Here's the crew, here's the team"。
And I remember she was just sharing her life。
And her friends with me, and I was like, "That was alright"。
You know, it was kind of fun to see that。
I remember when a friend did that with me with Garth Brooks。
I remember when I got to do that when I invited guys。
Into locker rooms and things of that sort。
Because you've got access somewhere。
To do the fleeting, silly things。
And I want to tell you tonight。
I'm going to do the kindest thing I can do with you。
I'm going to share with you about my friend。
His name is Jesus。
And there's no greater。
I mean, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks。
Patrick Mahomes。
I don't care what little circle you're invited into。
There is no greater friend than Jesus。
And I'm going to do the kindest thing I can do with you。
And I remember when people shared their friendships with me。
And I want to share with you about my great friend, Jesus。
And I want to share with you about my great friend, Jesus。
And I want to share with you about my great friend, Jesus。
If you've got a Bible, turn to John 5。
I hope you always bring your Bible。
Because we want to show you that this is。
This word is living and active。
And this word is true。
And it's beautiful and it's amazing。
And we're just going to tell you what happened when God walked the earth。
Now here's what's amazing。
Is that Jesus wasn't just anybody, he was God。
And when Jesus walked the earth。
There was amazing。
Activity all around him。
And Jesus still lives today。
I just got through doing a podcast。
With our friends here。
We have what's called a church leaders podcast。
Which even if you're not a leader in the church。
It's great for you to listen to。
And they asked me to jump in with them。
It was actually on discouragement。
And they just said, Todd, we want to talk to you about how people handle discouragement。
In life and ministry。
And I just shared with them very honestly。
Look guys, I got to let you know。
I'm going to tell you why in almost now 30 plus years。
Of walking with Jesus。
I've never had discouragement。
Here's why。
I love watching God go to work。
I love believing that Jesus is still alive。
That he was risen from the grave。
That when he ascended to sit at the right hand of the father。
He intercedes for me。
That his spirit, the spirit of God which indwelt in him。
When he took on human form。
Is still here and dwells in me。
Because I'm a friend of God。
And when I am walking with Jesus。
The kind of crazy things that happen。
When Jesus walked the earth still happen。
The things that happen when Jesus walked the earth。
Happen right where I am。
I'm going to make a claim that you really got to listen to me on。
And that is more miracles have happened here。
At Watermark in the last six months。
Than in all of the gospels combined。
More miracles。
More radical。
World changing things。
Have happened here at Watermark。
In the last six months。
Than in all the New Testament stories combined。
Now let me just explain that to you a couple of ways。
First of all you shouldn't be surprised。
Because Jesus said that's exactly what's going to happen。
He said if you believe in me the works that I do。
You will do also。
In fact greater works than these will you do。
If you believe in me。
In the New Testament。
In the life of Christ specifically。
Depending on how you count them。
There's only 30 some odd miracles。
That happen in all the gospels combined。
We're now a group of people。
That number in the thousands around here at Watermark。
We walk with him。
We're sharing the news of who Jesus is。
And the truth about who God is。
And we're sharing our friend Jesus and the work of God with others。
And so it shouldn't surprise you。
That the blind see, the deaf hear。
The lame walk and the dead are raised。
Now look。
I've never been a part of a resurrection。
Of a person who was flat lined。
Like dead in a grave for four days。
And somebody said。
You know。
John Doe come forth。
And the ground broke。
And the coffin was kicked open。
And the guy crawled out。
I've never been a part of that。
There's no wheelchair stapled to the walls here。
Because I've never seen somebody。
Who was in a wheelchair。
Get up and be radically healed。
After a lifetime of paralysis。
But let me just tell you something。
When Jesus said this。
What he was saying there is。
What I'm going to do is I'm going to teach sinners to live holy lives。
What I'm going to show you tonight。
Is when Jesus did some of the miracles and healings he did。
And false teachers by the way。
Are going to take advantage。
Of some of the things in the bible that are easy to misinterpret。
And difficult to understand。
And they're going to exploit you if you're not careful。
Now I believe God can do whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to do it。
If God wanted to raise people from the dead today。
Physically like he did with Lazarus。
He could do it。
If God wanted to have blind men see。
Because I spit in my hand and rub it on somebody's eyes with dirt。
He could do it。
There's no question that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever。
But you need to understand why Jesus did miracles。
And what the purpose of the miracles were。
And I'm going to introduce you to my friend Jesus。
And give you a biblical understanding of Jesus。
So you're not taken advantage of by charlatans。
And so that your life can be radically changed。
The way Jesus wants to radically change your life。
And that means if you're here and you're in a wheelchair tonight。
And you go out of here in a wheelchair。
You can still have hope。
And begin to walk。
Not physically but walk。
With a new perspective and a newness of life。
If God wants to get you out of the wheelchair he can do that。
But there's something better。
Let me encourage you with this。
I've got a friend, Johnny Erickson Tata。
Who is one of the godliest people I've ever met。
Johnny, J-O-N-I。
Erickson Tata。
Google her。
I do something called Real Truth Real Quick。
And just type in there healing。
And listen to Johnny and I talk about healing。
And Johnny who's been in a wheelchair。
A quadriplegic。
Since she was 17。
Talks about what she really needs to be healed from。
Because she's had all kinds of faith healers come up to her。
And talk to her。
About if she just had enough faith they think they could heal her。
They could get her out of the wheelchair。
And what Johnny says is let me ask you a question。
Can I just tell you, I'd love to walk on this earth again。
But if you really want to pray for my healing。
Would you pray for my anger。
Would you pray for my elitism, my pride。
My belief that I'm better than you。
Would you heal that part of me。
Because even if I get out of this wheelchair。
There's parts of me that are dead that need to be resurrected in newness of life。
And Johnny talks about what's really broken in her life。
And how Christ has dealt with that。
With amazing hope。
Listen to Johnny talk about if you have enough faith。
Will God heal you。
I beg you to watch that real truth real quick。
But let me teach you about my Jesus。
And let me tell you that right here and tonight。
Maybe in your life。
You can begin to walk with a new hope。
Maybe their dead ears will begin to hear truth。
And your blind eyes will begin to see who Jesus really is。
John chapter 5。
John chapter 5。
John chapter 5。
John chapter 5。
Here we go。
Here's my Jesus。
It says in verse 2。
Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool。
So one of the things I always love to tell you about my Bible。
Is that it's not just a collection。
Of stories。
There is no Mount Olympus。
That you can go visit。
There is no。
History。
That you can really verify。
And test in a lot of other books。
Right。
That claim to be holy。
When you read and study Hinduism。
It's called Hindu Mythology。
This is called。
History。
It is God's story。
It's H-I-S capital。
His story anchored in the context of our history。
And you can test this book。
And verify it。
You can make sense out of it。
Because there are names and places。
And dates and claims。
That's not what happened。
Then we got to get rid of this book。
Do you know that until 1990 there had never been any evidence。
There was a guy named David that lived。
And a lot of people mocked the Bible。
And said that David was just some venerated made up character。
Some hero。
In Jewish history that never really existed。
But a compilation of a lot of stories that were exaggerated。
Because they couldn't find existence of who David was。
And then just。
About 20 some odd short years ago。
We find evidence that there was a ruler named David。
Do you know that in the 1960's。
There was no evidence that there was ever a prefect。
Named Pontius Pilate。
But then in 1960 we found some stone right there by the Mediterranean Sea。
That had the name Pontius Pilate on it。
Do you know there has never been a single archaeological discovery。
In the history of the world。
That has contradicted anything in this book。
Do you know there is not a single prophecy。
That this book has said won't happen。
That hasn't happened yet already。
That needed to happen for this book to be called true。
This is a book that God decided to anchor in history。
So you can test it。
And make sense out of it。
I've been to Bethesda。
I've been through the Sheep Gate。
Right here in Jerusalem。
At this place where there was。
Um。
A lot of pagan practices that were going on。
Let me just read you the story。
It says now they're in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate。
There was a pool which in Hebrew is called Bethesda。
It's interesting Beth means house。
Hasad or Hesed。
Means love。
Or grace or kindness。
It's the most one of the most often used words in your Bible。
It's the covenant love of God。
The unconditional kindness of God。
This is the house of grace。
The house of kindness。
That's what this place was called。
Now in Bethesda right here。
Um there was this。
Development and the reason there was a development there。
Is because there were springs。
And in these springs。
You're going to find out。
That um they believed that they held。
Some supernatural ability。
To heal。
Check this。
It says around this place。
That had five porticos。
In these lay a multitude of those who were sick。
And blind and lame and withered。
There was all kinds of evidences。
Of broken humanity。
There was a blend there。
It's called syncretism of Greek mythology。
Roman mythology and even just some。
Judaic belief that was right there。
So by the way。
If you go to this place today and you can go to it。
Bethesda it's still there it's been excavated。
In about a 30 second walk。
You will go through another gate。
And you'll be on what's called the temple mount。
In about 3 minutes you could have been to what's called。
The holy of holies。
These were people。
That were not seeking the God。
Of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to be healed。
These were people that were kind of。
Caught up over here。
In worship in pagan practices。
And cult worship and what had happened。
Is there was superstition in that day。
I'll read to you this little section。
Right here in verses 3 and 4。
It says there was a bunch of folks that were lame and withered。
That were waiting for the moving of the waters。
For an angel of the Lord。
And this is now what they believed。
This is not what happened。
An angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons。
Into the pool and stirred up the water。
Whoever then first after the stirring up of the water。
Stepped in was made well from whatever。
Disease with which he was afflicted。
Now let me ask you a question。
What kind of people could get to a water first when it stirred。
And by the way you're kind of like well what's that mean。
What does the water stir? The water stirred because。
They didn't know it but there was a deep spring that was there。
And every now and then when the water would come out。
And move forward because of rainy season。
Things like that there would be a flow。
And the water would stir and it would come up。
And bubble up and it would move the surface of the water。
Inside these pools and then people would。
Scurry to jump in and there were all kinds of people there。
Let me ask you a question。
If there were people there that were lame and there were other people there。
That were discouraged or there were people there。
That were depressed or there were people there that had skin diseases。
Which people would make it into the water first?。
It wouldn't be the lame people。
If the belief was first come first serve。
Man you're going to be sitting right there。
And if you're discouraged。
Probably the people, most of the people with the most psychosomatic illnesses。
Who believe that there's some healing power there。
And there's all kinds of evidence。
If you believe something can help you。
It typically can help you。
Especially if your diseases are not。
You're quadriplegic or paralytic。
You'd get in that water and you'd come out and go。
I'm healed, I'm healed, I got it, I got it。
And I guarantee you there'd be a fit of adrenaline。
I guarantee you if you were the first one in。
There was a sense of belief。
And it probably did something for you。
At least in the short term。
Blind people wouldn't get in first。
They couldn't see that the water stirred。
If you ever go to some of the charlatans today。
They're involved in healing ministries。
Watch carefully about how they move the critically ill。
And the sick and the wheelchairs away from the stage。
Watch the way that they are telling you。
That you're going to be healed。
And you're going to be healed。
And you're going to be healed。
And they are telling you。
Sometimes even when people。
Are going through certain types of healings。
That if it doesn't happen completely。
In that moment, sometimes they put people in wheelchairs。
Who have limps and they get them up。
And they say stand up and they stand up with their limp。
And they go he's walking。
Just like he was walking before they put him in the wheelchair。
Now I'm going to tell you God can do whatever he wants to do。
Whenever he wants to do it。
But a lot of what you see。
On TV and amongst these charlatans。
Is exactly that。
And it offends God。
And it offends Jesus。
The reason that Jesus did miracles by the way。
Is because he was trying to show you who he was。
The reason there's sickness。
The reason there's disease。
The reason there's death on this earth。
Is because of sin。
God didn't create us with cancer。
And with disease。
And with brokenness。
There were no down syndrome children。
Born to Adam and Eve。
If they conceived before the fall。
And there's no evidence that they did。
All of that is a result。
Of us leaving the God of perfection。
And being left to our own way。
Sin and death and disease entered into the world。
What Jesus is about to show you。
Is that he has the ability to reverse the effects of sin。
Who can do that?。
Only God can reverse the effects of sin。
Because the effects of sin are here。
Because we have offended God。
There's no other way。
But to forgive God。
There's a reason。
For example when Jesus healed somebody else。
He was sitting there and somebody came to him。
Who was lame。
And Jesus looked at this guy。
And he said hey your sins are forgiven。
And the religious leaders were very offended。
They go hey you can't forgive sins。
Nobody can forgive sins except God。
And so what did Jesus do?。
Because that is an excellent point。
Because sin is an offense against God。
And so what did Jesus say。
He said that no man has authority on earth to forgive sins。
In other words that I am the visible image of the invisible God。
That this isn't just Jesus walking。
This is God walking。
Remember how I told you I'm going to do the kindest thing I can do。
Which is to share my friend with you。
I'm going to share with you the truth about who God is。
You want to know what God looks like? Look at Jesus。
And by the way isn't it interesting。
That even people。
Who aren't Christians。
Love Jesus。
Because we're like。
If people could really be like that。
Really that loving, really that selfless。
I'd want to know him more。
And you should want to know more of Jesus。
But Jesus says。
Hey that's an excellent point。
Only God can forgive sins。
In order that you might know who I am。
I say to you take up your pallet and walk。
Because only God can give regeneration。
To paralyzed crippled legs。
This wasn't the guy with a limp。
This was the guy that stood up and walked。
The reason Jesus did the miracles he did。
Is to authenticate his words。
He said if you don't believe me。
Believe the works that I do。
Jesus a little bit later said this。
He said there's not going to be any more signs。
I didn't come here to do a bunch of signs。
He didn't come here to heal everybody。
He came here to not heal everybody。
From the effects of the fall。
In short term temporal ways。
He came to heal everybody from the effects of the fall。
And their separation from God。
He said heaven's going to be where there's no disease。
Heaven's going to be where there's no tears。
Heaven's going to be where there's no death。
On this earth there's still going to be。
Paralyzation, cancer, betrayal, and despair。
But I am going to give you hope。
And I'm going to restore you into relationship with me。
So that when judgment comes upon sin。
It passes over you。
And I move you into the kingdom I intended for you。
But I'm not going to heal everybody。
Guess what Jesus didn't heal everybody。
We're at a place where there's scores of afflicted people。
And my friend Jesus walks up。
And he says this。
There was a man there who had been ill for 38 years。
There's certain numbers, there's a reason that the Bible has in it what it has in it。
I mean there's a reason that John put down 38。
And you might go well Todd what's the reason John put down 38?。
Well here's an idea。
There are certain numbers in societies that always mean something。
Right?。
Like in America, if I say 9/11。
Does that mean something to you?。
That number, those numbers together mean something to you don't they?。
The number 1776 means something to you doesn't it? In America?。
Say yes, I remember American history。
Right?。
There are certain numbers that mean something。
You can even go kind of the superstitious way。
I mean February 14th means something for you, right?。
It means you're alone again, despairing and depressed。
[Laughter]。
That's right, it's sad day, singles awareness day, that's what Valentine's is。
[Laughter]。
But there's certain numbers that mean something。
If you were a Jew, the number 38 meant something to you。
Now listen, Jesus came to reveal who he was。
The reason 38 meant something to you, if you went back and looked in the book of Deuteronomy。
It talks about how the fact that God wanted to take Israel。
And deliver them out of Egypt and the oppression of the powers of the earth。
And set them free from being slaves to free。
Take them from a place of oppression to a place of promise。
In a land flowing with milk and honey。
Where they would live in cities and in homes that they did not build。
That they would be safe and have protection。
It was a picture of what God wants to do for all humanity。
And God didn't uniquely love the Jews。
He chose to show his love to the Jews。
That all the nations of the earth could be blessed through the Jews。
That was his idea。
So that all the nations of the earth would know that he is God。
But what happens is that they were led out of Egypt。
And as God then sent spies into the holy land。
And showed them what they were going to go take。
There were giants in the land。
And they go, man, we can't fight those people, we can't take those people。
So the 12 spies went back and 10 of them said。
There's no way, man, we got our clock clean。
Two of them said, no, we can do this because God is for us。
God just delivered us from Egypt。
Surely he can give us what he said he's going to give us there。
But the 10 carried the day。
And took the whole nation into a place where they did not trust God。
And so God said, this wicked generation。
Shall all pass away。
And then I'll take a new generation to the land that believes in me。
Guess how long it was from the moment that he pronounced that judgment。
Until they got into the land, the answer is 38 years。
They lived a life of wondering and oppression。
And hopelessness and despair。
It's the wilderness wondering years。
Here's a guy that is 38。
By the way, 38 was longer than the average life expectancy。
During the time of Christ。
In other words, everything about this guy's life。
From beginning to end was lame, right?。
Was hopeless。
And there's nobody that could help him。
He was without God and without hope in the world。
Trusting in superstitions to heal him。
Had nobody who cared for him。
You're going to find a little bit later。
He said, there's no man who could help me。
And he was exactly right, there's no man that could help him。
And I'm here to tell you tonight, there's no man that can help you。
This man didn't know God, but God knew him and knew his despair。
And you're going to see that this man。
Jesus uniquely went and grabbed him。
Because he was trying to show you something。
He knew he was trying to say, hey, I can get you out of your wonderings。
And your wilderness。
And to all of us, he's just saying, are you sick and tired of your lame life?。
Jesus asked him amazing questions。
The question I'm going to ask you tonight, because my friend wants you to hear it。
And the question is found right here in verse 6。
It says, when Jesus saw him lying there。
And he knew that he had already been a long time in that condition。
