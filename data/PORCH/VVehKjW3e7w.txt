Just offer your heart to him once again.。
Once again, as if it were the first time, Father, we surrender our hearts to you.。
We surrender everything, our lives, our desires.。
Everything we've ever wanted doesn't even come close to the fulfillment we find in you, in fellowship with you.。
Communion with you satisfies everything.。
It's the fulfillment of who we are.。
It's just to know you, to love you, Lord.。
Tonight, we just once again give you our attention.。
Once again, we give you our worship, our focus, our hearts, everything to Jesus.。
