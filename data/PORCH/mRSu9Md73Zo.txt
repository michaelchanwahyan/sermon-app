[Music]。
Well, how we doing, Ports? Come on.。
Hey, would you help me welcome all of our PortsLive locations around the nation.。
Fort Worth, Midland, Des Moines, Indianapolis, Greater Lafayette, Dayton, Scottsdale, Boise, Fresno.。
And for the very first time, I'm coming at you, the PortsLive Wheaton, Illinois. Let's go.。
Hey, if you have a copy of God's Word, I hope you do, you can find the book of Hebrews.。
I'm a coffee drinker, so Hebrews is my favorite book of the Bible.。
Come on, somebody. That's poor.。
Hey, man, that's a bad dad joke right there. But thank you for entertaining me with that laugh.。
Hebrews, chapter 12 is where we'll be tonight.。
Hey, before we get going, anybody watch the Olympics?。
Yeah, dude, I love the Olympics. Like I'm all in, Team USA.。
Like I keep the ESPN up on my browser, like as I'm checking it nonstop.。
Like I'm like, hey, are we on top still? Is Team USA on top?。
And you know, we're going back and forth with China with the gold and we end up tying them, boo.。
But whatever, they're pretty good.。
But one thing I love about the Olympics is the men's 4x100 relay.。
Anybody? Okay. Yeah, yeah.。
So I love the men's 4x100 relay. It's one of my favorite events.。
And man, the reason why I love it, it's like technical and, you know, people are getting DQ'd all the time.。
And, you know, it's just a lot, lots going on in the men's 4x100 relay.。
And I don't know if you saw this a few years back, but the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, the men's 4x100 relay,。
they were heavily favored to win the gold.。
Like it was like the dream team.。
They had three out of the 10 fastest men in all the world on one team.。
And people thought they were just going to take gold and no problem.。
And that year they did not even get gold and they failed to qualify.。
Because in a relay race, it's not really how fast the runner is.。
In a relay race, it comes down to what they call the exchange zone.。
The exchange zone is 1.9 meters or 1.9 seconds, 20 meters.。
And it's what happens in the exchange zone that will make or break the race.。
And so in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, this is what happened right here.。
Like Odoo reaches back and chokeslams his partner.。
Like that's it.。
And they not only didn't get gold that year, they failed to even qualify.。
So I'm like 2024 is our year.。
Like this is it.。
Like no holding back.。
We're going all in.。
Paris.。
That's when we're going to take the gold.。
And the same thing or like it happened.。
Check out this picture.。
The dude grabs Kun-Fu Kenny's arm and tries to slow him down.。
And so they didn't even get gold.。
I mean, they failed to even qualify.。
Because everything that will make or break that race happens in the exchange zone.。
And so I'm like, okay, where are you going with this Josiah?。
This is where I'm going.。
I share that with you tonight because in a relay race, it doesn't matter if you have the fastest runners.。
What matters is did you pass the baton.。
Hebrews chapter 12, as we open up God's word, is going to tell us that our job as Christians is to pass the baton.。
Like you're like, well, what's the baton?。
The baton is our faith in Jesus Christ.。
And what Hebrews is going to say tonight is that if you're a believer, if you're a follower of Jesus,。
then our job is to pass the baton of our faith from one person to the next.。
Hebrews chapter 12.。
[Reading from book]。
Side note.。
Do you know what the joy that was set before him was?。
You.。
That the saints are "glorious riches of the inheritance of Christ."。
And so when he was standing in front of Galgotha looking at the bloody, horrible death that he was going to endure for you and I,。
he said, hey, what would make it worth it to endure that death?。
To endure that pain?。
Part of the answer was you.。
By paying the price of our sins through his death on the cross so that we would be free from the penalty of sin and get eternity with him.。
We were the joy that was set before him.。
Now Hebrews 12 starts with the word "therefore."。
And if you've been around Bible teaching for any time, you know that any time you see the word "therefore," you have to work backwards and you have to ask what the "therefore" was there for.。
So in Hebrews 11, it's one of the most famous chapters in all the Bible.。
Because in Hebrews 11, it's what we call the Hall of Faith, where you get 16 consecutive stories about men and women going all the way back to Genesis,。
stretching forward to Hebrews about men and women who took the baton of their faith and passed it to the people around them and to the next generation.。
Which should serve as a reminder of you and I, if you're a believer in the room tonight, that we should do the same.。
Now think about this, Porch.。
God looked at everyone who would ever exist everywhere and plucked them out of eternity.。
He then positioned you in time, has proportioned your gifts, and he's given you resources, and he's planted you right here at the porch.。
And God's given us the responsibility to pass the baton of our faith to our generation.。
You ask, "What's my purpose in life?"。
Listen to me.。
This is our purpose.。
Paul, the apostle Paul who wrote two-thirds in the New Testament, he understood his purpose, which has become my life verse.。
Acts 20, 24 just says this, "But my life is worth nothing to me unless I use it for finishing the work assigned to me by my Lord Jesus."。
What's that work, Paul?。
The work of telling others the good news about his wonderful grace.。
Passing the baton of our faith to the people around us.。
I've been at the porch for five years now, and each week, without fail, I have a front-row seat to watch young adults fall down the aisles of this place because they saw Jesus, and they now want to surrender their life to him.。
And can I tell you something?。
It never gets old.。
It's amazing.。
I mean, I don't want to give my life to anything else but that.。
And so tonight, I want to give us five lessons that I've learned over the five years here at the porch that has helped us pass the baton of our faith to those around us.。
Certainly not an exhaustive list, but it's helpful, I think.。
Lessons that I've learned from much wiser people that I'm stealing from them and giving to you tonight.。
Passing the baton of our faith.。
Lesson 1 starts with this.。
Learning how to pray and abide.。
Pray and abide.。
Mark 1.35.。
This is Jesus rising very early in the morning while it was still dark, departed and went out to a desolate place and there he prayed.。
There's four verbs in this one verse.。
Do you see it?。
Rising very early.。
And the day even starts, he's getting up and spending time with the father.。
Departed, number 2.。
So he went somewhere.。
Went is number 3.。
Like he actually did it.。
He didn't just depart and get in his car and sit there and scroll on Instagram.。
No, he literally went somewhere and it says he went to a desolate place.。
This word desolate means without people.。
Without distractions.。
And there he prayed.。
Why would Jesus do this?。
Because he believed prayer works.。
You think one of the first things I believe we're going to see when we get to heaven is this.。
That prayer really worked.。
Like prayer really worked.。
Like everything is going to come clear and you're going to stand before Jesus and you're going to be like, man, that thing I was doing from time to time, man, it really worked.。
And my heart with his heart and my thoughts with his thoughts and my actions with his actions.。
He was beginning to align those things to him.。
Like we're going to get up there and we're going to say, wow, man, you were really listening to me.。
Talking to you was really doing something.。
Jesus says this in John 15, 5, that apart from me you can do nothing.。
He's inviting us into a life of dependence on him.。
Let me read it.。
I'm the vine, you're the branches.。
Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit.。
For apart from me you can do nothing.。
Like Jesus is telling us that he's the vine.。
He's the source of life.。
If you're praying or lack thereof, if you're not praying, that you're quietly confident that money, time, and your stuff is all you need in life.。
Like that's what we're communicating to God.。
If we're not praying, then we're quietly confident that God, that's all we really need.。
If you want to know how dependent you are, there's a simple test I can give you.。
Ask this question.。
How much have you prayed today?。
Like this simple question will reflect on whether you were dependent with a lot of time that God is giving you today.。
And some of you sitting there right now and you're just saying, well, I didn't really pray a whole lot today.。
Some of you are thinking, wow, since the moment I woke up until I came into this place, I haven't prayed.。
I would just tell you that you're probably not dependent on God.。
God is telling us that we don't have the resources to do life the way he intended us to.。
Simply the most dangerous thing that you and I can do today is pray and abide.。
Why?。
Because prayer affects what you expect.。
Prayer affects what you expect.。
For example, if you expect to get married someday, then praying will begin to affect that area of your life.。
Praying for a spouse every day just makes sense.。
Not just praying that you would meet him or her, but praying that when you meet him or her,。
that there would just be this connection where God is affirming that this person is the person that you should marry.。
I have a good friend.。
She's also on staff.。
You saw her up here earlier, Grace Ball.。
Love this girl.。
She's amazing.。
She did ministry with me in Kansas City.。
She's now here in Dallas on staff here at the porch.。
She sent me her prayer list.。
I asked for it.。
I said, hey, can I share your prayer list?。
She expected to get married someday.。
I'm like, I want to see what's on that list.。
So here it is.。
Here's what's on that list.。
Check it out.。
Don't worry, I got approval.。
Look at this.。
I want a guy who's close to his family.。
Family, country, music.。
That sounds like a preference.。
Heart for high school, young adults, wants to go overseas, loves dogs, preference, competitive, funny,。
connection to Nashville, not sure what's going on there.。
Dimpled?。
Okay.。
Would impact my family's faith and joy to our lives, could handle my mom's battle.。
Like really serious stuff.。
Our missions, gifts would align, peace from the beginning, excited, and joy from family.。
I mean, that's a pretty good list, right?。
You can clap it up and give it up for that.。
And so why do I share that with you tonight?。
Well, it's going to be on my Insta stories after the message if any of you bachelors fit the categories, right?。
No, that's not why.。
The reason why I share that with you tonight is because Jesus said you could pray for whatever you want.。
You know that?。
John 14.。
Verse 13, here's what he says.。
And I will do whatever you ask in my name so that the father may be glorified in the son.。
You may ask me for anything in my name and I will do it.。
Six different times Jesus says ask and it will be given to you.。
But many of us don't believe this because we tried and we didn't get what our -- we didn't really get what we wanted.。
And so I would say, hey, the problem isn't your prayer.。
The problem is maybe the lack of praying, the continual praying and abiding that you have done with the Lord.。
Because here's what I know.。
You can ask God for whatever you want because he already knows.。
Like some of you are trying to Jesus juke God and say I don't need a spouse.。
But deep down you want a spouse and you want him to see you as satisfied.。
You are like you are not juking God.。
You are not going to win there.。
So just pray for a spouse.。
But you can ask God for whatever you want.。
Here's the kicker.。
Ask him for what he wants.。
Like you can -- hey, God, I want this but more than anything that I want, I want what you want, God.。
I want to do your will for my life, God.。
And as you begin to pray that prayer, guess what God begins to do?。
He begins to align our heart with his, our request with his request.。
Say something, God, would you show me what you want?。
And would you give me a greater desire in my heart for what you want than what I want?。
And if I don't want what you want, God, help me not to want it.。
Man, this was all too real.。
I found myself in my mid-20s.。
Still single.。
I don't think I had gone on a date in like three years.。
Holler, anybody in the room?。
Okay.。
And I was just getting depressed, man.。
And so I was single and lonely.。
And I remember crying out to God, just talking to him.。
Hey, God, you know your brother has got needs, like sexual needs.。
Yeah, it just got real.。
And so, you know, during that time, man, I was just struggling every once in a while with porn and masturbation.。
There I said it.。
And I remember God, as I was going to him with complete honesty and transparency,。
I remember him showing me that my greatest need wasn't to get a girlfriend to fix my loneliness,。
wasn't to get a wife to satisfy my sexual desires.。
The greatest need that God began to show me in that season was more of him.。
So that he could be my satisfaction.。
You see, I think sometimes we shortchange prayer, and we sometimes use it to get more from God instead of getting more of God.。
That's the whole point of prayer, is that we would go to him and not necessarily just ask him for what we want.。
You know, you saw grace.。
Like, where's grace?。
Where's grace?。
Yeah, there you are.。
You saw grace asking God for what she wanted, you know what I'm saying?。
If he didn't give you a man that was dimpled, you'd be okay, right?。
Okay.。
If he didn't give you a man at all, would you be okay?。
Okay, yeah, but she just threw up her ring because she just got engaged.。
Sorry, fellas.。
Ah!。
But I know this woman.。
She has been content and satisfied with God.。
But there's a tension that we can manage with God.。
Like, God wants you to bring your request to him.。
But ultimately, he wants to give you more of himself.。
And as he does, he begins to show you that he's enough.。
That he's enough.。
The Lord is my shepherd.。
I shall not -- come on -- want.。
I have everything I need.。
I have everything I need in him.。
So hard to walk out, easier to say.。
But I know that passing the baton of our faith happens when we。
see our need to pray and abide.。
Lesson 2, obstacles are opportunities for my good and。
his glory.。
Obstacles are opportunities for my good and his glory.。
What I love about the book of Ecclesiastes is it sums it up。
perfectly in Ecclesiastes 3.。
Here's what it says in verse 1.。
There is a time for everything, a season for every activity under。
the heavens, a time to be born and a time to die.。
So a person's birthday and his funeral.。
A time to plant and a time to uproot.。
I'm not a person but with plants.。
105 degrees here in Texas, I uprooted all of my roses.。
They are getting crushed.。
I did that this past weekend, it was awesome.。
A time to kill and a time to heal and a time to tear down and。
a time to build and a time to weep and a time to laugh and a。
time to mourn and a time to dance.。
Isn't this the entire human experience summed up in a few。
verses?。
There is a time for everything Solomon is saying.。
He's in control of the good times and the bad.。
Everyone will laugh and cry and mourn and dance and everyone。
will be born and everyone will die.。
No one gets to avoid the obstacles and the pain of life.。
Why?。
Because this isn't the world we had.。
Genesis 1 and 2, man, paradise, perfection.。
But this is the world that we have.。
Genesis 3, sin, suffering and death.。
But listen to me, this isn't the world that we will have.。
Like I read the rest of the book.。
If you go to Revelation 21, he says it.。
Paradise lost in the garden, perfection will be paradise。
regained someday.。
Amen.。
And so that's what we can hold our hat on.。
Because he is a good father who has provided a way in the midst。
of our pain.。
In the midst of our obstacles.。
And those obstacles are opportunities to trust God more。
and to give him glory.。
Jesus says it like this in John 16.33...。
I have said these things that in me you may have peace.。
Anybody want peace tonight?。
I do.。
In the world you will have tribulation but take heart,。
I've overcome the world.。
What do you do with the big question marks in life when the。
Bible is filled with a bunch of exclamation points?。
Like your job isn't hitting the way it should.。
Like you didn't get the promotion, you didn't get the。
raise.。
Maybe a loved one has passed away.。
You found out that someone has stage 4 cancer.。
A friend stabs you in the back.。
You thought you would be out of debt by now.。
And what we do is we start to question God's ability to make。
the obstacles in our life opportunities for our good and。
his glory.。
This is why if you lead someone to Christ, don't tell them。
everything will turn out well in their life.。
Like right here and now.。
It will ultimately.。
But it might get harder.。
Because a Christian isn't exempt from the pains of this world.。
When sin entered the world it sent creation into chaos.。
So what's our solution?。
Is it deism?。
Like God is just absent.。
He's the creator of everything.。
But he went on furlough.。
He's just taking a break.。
Is it dualism?。
Is that the solution?。
That God and Satan are kind of equal and there's this tennis。
match going on with God and Satan and sometimes Satan wins and。
sometimes God wins.。
No.。
Genesis 3.15, read it.。
It's the first gospel.。
It's called proto-evangelion for all my nerds in the room。
tonight.。
It's the first, proto-first, evangelion gospel.。
It tells us that there's coming a Messiah who will crush the。
head of the serpent.。
And we saw that.。
What in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John where Jesus。
went ultimately to the cross to crush the head of the serpent,。
Satan.。
And to once and for all end the curse for all men.。
For those of us that puts our faith and trust in him.。
Have you ever read the book of Job?。
Man, Job lost his possessions, his children and his health.。
Do we have to understand all things?。
No, but we have to understand that God is in control of all。
things.。
I've said this before here at the porch, but if I go home。
tonight and I found out that my house was burned down and my。
wife and my three kids were killed in the fire.。
Don't try to comfort me and tell me that accidents happen.。
I can't deal with that.。
I can't deal with that.。
I got to know that there's a God that's in control.。
Like if I find out tomorrow that I have stage 4 cancer and just。
two weeks to live.。
Like I can't deal with the fact that God isn't God.。
And hasn't provided a way for me to be reconciled to him.。
You know where I'm going to end up?。
Going back to the bottle.。
Going back to an illegitimate relationship.。
Going to a pill.。
Going to what the world has offered us.。
That's where I will go.。
And I will find that that's an empty well because I've already。
gone there in my past.。
I have to know that God is in control.。
Like you're not going to comfort me by saying God is not God.。
Let me ask you this question.。
How many of you in the last five years have gone through deep。
seated pain that you really can't make sense of?。
Just show of hands.。
Put your hands up in the air.。
Yeah, high.。
That's a majority of us in the room.。
So what's our solution?。
We remember the gospel.。
Like we remember the gospel.。
The greatest act of injustice that's ever happened,。
the perfect person Jesus, whoever lived was the divine man.。
Rejected, betrayed, denied, tortured, put on a cross and killed.。
He of all people didn't deserve any of it.。
Jesus was the one person who did everything God required of him and。
he didn't fail at any point.。
And what did he get for his obedience and righteousness?。
He got tortured, nailed to the cross and suffocated to death.。
What good could possibly come out of an evil like that?。
Yet God turned the most evil thing that has ever happened into the。
best thing that has ever happened.。
Today we can celebrate Jesus' suffering and death because he。
triumphed over sin.。
Today we can celebrate that the grave is empty.。
And if the grave is empty, then anything is possible.。
Amen.。
Jesus rose from the dead, defeated evil and sin,。
and the ball's in your court.。
[Applause]。
This is the hope that we have.。
And so we can be reconciled with our creator and know that God is God.。
And he can take our obstacles and use them for our good and his glory.。
Are you trying to tell me, Josiah,。
that he can cause all things to work together for the good of those who。
love him and are called according to his purpose?。
Yeah.。
Where do I get that?。
Where do you get that?。
Romans 8.28.。
Look what it says.。
Fix your eyes on the screen.。
Let this wash over you tonight.。
And we know that those who love God,。
all things work together for good for those who are called according to。
his purpose.。
Passing the baton of our faith happens when we see obstacles as。
opportunities for my good and his good.。
Lesson three.。
Reach your generation for the gospel.。
The gospel is the power of God.。
So share it often.。
Romans 1.16, Paul says it like this.。
For I'm not ashamed of the gospel,。
for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.。
Everyone.。
For the Jew first and also the Greek.。
I believe God is going to do something amazing today.。
And he wants to use you to do it.。
I believe God is going to do something incredible in this place.。
He's going to do something incredible around me.。
And all I got to do is avail myself to the glory of God.。
I got to avail myself to God and say, God,。
I want your heart to be a light in my heart so that you can use me in。
spite of me for your kingdom purpose.。
That our hearts should be fully devoted to him.。
What if that was our prayer?。
Why?。
Because he wants to use you to reach your generation.。
Second Chronicles 16.9 says it like this.。
For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to。
those whose hearts are not blinded by the eye of the Lord.。
And I want you to give strong support to those whose heart is。
blameless toward him.。
To those whose perfection is blameless towards him?。
No.。
To those whose heart is blameless towards him.。
Avail yourself to the work of God and watch God move in your life in。
ways that you never thought were possible.。
First off, know that God can use me when you understand that you have need.。
You know, the only thing you need to come to God is need.。
Like some of us right here today, like I'm going to get to God by doing good works.。
If my good works outweigh my bad works, I'm going to get to God.。
Well, if that was the case, then why did Jesus die on the cross?。
Not one of us in this room is going to stand before God and pull out our。
resume of good things that we've done and think that's suffice to get to him.。
It's only because of what he did on the cross that you can be set free and。
forgiven from your sin.。
I keep bumping my head against the same wall, making the same mistakes,。
doing the same sins like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool that。
returns to his folly.。
I keep going back to that which is disgusting, impure, and a mockery of God.。
And I need someone to save me, to reach in the miry pit and pull me out.。
How do you know if you've done that?。
When you begin to talk about what he delivered you from.。
You're like, no, man, I'm never going to talk about that abortion.。
No, I'm never going to talk about cutting and overeating or under eating。
because life feels out of control and that's the only thing I can control.。
I'm never going to talk about envy and jealousy.。
I'm never going to talk about my porn addiction, my secret sin.。
No, when you begin to talk about it, guess what happens?。
Is the same baggage you used to carry, you begin to talk about it to other。
people who carry that baggage and he begins to use your story for his glory。
to help people who carry the same baggage you used to carry.。
That's how you know.。
That's how you know that God can use you.。
Have you come in this room with need tonight?。
Have you bended the knee?。
Have you surrendered your life to him and are you beginning to talk about。
the things that he has freed you from?。
All of a sudden with the enemy used for evil, God begins to use it for good.。
What else are you going to give your life to?。
What else?。
Some of you are like, man, maybe.。
Maybe?。
Like some of us, man, and I get it, I was there.。
We lack.。
We look at this book and read it and we're like, man, God, can you truly。
use the gospel to change people's lives?。
And it's Dallas and there is a lot of young adults here and it's kind of。
the place to gather on a Tuesday night.。
Are people truly living the way this guy is proclaiming with a vein。
coming out of the side of his head.。
Yes, they are living like this, man.。
And God is calling you to do the same.。
You are like, give me a story, Josiah.。
Because I doubt the gospel can still change people.。
All right, here you go.。
I met a young adult.。
And he began to struggle with his -- he was struggling with his。
sexuality, gender dysphoria, the whole nine yards.。
And he got kicked out of his house when he opened up about it.。
I said, come on, man, come in.。
Mi casa, su casa.。
Like let's go, let's do life together.。
And so he moves in.。
Make him a bed.。
Give him a room.。
And we begin to process what's happened.。
I just listened to him, like what's your story, bro.。
He begins to share his story.。
You know what I didn't do?。
What?。
How dare you?。
How could you feel like that?。
I just said, hey, man, I get how you got there.。
I get why you feel that way.。
I get why you think that.。
But there's another way.。
And I began to share the gospel with him.。
And he began to renew his mind by getting into God's word.。
And he rejected the lies of the world.。
And you know what Jesus did?。
He saved him.。
He saved him by hearing the gospel.。
When did we stop believing that the gospel wasn't enough to save somebody?。
Like the gospel is the good news of Jesus Christ and it can do anything as it。
moves into your neighborhood.。
And he begins to call you to something different.。
It begins to renew the mind.。
And you begin to reject the lies that you began to believe in way back when.。
And listen, man, maybe this is your story.。
If your mind and body feel out of alignment with any type of sin,。
I'm not just talking about homosexuality, gender dysphoria.。
Listen, can we just be honest tonight?。
There's more heterosexual sin going on in this room than homosexual sin.。
I was one of them.。
Sleeping with anyone that's not your spouse.。
Pulling up the two-dimensional images before you go to bed.。
Anything that is inconsistent with the character of Christ will。
ultimately kill you.。
And the world and the world are going to give you two different responses.。
Here's what the world says.。
Listen to your mind and do whatever your body wants.。
But check this out.。
The word says something different.。
Romans 12 says this...。
So worship is more than just singing songs.。
It's offering our bodies to God as a living sacrifice.。
And then it goes on and says...。
I'm not going to go into the modern of this world but watch this.。
Be transformed by the renewing of your mind.。
Then you'll be able to test and approve what God's will is.。
His good, pleasing and perfect will.。
So when your mind and body are out of alignment with any type of sin。
under the sun, the world says listen to your mind and do whatever your。
body wants.。
But check this out.。
The word says embrace your body but renew your mind.。
Now I just want to point out something, man.。
This is a normative practice in the medical field.。
So let me just not talk theological tonight.。
Let me just talk logical.。
Mind renewal, bringing our mind in alignment with our body is a。
normative practice in the medical field.。
Here's an example.。
If an 80-pound teenager walks into the doctor's office and says,。
doc, I feel overweight.。
And she's anorexic.。
The doctor is not going to sit there and say, well,。
if your mind is telling you that, then let's get you on diet pills.。
Let's give liposuction.。
Let's have stomach binding surgery.。
He would never do that.。
A loving doctor would say, hey, let's go to work on the mind to。
match the body instead of changing the body to match the mind.。
That's what a loving doctor would do.。
This is mind renewal.。
And as we understand that over time, this is what can happen when there's a。
dysphoria between the mind and the body.。
Embrace your body but renew your mind.。
And by the power of the Holy Spirit, the God of the galaxies begins to show。
you that there's another way that leads to life and not death.。
Proverbs 14.12 says there's a way that seems right to man or woman and that。
way ends in death.。
Just this week, the Atlantic, look it up on Google,。
came out with an article that says fewer sex partners means happier marriage.。
I just love it when the world catches up with the Bible.。
Don't you just love that?。
It's like, really?。
Like what the Bible has said for thousands of years.。
Fewer sex partners will actually give you more satisfaction in marriage.。
Hmm, sounds familiar, doesn't it?。
The world's going to try to tell you that you need to do you.。
Whatever makes you feel loved, accepted, celebrated.。
You need to get out there and make yours.。
Make a name for yourself.。
I want you to know that the gospel still has the power to change.。
Passing the baton of our faith happens when we trust the gospel is enough to。
reach our generation.。
Lesson four, community is greater than my comforts and conveniences.。
Young adults come up to me, every service usually,。
and I listen to their story.。
And 99.9% of the time I usually respond with something like this.。
Are you in biblical community?。
To which they would say, well, Josiah, it's hard.。
To which I say, but so is isolation and living in a prison to your secret sins.。
Well, it's a lot of work.。
And I'll say, well, so is your job.。
I don't really have time.。
But, bro, you work out every day and your screen time says five hours.。
Like, help me understand.。
Community is greater than our comforts and conveniences.。
Having biblical community is the number one piece of advice that I've given to。
people who want to change their life outside of telling them about Jesus and。
the gospel, why?。
Because 1 Corinthians 1533 says this, do not be misled.。
Bad company corrupts good character.。
Proverbs 13 says walk with the wise and become wise for a companion of fools。
suffers harm.。
You already know this, man.。
If you get drunk going to the bar, then stop going to the bar.。
If you have sex with him every time you go to his apartment,。
then stop going into his apartment.。
Ever.。
Like, my wife and I had to do this.。
Like, thank the Lord we weren't having sex.。
But we were getting handsy.。
I'm just being honest.。
And I had to look at my community group in the eyes and say,。
what's the solution to which they said quit being alone with them.。
Well, I want to be alone.。
Be alone in public.。
You better stay some late nights in Starbucks.。
For real.。
