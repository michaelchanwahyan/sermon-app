She was more like a beauty queen from the movie scene.。
Baby, don't mind what you do to me.。
I am the one who will dance on the floor and run.。
She told me, girl, it was Billie Jean.。
And she calls the scene.。
And every head turned with eyes that dream of being the one who。
will dance on the floor and run.。
People always told me, be careful what you do.。
Don't go around bringing young girls home.。
And mother always told me, don't go around bringing。
young girls home.。
And mother always told me, be careful who you love.。
Be careful what you do.。
Because a lie becomes a truth.。
Hey.。
