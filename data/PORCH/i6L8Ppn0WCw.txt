(upbeat music)。
- Hey Dallas, it's great to be with you.。
Fort Worth, much love to you from afar。
and everyone else that's listening in。
from around the country.。
It's great to be with you tonight.。
I wanna start by asking you a question.。
Has anyone ever heard of Cannacock?。
(audience cheering)。
Strong response.。
I had never heard of it, I've gotta confess.。
But then I did hear of it when I came around some folks。
who had been involved there。
and came to appreciate the place's influence.。
Finally got a chance to go.。
If you don't know what this is,。
I wanna bring everyone together.。
It's a Christian camp in Branson, Missouri.。
It's a beautiful piece of land and property.。
And I got a chance to go there.。
JP was invited to teach.。
I got invited to go and hold the bags and open the doors。
and maybe tell like a joke or two.。
And so we end up there at Cannacock together。
and he is preaching at a young adults gathering.。
And so we're there to set the scene.。
It's a chapel on the side of a mountain.。
It's absolutely beautiful.。
And so the worship felt great.。
The room, the community felt cozy.。
It was probably 70 or 80 guys or girls。
who all knew each other.。
And afterward, so worship happens,。
JP teaches, worship song to close, pretty standard fare.。
And then afterward, it kind of starts to break up.。
People start to get into circles and talk.。
And at the end of that, I find myself up near the front,。
near the worship leader, JP and he were talking.。
I found myself not really a key player in the discussion.。
And so I kind of started to back up and look around。
and I saw the guy's guitar sitting right there on a stand.。
And now I love guitars.。
I'm not good at guitar.。
That's not where this is going.。
There's a reason why I was invited to visit。
after the worship part was already over tonight.。
But I know how to hold one.。
Like I enjoy it, like it's fun.。
And so I saw an opportunity sitting right there.。
It was also beautiful.。
I didn't really, I wasn't able to appreciate。
how beautiful at the time.。
And so I, but I asked the question,。
which feels pretty standard amongst guitar players.。
Not that he knew I was one such person,。
but I asked him, "Hey, can I play your guitar?"。
And he said, "Yes."。
But it was one of those yeses。
that didn't really give you a confidence。
that it was a yes in here.。
You know, it was kind of,。
there was like some strings attached.。
It was like, "Yeah, sure."。
And even JP kind of, when I asked him,。
he kind of turned his head a little faster。
than he normally would.。
I was like, "These guys need to loosen up.。
"Give me this thing."。
And so I picked it up,。
thinking I'm gonna demonstrate and just redeem myself.。
And so I start to play it a little bit。
and I'm really enjoying it.。
I mean, it's beautiful, but,。
and so I'm playing it and they continue to talk,。
but I still feel like they're watching me a little bit.。
So it's making me more nervous than anything.。
So I'm not really able to enjoy the thing.。
So I put it down and we walk outside.。
And as soon as we walk outside the chapel,。
I look left and JP's right there.。
And I looked at him。
and as if to say, "What was going on in there?"。
And before I got a chance to ask that question,。
he said, "That guitar cost $20,000."。
Well, you should get me two for Christmas then。
and see if they're that good of a deal.。
So $20,000 was the cost of this guitar.。
And I had no idea about that.。
And some more information starts to kind of come available。
about the guitars.。
He said, "Yeah, it's made of sunken redwood."。
And so what that means is it's wood。
that's been compressed by a creek.。
They literally dig it out from under a creek。
because wood that's been compressed like that。
makes a beautiful sound.。
I didn't know any of this.。
And so the guitar is literally a masterpiece,。
like as in best guitar in the world kind of thing.。
And so I realized in that moment,。
I hadn't been reckless with the guitar.。
I didn't try to damage it or anything,。
but I definitely underappreciated it。
because I approached it with such confidence.。
I was overconfident.。
I assumed more and I approached it with a familiarity。
that just wasn't really healthy。
and wasn't helpful for the value that the guitar had.。
And so at the end of it,。
I didn't really feel angry or embarrassed.。
I did feel like I had missed out。
because I had held more guitar than I will ever hold again.。
I will see Jesus before I hold a guitar again.。
That that has that.。
Okay, so for perspective,。
that's twice as much as my Honda Civic.。
That would buy half of my college degree.。
If I drop it, I have a new mortgage.。
You with me?。
I mean, this is scary.。
And so instead, normally,。
if I had known that on the front end,。
if I had realized what I was approaching was that valuable,。
I wouldn't have treated it as if it was so familiar,。
so routine, so easy, so nonchalantly.。
And so instead, at the end,。
then I would have instead approached it, enjoyed it more.。
And then I would have been able to appreciate it.。
And then instead, I was left feeling like。
I couldn't even remember what that was like.。
And I missed out.。
I missed the experience of the guitar.。
And here's why that's our starting point for tonight.。
Because if you have any exposure whatsoever。
to the story of Jesus,。
even if you're not really a church person or a Bible person,。
if you've heard of Jesus,。
you've probably heard him associated。
with this thing called the cross.。
And know that that's somehow central。
to the message of Jesus.。
And it absolutely is.。
It's the most valuable part of his story, of his life,。
second maybe only to the resurrection.。
And so I think that we're in danger。
of missing out in the cross what I missed out on the guitar.。
And that's this, that the cross is so familiar to us,。
it's so routine to us, we see it everywhere,。
that it is difficult for us to appreciate。
what is actually being communicated to us from it.。
How valuable it is, how worth it, how worthy it is,。
how precious that it actually is.。
And I think that's due to familiarity.。
Think about all the places you see the cross.。
It's all over the place.。
You see it on walls, you see it hanging around.。
We beautify it, we encrust it with jewels,。
and we make it really decorative,。
and we try to make it pretty,。
and we put it on our necks, and we put it on our wrists,。
and we put it on our T-shirts.。
It's like how did it get on the back pockets of your jeans?。
What is the cross doing there?。
And so it has somehow become like ubiquitous.。
I mean, it's everywhere,。
and it continues to seem to lose its meaning a little bit.。
Because that's what happens。
when something becomes increasingly familiar.。
As we stop approaching it as if it's worthwhile and valuable.。
And if there's any symbol in the history of the world,。
big statement, if there's any symbol。
in the history of the world。
that's lost its original connotation,。
its original meaning, it's the cross.。
The cross was an instrument of torture.。
It was designed to produce the most excruciating death ever.。
It would be akin to like the electric chair,。
or the gallows, or the guillotine.。
And so if you wanna get a little closer to the cross,。
imagine instead of coming into like a church,。
where I grew up there was a cross in the background,。
but there was like the podium,。
and then there was the cross.。
And so imagine walking into an environment like that,。
and instead of seeing a cross,。
you see an electric chair sitting there on stage.。
Or imagine coming out of the children's wing。
of Vacation Bible School,。
or Vacation Bible School,。
and instead of seeing people。
with little crosses made out of yarn,。
and little decorative crosses around their necks,。
instead they've got hangman's nooses。
hanging around their neck.。
And they come up and say,。
"Hey, mommy, look what they taught me today.。
"Now we're getting warm."。
That is the original connotation of the cross.。
And so what I wanna do,。
and so it's so easy for us to be so confident。
on this subject, it's so easy.。
And I know the skeptic wants to rise up,。
and so, because I know how it is, man.。
It's like, you went to work,。
I'm not sure if I'm going to the porch.。
Okay, I'm going to the porch.。
I park, it's so far away.。
I came in, oh, it's so cloudy, it's still cloudy.。
I come in, it's crowded again,。
and I go through the worship,。
and it's like, it's really loud.。
And then the message comes on,。
"It's not even JP."。
(congregation laughing)。
And then we're talking about the cross,。
we're talking Jesus 101, okay?。
But I wanna tell you, I wanna call all those things,。
and so, come on, come with me.。
And so, I'm gonna go ahead and call all those things。
barriers for you tonight.。
I'm gonna call all those assumptions,。
and all that confidence, and all that skepticism,。
and all that, I already know this,。
I'm gonna lump all that together,。
and I'm gonna write on that bag barriers,。
and I'm gonna invite you with me to put that outside,。
and instead come ready to see the cross in a new way.。
So that's what we're gonna do tonight.。
(congregation applauding)。
So I wanna show you three things specifically tonight.。
First, that the cross anchors in history.。
I'll tell you what that means.。
First, that the cross anchors in history.。
Secondly, that the cross defeats all sin.。
I'll give you three specific ways that it does that,。
and that second point, and then lastly,。
that the cross ends all fear, it ends all fear.。
So that's where we'll finish tonight, that's the roadmap.。
And so first, the cross anchors in history.。
What does it mean that the cross anchors in history?。
Well, to understand what that means,。
I wanna give you a definition tonight for the cross.。
And when I'm saying the cross,。
I don't mean the symbol tonight.。
When I say the cross, I don't even mean。
the actual instrument, the actual wooden thing.。
What I mean is a scene, I mean an event.。
And so when you hear me say the cross,。
what I mean is an event, an actual historical event。
that really happened.。
And that's important because somehow,。
in spiritual matters in our day and age,。
it seems really popular.。
When it comes to spiritual matters。
and we really start to dive in,。
when we see something of spiritual significance,。
for some reason we wanna picture it as ethereal。
or mystical or kinda cloudy and fuzzy and out there,。
but the cross is something that actually happened。
in real history.。
Like if you went far enough mileage-wise。
and were able to go back far enough time-wise,。
you could show up.。
It's just as real as the fact that you woke up this morning,。
that you went to the ATM yesterday,。
that the War of 1812 happened,。
nobody knows much about that,。
that doesn't really prompt a response,。
but that Columbus sailed the ocean blue,。
all of these things are real.。
I'm giving you all these images。
and they all have one thing in common,。
they're real events that really happened in history.。
In three dimensions, people with real feelings。
took part in these things.。
And the cross does not operate in some separate sphere,。
it's real, it's tangible.。
If you had shown up, are you ready for this?。
If you had shown up and seen it,。
you could have captured it with an iPhone,。
you could have recorded it.。
So when you see something memorable,。
out comes the iPhone, you start to record.。
And the reason I know that。
is because the very best recording technology of the day。
was ink on paper, and that's exactly what they used。
to bring this history to us.。
And so as we approach the cross,。
I wanna tell you it's a historical thing,。
it's a real thing, and it's a brutal thing.。
And so the Romans perfected the cross。
as an execution method.。
And so it was called 1,000 deaths in one.。
It wasn't something you talked about casually。
before Sunday lunch, it was more like something。
the mothers would cover their kids ears at.。
And in fact, the cross did not become。
the symbol of Christianity,。
until everyone who had actually seen one had died.。
Until there was no more living memory whatsoever。
of the cross, it did not become the symbol of Christianity。
because the connotation was too gruesome.。
It's a real thing, it was anchored in history.。
I wanna give you a verse for that before we move on.。
It's 1 Corinthians 15, three through four,。
it goes like this.。
"For I delivered to you as of first importance。
"what I also received."。
Okay, pause, what does that sound like?。
This is history, he's taking it, I'm passing it on.。
I'm taking what I first heard of first importance。
and I'm delivering it on to you.。
I'm not modifying it, I'm not creating it,。
I'm not getting creative when I pass this history on to you,。
I'm taking it and I'm giving it on to you.。
That's the only way to pass on accurate history,。
and that's exactly the spirit。
that is taken by the New Testament.。
The New Testament does not treat the cross。
as if it's mystical, it treats it as if it's real.。
And so I pass these things on to you as of first importance。
that Christ died, there's your cross,。
Christ died for our sins.。
In accordance with the scriptures,。
that he was buried and rose on the third day。
in accordance with the scriptures.。
The cross anchors in history.。
My second point this evening。
is that the cross defeats all sin.。
The cross defeats all sin.。
And so I wanna give you three ways,。
they all start with P in this section,。
that the cross defeats all sin.。
It has to do with the penalty of sin,。
the power of sin and the presence of sin.。
So we're gonna go through that together.。
So the cross removes the penalty of sin.。
And before I even tell you what that means,。
it feels like that could be news,。
like that there's sin and that there's a penalty.。
And so that can catch you by surprise.。
And then, oh, there's this thing that's called sin,。
there's this, then I have a penalty to pay,。
and whoa, it's already paid.。
That would be like, imagine for a second。
that you come home from work and you show up。
and your roommate's there, they're looking right at you.。
And they say, "Hey, I paid your bill."。
Like, who are you, what have you done with my roommate?。
I have a great roommate, by the way,。
it would not be unusual.。
But imagine that your roommate says to you,。
"I paid your bill."。
It's like, oh man, that's great, thank you.。
What bill did you pay?。
Water?。
40 bucks?。
No?。
Did you pay the electricity?。
90 bucks?。
I know you didn't pay the rent.。
I want you to imagine he looks back at you and says,。
"I paid your taxes."。
The ones you didn't know about?。
Yeah, the IRS called, 100,000, paid.。
Just for you, free gift.。
Penalty you didn't know you had,。
that you couldn't pay, paid.。
Free gift, that's it.。
You would respond a little bit differently。
than if they paid the water bill.。
You would respond strongly because there is freedom now。
from a penalty that would have been imposed upon you.。
And so Romans chapter three, verse 23,。
this is a familiar verse for some.。
It says, "For all have sinned。
"and fall short of the glory of God."。
All, and so I'm not a Greek scholar,。
I wanna give you that confession.。
I'm not a Greek scholar.。
I am confident that if we did a word study of the word all,。
it would come back A-L-L, all.。
Like, all have sinned, every single one of us have sinned。
and fallen short of the glory of God,。
and are, but, but are justified by his grace。
as a free gift, penalty paid.。
And so I wanna show you something in this next paragraph。
that's worth underlining, it's worth paying attention to.。
Not just that the penalty is paid,。
but actually the method through which it was done.。
And so this is the next verse.。
It says, "This was to show God's righteousness."。
What's his righteousness?。
Just his rightness, his perfection, his rightness.。
"This," this cross, "was to show God's rightness。
"because in his divine forbearance," his patience,。
"he had passed over former sins."。
Okay, so here's what that means.。
"At the beginning of history,。
"when human beings started to sin,"。
because remember, all human beings have sinned。
and fallen short of the glory of God,。
beginning with the very first one.。
And so as soon as human beings started to sin,。
God didn't just start unleashing justice on them。
as soon as they did.。
Although that would have, that would not,。
he would not have ceased to be God and be good。
if he had done that.。
He wasn't just unleashing the arrows of justice。
every time somebody would sin.。
Instead, he waited, he passed over former sins.。
And when it was time to let the arrow of justice fly,。
he pointed it at the one person。
who had never done anything wrong ever.。
And so for all of humanity,。
for everyone who has ever lived and ever sinned,。
he passed over those sins until the time that Jesus came.。
It says, "This was to show his righteousness。
"at the present time," that's at the time of the cross,。
"so that he might be,"。
and these next four words are huge,。
"just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus."。
The just and the justifier.。
This arrangement happened so that God。
could be the just and the justifier.。
What does that mean?。
At the cross, you might have heard this before,。
at the cross, we see an intersection。
of two things really vividly.。
We see God's love and we see God's justice.。
We see God's love and we see God's justice.。
Justice, let's talk about first.。
Justice is something that means。
it's just simply to right the wrongs.。
To make wrong things right, that's what justice is.。
That's what judges do.。
That's what good ones do.。
And sometimes we wanna come down on God for his justice.。
It makes us a little uncomfortable inside.。
But I just wanna remind us。
that good judges make wrong things right.。
In the state of Texas,。
if judges don't make wrong things right,。
you fire them, okay, like they're done.。
And so we all know that good judges make wrong things right.。
This is exactly what God does.。
You can see that at the cross.。
Look at the man on it, he's crushed.。
The one from whom this punishment came。
must have been very serious about the wrong that was done.。
You can see the justice that's carried out there.。
You can also see God's love at the cross。
because oh yeah, that's not any of us on it。
who deserved it, who should have been there.。
And so what the phrase means, just and the justifier,。
is that God didn't come down to earth。
just to be exactly right.。
God praised God that he did not come all the way down here。
just to be exactly right.。
He came down here and was exactly right。
and made all the wrong people right.。
Set them right with him.。
That's what it means to justify someone,。
to set them right, to give them right standing before God.。
And so at the cross, you see Jesus。
pinned by God's justice out of God's love for us。
so that God might be shown to be both just。
and the justifier.。
There are, you think there's more at the cross。
than you thought there was?。
It's four words in your Bible.。
It's amazing.。
So the cross removes the penalty of sin.。
The cross also removes the power of sin.。
You ever felt like sin was gonna have its。
final way over you?。
You ever felt like sin just had its ultimate power over you,。
like the strongest force in your life was sin?。
And so before you know it, you look up。
and you start to think things like this.。
Narcissism and self-centeredness will always。
have its way over me.。
Porn will always be a part of my life.。
It just will be.。
Anger and losing self-control, it's just gonna mark me.。
That's what it sounds like to feel like。
sin has its ultimate power over you.。
And that's about as hopeless as it gets.。
To think that your entire future is gonna be marked out。
by either a past history or a present tendency。
because of the power of sin is going to affect。
your entire future.。
To feel marked in that way is about as hopeless。
as I can possibly imagine.。
I've been there.。
Thought all those things.。
And they are lies.。
And I know that because of what Romans chapter six says.。
This is verse six.。
It says, "We know that our old self was crucified with him."。
Okay, our old self, that's the part, you know,。
that was not able not to sin.。
Not able not to sin, but that old self。
that was captive to sin was crucified, there's the cross,。
pinned to the cross associated with Jesus.。
So the part of you that was powerless,。
the part of you that was unable to keep from sinning。
was pinned onto the cross with Jesus.。
Why?。
"In order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing。
"so that we," that's you and I,。
Porch, Dallas, Fort Worth,。
"so that the body of sin that used to mark us。
"would be brought to nothing,。
"so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.。
"For one who has died has been set free from sin."。
So the part of you that was enslaved to sin。
is associated strongly with Jesus。
and completely with Jesus on the cross.。
And so today, sin's power over you is gone.。
If you're in Christ, if you trusted in Christ。
for the forgiveness of your sins,。
and trusted in his death and resurrection。
and his work on your behalf,。
that means sin does not have to mark you today or any day.。
To put it as simply as possible,。
you don't have to do those things anymore.。
That's the beauty of the cross.。
And the separating power of shame is done.。
The separating power, this is what sin does.。
This is its greatest tool, it's to separate us from God.。
It's what it does and it's its result.。
And instead, Christ brings us back。
and through the power of his death on the cross,。
gives us an all-access pass back to God.。
That's good news.。
A couple of years ago, I was in Atlanta。
for a gathering of Christians at a conference.。
And so I'd never done that before.。
I trusted Christ when I was about 20 years old.。
And I'd never really gone to a big gathering。
of Jesus followers.。
That was not really my scene.。
And, but we showed up in Atlanta for this gathering.。
I was a new believer in Christ and we get there。
and I would find out later。
that there were gonna be 20,000 people at this event.。
It was gonna be at Phillips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia,。
where the Hawks play.。
And so, that's the Atlanta, oh wait, is it Hawks?。
Yes, the Atlanta Hawks, sorry.。
I'm not really a basketball person, forgive me.。
So we show up and we think, we drove all through the night.。
So we drove midnight, this is January 1st, 2010.。
We drove from midnight to noon。
to get from Dallas to Atlanta.。
And so we get there, the conference doesn't start。
until seven and we thought, well, we'll get there。
about an hour and a half, maybe two hours early。
to make sure we get a really good seat.。
Instead, we crash, wake up and then realize,。
okay, the event starts in a few minutes。
and we're a mile away from the site.。
And so we're gonna crash, wake up,。
and then we're gonna crash, wake up,。
and then we're gonna crash, wake up,。
and then we're gonna crash, wake up,。
and then we're gonna crash, wake up,。

There's nothing better than that.。
So we'll respond to you now,。
just by saying thank you to you from our hearts,。
that you bought us back from the penalty,。
the power, and the presence of sin.。
You've ended our fears, and we can rest tonight,。
maybe for the first time in a long time.。
Whether we're in Dallas or in the Ridgely Theater,。
whether we've got headphones in our ears,。
we're watching on a phone or a TV,。
we can rest right now,。
because the word that Jesus spoke is alive today.。
