(upbeat music)。
- All right, let's go.。
Welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth,。
Houston, El Paso, Austin, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,。
Tulsa, Woodlands, Phoenix, San Antonio.。
The left one out, welcome to you.。
Hey, wherever you're joining us from,。
and especially friends in the room,。
we are kicking off a new series called Mood,。
which is a look at human emotions。
from a biblical perspective.。
Emotions are something that all of us deal with,。
all of us experience, they have a big impact on our life.。
So for the next six weeks,。
we're gonna cover what a biblical perspective。
on how to handle and think about really your emotions。
and really look at several different specific emotions。
week after week.。
So that's where we're headed tonight.。
We're just gonna do kind of an overview.。
And to get there, I'm gonna launch in by bringing up。
what I think is the best part of living in 2019。
as it relates to emotions.。
And that is that we have developed a new way。
of communicating our emotions that is called the emoji.。
That we have gone from, I don't know,。
like when you started texting,。
this was at one point like the thing。
that if you've got an emoji text message from somebody,。
it's kind of like, oh my gosh, this person is a psychopath.。
And now it's just like we all do.。
We don't even use words anymore,。
we're just sending happy faces or different signs.。
So I put together some of my favorites。
as it relates to emojis.。
Here's one that I feel like is most commonly used.。
Here's what's interesting about this one.。
This is meant to represent the laugh 'til you cry emoji.。
No one is ever laughing 'til they cry when they send this.。
Have you noticed this?。
Like I've been in meetings with people on my team,。
I don't wanna call them out, Brittany, but.。
(congregation laughing)。
No, it wasn't Brittany, I'm sure it was Emily.。
Hey, anyways, we're in the meeting。
and people will like send a text message to one another。
and I'll be on that group text and they'll make some joke。
and I literally, I see everyone,。
we're all sitting in a circle,。
supposed to be paying attention。
and they'll do like the laugh out like four of these。
as though they're dying, crying, laughing 'til they cry。
and they don't even make like a smirk.。
They don't even do anything.。
It's like the most exaggerated expression of this.。
Here's another one that we have。
as it relates to emojis, hands up, praise.。
Gotta love this one.。
This is something that I feel like at least guys。
would never actually do this in real life。
where someone tells you some good news,。
you're like yes, yes.。
(congregation laughing)。
Maybe some of you would。
and there's always hope for those of you.。
The next one that I thought would be worth bringing up。
was oh yeah, the heart face.。
Of course, this is always an interesting one。
when you get it from like another dude。
and you're like I don't,。
or like somebody who's older that just doesn't text that much。
and like I don't think you know what this is.。
I think communicating here when you send that.。
Or another one being the hand on the face, of course.。
What was I thinking?。
Or the just straight up,。
I'm not even totally sure what this next one is.。
With the teeth going straight out.。
Like I don't know if that's angry。
or is it just there's a lot of reaction though。
as though this group knows what it's for.。
And then of course the most famous。
or infamous of all the emojis。
and that would be the poop emoji.。
Whatever person at Apple decided。
we need to put eyeballs on this thing。
felt like hey, we're gonna send that one back.。
Tell them to put eyes on it.。
That'll make it perfect.。
Just feels like they've got too much time on their hands.。
But although we've developed new ways of communicating。
what we're feeling and what we're experiencing。
and some of it's helpful and some of it's not。
and some of it's honestly not that accurate,。
what has not changed。
is that we communicate it through new mediums,。
the human experience and human emotion。
and our experience of just the spectrum of emotions。
has not.。
For thousands of years people。
and the part of emotions being just a part of everyday life,。
it was a part of today, your work,。
it's a part of the relationships you have,。
it's a part of every single one of us。
inside of this room and everyone listening.。
That emotions, although 2019 we've developed new ways。
to communicate them,。
the idea of emotions and the human experience of emotion。
is nothing new.。
And so we're gonna launch into this series。
to cover really what God would have for you。
as it relates to emotions。
'cause candidly there's a lot of confusion。
around this topic.。
Our world today, as much as any time I can ever remember。
since I've been alive,。
is a place where it's a very confusing world。
where hey, feelings mean more than anything to many people.。
And at the same time, God is not anti-feelings.。
And though it would be wrong to say hey, feelings are God,。
what is true is that feelings are from God。
and God created us with emotion。
and so we're gonna launch into just tonight。
an overview of how you and I should understand emotions。
'cause there's a lot of confusion。
and unlike very few issues,。
maybe more than any other issue in your life,。
your emotions are gonna significantly impact。
the future you're gonna have.。
Our emotions impact the decisions that we make.。
Our emotions impact a lot of our greatest regrets。
were made out of an emotional response.。
I was afraid of X so I made the decision.。
Our emotions are a key part of any healthy relationship.。
If you're gonna have a relationship,。
you've gotta know how to keep your emotions in check,。
how to process 'em, what to do with 'em,。
how to handle 'em, how to communicate 'em,。
how to identify 'em.。
If you're gonna succeed at work, I mean think about it,。
you can't be effective wherever you end up working。
if you can't control your emotion.。
Like nobody is giving loose cannon Lisa a promotion.。
If you can't learn how to control your emotions,。
you're not gonna progress and you won't last long anywhere.。
And God who's there wants you to know。
how you can control, communicate,。
identify all the different things,。
how to operate with your emotions.。
And then the last thing I'd say。
is just there's a lot of confusion, candidly,。
that's been introduced at times in the church.。
Where sometimes emotions in church specifically。
can be given a bad rap.。
As though God is anti-feeling。
or he doesn't want us to listen to our feelings。
and if you are listening to your feelings,。
you should disregard that and just follow your faith。
as though those are opposite always.。
Or they're pitted against one another.。
Or hey, feelings need to be replaced with truth。
as though those are always opposite.。
At times they certainly are but at times they're not.。
So how should we think about feelings?。
So tonight we're gonna just open up this series。
by looking at an overview。
of how to understand human emotions.。
So I'm gonna go through three different ideas。
that we see inside of the scriptures。
that will cover as it relates to emotions,。
how to think about it.。
This, in just reading a few books for this message。
this past week was so helpful in ministry to me.。
So hopefully it's gonna be really helpful.。
I think for some of us, if you listen and apply,。
just like myself, it will be life-changing for you。
because you came into this room right now。
and you are governed by emotion.。
You're overwhelmed, you're struggling to even listen to me。
because of the things that you're feeling。
and you're gonna struggle to become。
all that God wants you to be and all that you can be。
if you're not someone who knows how to handle their emotions.。
So we're gonna look at three things.。
If you take notes, you can start with the first one。
and the first one is this.。
Emotions are a gift from God.。
Emotions are a gift from God.。
In other words, emotions are not a bad thing.。
Emotions are a gift.。
Emotions were given to us to enhance the human experience.。
They weren't given to be exalted.。
They weren't given to be excluded from life.。
They were given by God to enhance the human experience。
and particularly to move us out of that emotion.。
The word emotion comes from the Latin word mover, to move,。
and to move us in the direction of God.。
Think about life when I say enhanced.。
Think about what life would be like。
if you didn't experience emotion.。
I mean, think about the person who's getting engaged。
and their specialist, someone gets down on one knee。
or you get down on one knee and you propose。
and you feel nothing inside.。
You're like, I don't really care.。
Take it or leave it, I'm fine with this.。
You would be like, that person is dead on the inside.。
Life would not be as exciting as that.。
If you heard news of a family member who had cancer。
and then they came back from a doctor's scan。
and it was a clean bill of health.。
If someone didn't react, oh my gosh, I'm relieved.。
I feel something.。
You'd be like, that is just bizarre or weird.。
That emotions are a part of our relationships.。
If you don't get excited to be around other people,。
how dull would your relationships be?。
You wouldn't have friendships。
at the same degree and same level.。
That emotions bring out,。
it's as though they were the sixth sense, if you will.。
You have taste and feeling and smell and sight and hearing。
and then God has given us emotions。
to be a part of the human experience.。
Emotions are a gift further。
and that they're a reflection of the image of God.。
In other words, you were made in the image of God,。
in the image of a God who feels.。
You guys may not ever think about this stuff,。
but you know the Bible says that God feels things?。
Like how crazy and interesting is that?。
Like God has, as though it were a heart, if you will,。
he feels things.。
We're told in really tons of different places,。
but some of the things that God felt angered。
at the Israelites in Deuteronomy chapter one, verse 34,。
he felt pleased at Solomon's decision.。
In 1 Kings chapter three, verse 10,。
it says that he's filled with joy and gladness。
over his people and glad singing.。
The heart of God moves towards,。
in Zephaniah chapter three, verse 17,。
that God's heart grieves.。
In Genesis chapter six, verse six,。
Jesus was over and over again moved by emotion.。
Paul, the apostle, would say that in Ephesians chapter four,。
it is possible to grieve the Holy Spirit.。
Think about that.。
That the God who's there is not some cold, distant robot.。
He has emotions, and you were made in his image。
with emotions, and they're a gift that he has given。
to move you and to move you in the direction of him.。
Further, we're commanded in the New Testament。
to express emotions.。
Paul says in Romans 12,。
it's really all over the New Testament,。
but hey, rejoice with those who rejoice,。
mourn with those who mourn,。
that God says, hey, it is a command.。
I want my people to feel.。
So if you came in and you're like,。
hey, emotions are a bad thing,。
or emotions are just something I wish。
that I could get rid of,。
or emotions are something that God probably。
doesn't want me to listen to。
or ever have a part of my life,。
you have been misled.。
We say that, hey, it's,。
often you'll hear people say, like,。
hey, it's not okay to be led by emotion.。
That is wrong.。
It's not okay to be led by emotion to sin.。
Jesus was led by emotion.。
So before I get an email, it says,。
Jesus, in Mark chapter one,。
was moved by emotion and compassion。
towards a man who had leprosy.。
That he was moved over and over again.。
I mean, read your Bible.。
Jesus, over and over, was moved.。
What's another word for moved?。
Led.。
And moved him to act.。
Now, it's the wrong thing to be led。
always by emotions, and especially in the direction。
that goes opposite of God's will,。
but candidly, the problem is not emotions, it's sin.。
People will say things like,。
hey, you know, in that situation,。
my emotions got the better of me.。
The truth is, it wasn't your emotions,。
it's sin got the better of your emotions.。
That's what's taking place.。
Emotions are not a bad thing in and of themselves.。
But if they lead you to sin,。
is when it is wrong to be led by emotions.。
But emotions are this gift that God has given to all of us.。
The Bible says that in response,。
as it relates to the idea of,。
hey, they're to move us towards God.。
James chapter five, verse 13, says that,。
hey, is anyone joyful?。
Let him praise God and sing aloud.。
If anyone is afraid, even if you have negative emotions,。
God's hope is that all the different things。
that you felt today would be things。
that you would bring to him.。
Either lead you to respond and praise to him,。
or lead you to pray to him.。
It says that, hey, in Psalm 56,。
when I am afraid, when I am filled with fear,。
I trust and put my trust in you.。
So why do they feel not like a gift sometimes?。
Because sin.。
In other words, when God created the world,。
he created you and I and humanity。
with this ability to have emotions in our mind,。
in our will, and sin entered into the world。
through Adam and Eve and their decision,。
and when that happened, everything broke.。
And now, literally, everything on the planet。
has some assembly required, including your emotions.。
And so this gift that God has given you。
is one of those things that it doesn't just naturally,。
today, you can have emotions that will lead you to craziness.。
And if you follow the sinful emotions,。
they're gonna take you down a path。
that you don't wanna go to.。
So today, because sin has entered into the world,。
the gift of human emotion is one of those gifts。
that just kinda requires, it's some assembly required.。
There's things that God, thankfully, in his word,。
has said this is how you would operate now。
with your emotions.。
You know what I mean by some assembly?。
Anyone been given a gift recently。
that has some assembly required?。
Anyone given a gift from Ikea?。
You ever had that happen where it shows up at your door。
and you're like, oh my goodness,。
I'm gonna be doing this for the next seven days, okay?。
That's essentially what God has given us。
inside of your human emotions.。
And through the gospel and through following Jesus,。
that is a part of the thing that he says。
I'm here to reconcile and bring peace about to all things,。
your heart, your emotions, your mind,。
your relationships, and all things.。
And so for the next couple points,。
I wanna just talk about two more aspects。
of how that assembly takes place.。
And the starting point for that assembly。
is gonna be the second point, if you take notes,。
which is this, emotions are not just a gift,。
they are a gauge.。
Emotions are a gauge, you know what I mean by gauge?。
Like they tell you something.。
Just like a gauge on the dashboard of your car,。
it tells you, it indicates something.。
Emotions are meant to be an indicator,。
or they tell you something.。
Anytime that you feel something,。
it reflects something inside.。
And I'm gonna tell you exactly what I mean。
in case you're like, what does that have to do with my life?。
What are you talking about?。
In Proverbs 37, verse 19, it says this.。
As water reflects the face, so when you look in the water,。
you see the reflection of your face.。
So one's life, that's one's actions and emotions,。
reflects one's heart.。
In other words, what your life looks like,。
hey, how you act, how you feel,。
what emotions you're experiencing,。
what actions you do, are directly reflecting。
what's in your heart.。
In other words, you can see what's in your heart,。
but based on what emotions you're experiencing.。
And specifically, when it talks about a gauge,。
what are you reading,。
we're told that it reads two specific things.。
But before we go into that,。
when I, about a week or two ago,。
I was hanging out with my three-year-old son.。
We're sitting there, we're reading books on the couch.。
He loves books, he's so pumped about books,。
but he can't read.。
So we're sitting there and we're going through,。
and he's like, hey, what does this say over here?。
And one time, I don't know what I was thinking,。
but I was like, what do you think that says,。
or what does it say?。
And he looks at me point blank,。
and it was the greatest thing ever.。
He was like, I don't know, I can't read.。
(congregation laughing)。
I was like, I'm three, what are you asking me this for?。
I can't read.。
And then shortly after that, he began to talk about,。
I can't wait 'til the day that I can read books.。
I can sit on my bed and I can read all by myself.。
Hopefully that day comes,。
but even as important as that,。
is the day that comes for his ability to grow,。
to read emotions, to read his own emotions,。
to read the emotions of people around him.。
And though most of us learn at some point。
how to read and write, especially in America,。
tragically, very few of us ever learn。
how to read your emotions because they are a gauge.。
Whatever you're feeling right now。
is a gauge of what's going on inside of your heart,。
and specifically, it is a gauge of two things,。
and this is about to get heady.。
Everybody put their thinking cap on。
'cause I think this is gonna be。
profoundly helpful from God's word,。
but it'll take a little bit of thinking.。
What does it tell me?。
What is it reading?。
What is it a gauge of?。
Specifically, two things, your beliefs and your values.。
Anytime you have a human emotion,。
it reflects the intersection of something I value,。
I care about, that I find worth or a desire of mine,。
and something I believe.。
Every single time, there's a human expression.。
I think we've got a slide that'll put this up.。
So every single time, in other words, there's a value,。
there's something that, if I don't see it as valuable,。
I'm not gonna experience a human emotion.。
When I see a squirrel running in the middle of the street,。
I feel nothing.。
I'm dead on the inside.。
When I see a child, and this is not anti-squirrel,。
I'm just being honest, people, good grief.。
Thought this was a safe place.。
Bunch of squirrel hippies out here.。
When I see a squirrel running in the middle of the street,。
I'm like, I don't care, this car's coming,。
and they do it all the time, good luck.。
When I see a child, good grief, squirrel,。
is this a PETA gathering?。
When I see a child running in the street,。
I move with emotion, get out of the road,。
because I value it more than a squirrel.。
When I see my child, I'm very moved with emotion。
to act and get out of the way and fear and panic。
and all those emotions go through my heart,。
because it's a value thing.。
If you don't value something, if you don't care about it,。
if you have no worth that you find it,。
then you're not gonna experience。
any sort of emotion to that.。
The same is true as it relates to beliefs.。
That in order for you to experience emotion,。
you've gotta have, it's wherever the intersection。
and overlap of beliefs and values take place.。
What do I mean by belief?。
What you believe about a circumstance,。
what you think is kinda going on,。
will impact how your emotions are affected.。
What's an example?。
This past weekend, if you were to go to lunch。
with your mother on Mother's Day,。
'cause you're a great son or daughter,。
and you were to call her up and you said,。
hey, I'll meet you at this restaurant,。
we're going to lunch, and you went。
and you got to that restaurant and you waited。
and you were supposed to meet there at 12,。
and all of a sudden it's like 12, 20,。
and you've texted her several times,。
you're calling her, her phone won't answer.。
If you believe that she has gotten in a wreck。
or an accident, you're gonna be moved towards panic。
and I need to go find her and what should I do?。
If you believe she's stuck in traffic。
and that her phone is dead 'cause she never charges it,。
you're gonna just get back on your phone。
and keep sending emojis.。
You're not gonna be moved in the same way.。
Every single time, this is so huge,。
and this is going somewhere, because candidly,。
if I just said, hey, if you're sad in here,。
stop feeling sad!。
That may be like, oh, motivational,。
or yeah, that's a great idea.。
It's not gonna work.。
Because if you don't get to what the Bible。
in Hebrews chapter four says is the thoughts。
or beliefs and desires of the heart,。
and go at those with God's word,。
you will not experience freedom or any victory。
in the battle against your emotions.。
So you've gotta understand the battle。
or the battlefront that you are fighting on.。
And it is related to beliefs and emotions。
every single time, that your emotions are a gauge。
that tell you what is taking place on the inside.。
So let's use a couple examples.。
Let's say you go to a wedding,。
and this past weekend you're at a wedding,。
it's one of your friends, and you're single。
and not dating anyone, and they put you。
at the singles table, and you're watching everybody。
dance over there, and it's your roommate,。
just got married.。
Maybe you're the only one left in kind of your squad,。
friend group, who's not married yet.。
And you begin to be filled with sadness.。
That's an emotion, the feeling of sadness.。
What am I believing?。
Could be a number of different things.。
But let's just continue with the illustration.。
Likely what you value is getting married,。
and staying up with the stage of life your friends are in.。
You're like, oh man, I don't wanna be behind.。
Everybody else is kinda moving on with their life.。
I'm just 33 and single, it's moving on for me.。
So that's the thing that you value,。
and the belief you have could be any number of things,。
but likely it's something like I believe,。
and I'm afraid that I may always be single.。
Maybe you're sad 'cause you're like,。
I think God is punishing me for my past.。
Maybe you think, man, I should've married him,。
that one that got away, because there's an intersection。
of what you believe and what you value.。
Every time there's a human emotion,。
it is connected to these two things.。
Which is a very important thing.。
If you are going to learn to fight, and battle,。
and win in the human emotion,。
it is gonna take place by doing this.。
What's another example?。
Maybe you're at work, and your team is together,。
and they're asking for ideas for some new problem。
you're trying to solve, and you throw one out there.。
The response you get is kind of like,。
anybody else have any ideas, or it's dismissed,。
or it's even like, that's a terrible idea.。
You're gonna leave that meeting,。
and you're gonna feel emotion.。
You're gonna feel embarrassed, and anxious。
over whether or not I'm gonna have a job here much longer.。
Those are the emotions you're gonna feel.。
And why?。
Because there's a belief and a value。
that is a part of those things.。
You believe that you're anxious or embarrassed,。
that maybe, hey, I just ruined my shot,。
I'm not gonna get promoted around here,。
my boss thinks I'm incompetent or dumb.。
That's what you believe.。
And you value your job, you value what your boss thinks.。
You guys following me on this?。
Every single time that you experience an emotion,。
it is connected, even if it's a positive emotion.。
And the degree to which you experience that emotion。
is directly related to the degree of the emotion,。
or the degree of the belief and the value.。
The greater the value, and the greater the belief,。
or my perception of what's happening is,。
the greater the emotion.。
So you go back to my child running in the street,。
just like from a squirrel to another child to my child,。
that ramps up my emotion.。
And the greater likelihood of belief that I have。
that there's a car coming fast will increase my emotion.。
You guys following me on this?。
I know thinking caps are on.。
If you checked out, come back in.。
And know this, that if you're gonna experience freedom,。
it's gonna be related to you knowing,。
because the Bible says, it uses these words,。
your beliefs or your values, your beliefs and your values,。
are directly behind what your heart is expressing.。
And that's why the Bible says you and I。
have got to learn to combat them with God's word.。
And I'm gonna tell you a story.。
