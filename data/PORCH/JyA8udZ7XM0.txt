Sometimes in life you look at things and。
you just kind of see a mess.。
And inside you're like, I think it's supposed to be beautiful.。
Maybe it's a dove. I don't know, man.。
Beauty's in the eyes of the beholder.。
Beauty's in the eyes of the beholder.。
Maybe it's something, maybe I'm missing it.。
Maybe everybody sees it.。
Some are acting like it's good.。
But I just, I don't know, it's kind of ugly.。
I don't get it.。
And then it gets flipped.。
How many of you, by show of hands, saw that coming?。
How many of you have seen that before。
and you knew it was something?。
Keep your hands up.。
So some of you, you've seen that illustration。
or you've seen Lance's gifts before。
and you're like, okay, I know what's going to happen.。
I see Jesus' face there.。
I know how this is going to go down.。
Let me tell you something.。
Those of you that knew it was coming,。
you had a very different attitude than the rest of us.。
Because there towards the end,。
those of you that didn't see it coming,。
you started to feel embarrassed.。
You started like, oh man, I think he messed up。
or he's the big eraser, you know.。
Can we just start over?。
Shane, start singing again.。
Let's give this guy another shot.。
You feel bad for him.。
And you're like, oh no, things just went awry.。
That's what you were feeling.。
But those of you that knew what was coming,。
you felt something completely different.。
You thought, okay, just wait for it.。
Just wait for it, man. It's coming.。
It's going to be amazing.。
Life is that way.。
Life is that way for believers,。
you know God is going to do something good.。
You just need to wait.。
You just need to hold on. Hold fast.。
Wait for it. Wait for it. He's not done yet.。
He's going to make this good.。
He's going to make this right.。
You hold on with that hope.。
While others are looking at it,。
all I see is something ugly, man.。
So if you're here for the first time,。
we want to welcome you.。
Fort Worth, we want to welcome you.。
Houston, I know that you're streaming from your homes。
because of the flooding situation there.。
We welcome you guys. We're praying for you guys.。
If you're here with the Church Leaders Conference,。
welcome. We are talking tonight.。
We're going through a series, Romans 8,。
walking by the Spirit.。
We're talking tonight。
how God can flip。
everything for good.。
The scripture we're going to be in tonight。
is just where we're landing in this series.。
It just happens to be where we're at.。
It is overflowing with hope.。
It shows how God can flip the script。
in any given situation.。
If you're not in troubles right now,。
and you're like, "Well, I don't really need that right now.。
Life is good right now.。
I just got a raise,。
and I'm in a new relationship,。
and everything's working out."。
If that's where you're at right now, just wait.。
Jesus says, "In this world,。
you will have troubles."。
It's one of the promises He makes us.。
Troubles are coming your way, unbearable, unthinkable,。
unfathomable troubles.。
I'm not wishing that on you.。
That's not a prophecy or anything.。
As a matter of fact, if God gives you long enough,。
you are going to face sickness,。
death of loved ones,。
hurts, deep, deep,。
sorrowful hurts that you will need。
help getting through.。
This verse offers you the help.。
If that's where you're at right now,。
I hope you cling to every word in this verse.。
We're in Romans 8, if you want to turn there.。
I'm going to be in verse 28 through 30 this evening.。
Just as a reminder, Paul wrote this。
in about 57 AD。
to the church in Rome。
whom he had not met.。
There's a very turbulent culture。
going on in Rome as Paul writes this。
letter to them, offering them。
hope. Last week,。
David talked about how creation。
groans for the return of Christ。
and how the resurrection offers us this。
hope. Tonight, we're going to elaborate on that。
hope. I'll just read these verses.。
He says this in verse 28, "And we know。
that in all things God works for the good。
of those who love Him, who have been called。
according to His purpose.。
For those God foreknew, He also。
predestined to be conformed to the image。
of His Son, that He might be。
the firstborn among many brothers。
and sisters. And those He。
predestined, He also called. And those He called,。
He also justified. And those He justified,。
He also glorified."。
From these three verses, we're going to look at three promises。
from the text.。
How He makes good from our bad.。
What that good。
actually is.。
And how the best is yet to come.。
And so in。
verse 28, he says, "And we know。
in all things God works for the good。
of those who love Him, who have been。
called according to His purpose."。
My first point this evening is that God。
works the bad out for your good.。
God works the bad out for your good.。
Just hold on to that promise, okay?。
God works the bad out for。
your good. That is what He does. That is a。
promise to you from the Scriptures. It says。
this, we'll go section at a time, "We。
know." This is a very matter。
of fact for Christians. We know.。
We have this knowledge. It is a。
matter of fact to us. Like we know。
that gravity pulls us down. That we。
know the stars hang in the sky. That we know。
the grass is green. We know that。
God works all things。
for the good of those who love Him, who have been called。
according to His purpose. If you are here, you。
are a follower of Christ. This is a foundational。
truth to you. We know it.。
The Scripture says. Paul just talks about。
it like it's a matter of fact.。
What do we know? We know that God works in all。
things.。
Think about this. He hasn't just put。
you here to flail。
through life on your own. That you don't have help.。
But God, the Creator of the。
heavens and the earth. The one who spoke things。
into existence. The one who said。
it was and it was good.。
Is actively and intimately。
involved。
in your life right now. Involved in your。
relationships right now. Involved in your。
work right now. He knows。
you. He knows everything about you.。
Where you've been and where you're going.。
He's at work.。
In all those things.。
Specifically。
in your life.。
And He's working it out。
for your。
good.。
So He's。
working it out for your good.。
This is an unbelievable。
truth. And so here's what I'm telling you.。
If it doesn't seem。
good, He's not done.。
Because He's working it。
out for your good.。
So if what you have is not good, God's not。
finished.。
If it doesn't seem good, then He's not。
done. Right? And so this is what。
God is doing. And so I want to。
differentiate this from everything。
happens for a reason. That's the worldly version.。
Well, everything happens for a reason.。
That's also true.。
It's just not as hopeful. It's certainly。
not as helpful.。
Right? When my radio was stolen。
out of my car, car broken。
into, someone says, "Well, everything happens for a reason."。
I'm like, "I know the reason.。
They wanted my radio."。
That's not helpful.。
That gives me no hope. You're right.。
Everything happens for a reason. There's a dude who。
wanted my radio. It's a nice radio. He took it.。
That was the reason. That's not helpful.。
This verse says, "No, Him。
taking your radio is working。
out for your good."。
And you can believe that。
as much as you can believe anything。
in life.。
You can hold on to that truth. That's。
unbelievable. And so,。
who's good? There's two conditions。
on this statement.。
Those who love God.。
And that's。
the promise. It's for those who, it's not for。
anybody. It's for those who love God and for those who。
have been called according to His purpose.。
That God。
didn't save you。
so that you could kick up your feet and take life。
easy. He didn't save you so that。
you can sulk in your sorrows. He didn't save。
you so that you can sit in your home alone. God。
saved you for a purpose. It's why He didn't。
save you and then call you home to glory。
instantly. But He saved you and He left。
you there so that you would continue。
to work out His purpose. Continue to walk。
through the good works which He's prepared in advance。
for you to walk in.。
That He's called you to a purpose. That your life。
has purpose. And you've got to find that。
because, you know, where your city that you。
live in will tell you your purpose is this. Your work will。
tell you that your purpose is this. Your mom and dad will tell you。
that your purpose is this. And God says, "No, your purpose is this."。
And you need to know, "I would trust God over。
anybody else。
what your purpose actually。
is."。
And so this verse,。
it can come across as trite.。
I'd be cautious to stick this。
verse in front of someone who is。
suffering.。
It can feel like you're writing off their。
suffering. It can feel like you're not suffering。
with them. But I would not。
lose sight of the promise. And I would。
continue to offer this promise to。
someone who is suffering. The promise behind。
this verse that God is at work。
in their suffering. Not to be。
insensitive, but to help them.。
To remind them. To help them carry that。
burden. To sit in the suffering。
with them and wait. Tell them to wait。
so that we can see God's promise。
come to fruition.。
But I want to show you。
what this verse does if we believe it. Because it。
has unbelievable power。
behind it.。
It really unlocks a lot。
of other verses in the scripture. There's all。
of these verses in the scripture that say that。
we can have joy in suffering. Now the。
world will never tell you that you can have。
joy in suffering. That doesn't make sense to science.。
That doesn't make sense to the way that。
the world is wired. That you can experience joy。
in suffering. But Romans 8.28 unlocks。
these verses. Verses。
like Romans 5 verse 3.。
"Not only so, but we also glory。
in our sufferings because we know that。
suffering produces perseverance."。
We can glory in our suffering. James 1 verse。
2 and 3. "Consider it pure joy。
my brothers and sisters whenever you face trials."。
Who considers trials joy? James.。
Romans 8.28。
will help you do that. 1 Peter。
4 verse 13 says, "But rejoice。
in as much as you participate in the。
sufferings of Christ。
so that you may be overjoyed。
when his glory is revealed."。
Colossians 1 verse 24.。
"Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you."。
Hebrews 10 verse 34.。
"You suffered along with those。
in prison and joyfully accepted。
the confiscation of your property."。
My radio. "Because you knew。
that you yourselves had better。
and lasting possessions."。
Do you see that。
what it's saying is that your emotions,。
listen, that your emotions do not。
have to be tied to your experiences.。
Life says that your emotions have to be tied。
to your experiences. Romans 8.28 says that。
your emotions do not have to be tied to your experiences.。
Are you following me? That you can。
experience a trial。
and still。
experience joy. So let me just。
show you, okay, this is a picture of。
two knobs. Picture like oven knobs。
if you will. You see the little red arrow.。
And so you can see there that。
knob is pointed to trial。
and that knob is pointed to sadness, right?。
And so if I turn that knob, because it's connected。
by a belt, this is just an imaginary。
illustration, because it's connected to a belt。
if I turn that knob slowly, the other。
one's going to turn slowly. So that when I。
experience fun, I'm also going。
to experience joy. But when I。
experience trials, then I'm going to。
experience sadness. What Romans。
8.28 does guys is it。
takes that belt off.。
And it says that in trials。
there is a joy that believers。
can have that comes from a future。
hope that you can experience。
joy in trials because of what。
God promises you.。
Because you know something。
better is coming. That's the promise。
of this verse. That whenever。
you are in trials, you can experience。
joy because you know that God is。
working that trial out for your good.。
You know it. As a matter of fact,。
you know it. For certainty。
you know it.。
I've seen this demonstrated through the years.。
Lots of examples.。
I'll give you one. In my own。
personal life, when I。
I guess。
I was just about to get married。
to Monica. It was one month。
before our wedding.。
I was sitting at my desk at AT&T。
and my phone。
rang and it was my mom.。
She said, "Jonathan?"。
I said, "Yes." And then she said three。
words you never want to hear someone you love。
say. See I thought she was just calling to catch up.。
How's the wedding planning going? What's going on?。
How's work? But you know we were just talking。
like normal. She says, "Jonathan,。
I have cancer.。
I need。
to start chemotherapy right away."。
Now cancer was like this。
thing to me that other people had。
and people died from and no one。
close to me had ever had cancer. Now my mom。
is on the other end of this phone saying that。
she has cancer and my whole。
world has fallen apart but hers isn't.。
She says, "Don't。
worry. My hair will。
grow back before the wedding.。
And besides,。
I think wig shopping would be kind of fun."。
I'm like, "Mom, what are you?"。
I'm like angry at her. I'm like, "What are you talking about?。
You've got cancer."。
She says, "Hey, God's at work in this."。
She held fast to the。
truth of this verse.。
My dad says about her that she has more。
faith than sense.。
But she clung, she。
clung to the promises of。
God here, right? She knows。
that God has a plan in this and so。
she's showing me this,。
right? I want to be really。
careful here. I don't know where you're at. If you're。
in a trial, I'm not even talking to you right now.。
I'm talking to those of you。
who just want to look。
at the theology behind this passage. This is a theological。
statement, not a pastoral statement.。
Let me just say this.。
I think。
you can say things one。
to many that you wouldn't say one on。
one.。
It's this. In certain。
circumstances, I should say. Because。
I would be kind and compassionate and。
shepherd those people.。
Is your。
cancer the result。
of your lack of faith?。
No.。
That would be a heresy.。
But your discouragement。
might be.。
But your。
discouragement, your despair。
in your experience。
may be the result。
of a lack of faith. Now I'm not saying you can't。
experience sadness. I'm not saying。
that you can't be upset at the trial.。
I'm not saying that you can't be angry。
that the world that we live in has fallen。
because sin has come into the world. We know that。
Jesus looked at the grave of his friend Lazarus。
and he wept.。
We find hope that Jesus experienced。
and displayed those emotions.。
So we can be compassionate. We can weep。
with our friends. We can mourn with。
those who mourn and rejoice with those。
who rejoice. Suffer with those who。
suffer.。
But。
you cannot。
doubt God's goodness.。
And I would encourage you。
not to stop believing。
that God is at work in your circumstance。
for your good.。
And this is the hope that Paul held。
onto and why he had。
the power to say。
things like these light。
and momentary troubles.。
So that's kind of。
the punchline. Now how do we get there?。
That's the solution to the problem。
but we don't really know how we got。
to that solution. So what is the good。
that God is at work in? Because it's a。
very specific good. It's not a general good.。
Let me show you now from the scriptures.。
Verse 29 it says, "For those God。
foreknew." That "for" there means "because."。
Think "because." Because。
I'm telling you God is working this out。
for your good, for those who love him,。
those who have been called according to his purpose.。
"Because those God foreknew,。
he also predestined to be conformed。
to the image of his Son." Ding, ding, ding,。
ding, ding. Here's the good.。
"That he might be the firstborn。
from among many brothers and。
sisters."。
And so God has started something。
since the beginning。
that he's going to carry out in you. And so my second。
point is this. It's this good,。
the good that we're talking about in Romans。
8-28. This good is。
God's end goal for you.。
This good is something very specific。
and the very specific good thing。
that God is working out in your life。
is his end goal for you。
that you would be conformed to the image。
and the character of his Son。
Jesus Christ for all eternity.。
You're being made into something。
that you were being made into。
since the beginning of time.。
So this is not a。
"I lost my job." That's okay.。
"God has a better job for me."。
#Romans8-28。
That's not what's going on here.。
That's not what this verse teaches.。
This is a。
"I lost my job." It's okay.。
God is conforming。
me to the image of Christ through this。
circumstance and he has set up for me。
an eternal glory. And a hundred。
years from now, it won't matter。
that I lost my job. A billion。
years from now, it won't matter that I lost。
my job. I will not be in heaven。
10,000 years from now。
sulking because I lost my job.。
I know it's going to be okay because。
God has set up for me an eternal glory,。
eternal riches with him in his。
presence forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever。
and ever and ever and ever.。
And that's the hope I cling to as I sit here。
frustrated。
that this didn't。
go as I wanted, but hopeful。
and even joyful.。
And even joyful.。
And so let's define some terms.。
Those he foreknew.。
Now I want to confess to you that for a number。
of years when I came into the faith, I read。
this foreknowledge as like God knowing。
what was going to happen in the future. Maybe some of you。
thought that's what this is.。
This he foreknew, this means that God knows。
what's going to happen. That's not what this foreknew means.。
This is a he foreknew you.。
He。
before creation looked。
ahead and existed in relationship。
with you before you ever were.。
In his mind, you were his.。
He knew you like he。
knew Israel in Amos 3 verse 2.。
Like he knew Israel before。
or among all of the nations, he knew。
Israel as his in the same way。
before you were created, before your mama。
was created, before your parents ever。
lived and your grandparents ever lived and before。
he shaped the earth.。
He knew you like he knows。
you today.。
He foreknew。
you.。
See, God doesn't。
exist in a chronological timeline.。
We exist。
in Monday, porch。
day, Wednesday, Thursday,。
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.。
God。
stands outside of that chronology。
and he just sees。
the end result. He sees it like a。
painting, candidly. Not。
like a movie, but like a picture, somehow.。
I can't even get my head around that.。
It says those he。
foreknew, he also predestined. Lots of debate。
around this verse, so I really want to explain to you what it。
means, predestined.。
What this word here, predestined。
means, is it means。
predestined.。
Destined ahead。
of time, if you would rather that.。
It means。
determined beforehand.。
Don't be。
so concerned。
that God。
is in control.。
Don't be so confused or concerned。
that, "Well, wait a minute, but I can't understand that."。
Good. Do you want a fathomable God?。
I want an unfathomable God.。
I think we would all say, "No, I want an unfathomable。
God. God is unfathomable." But I hate that he's unfathomable.。
I wish he was fathomable.。
No, "But God is。
so big and sovereign and huge,。
but I wish he fit in my little box。
nice and neat, so that I could completely。
understand everything about him."。
You don't want to worship a God you understand.。
Man,。
you don't even understand women, much less。
God, right? I mean, you don't want to。
worship a God that you don't understand.。
You don't want to worship a God that。
you understand, right?。
God is God, right? He's。
all-powerful. You don't know anything. There is。
nothing else in this world。
like him. And so here's。
what I would tell you. If God is not sovereign, you are。
not secure.。
Like, if you could do。
anything to be saved, then you could。
certainly do something to lose your。
salvation. If you are in control of your。
salvation, you'll lose it. I。
can't even keep up with my keys, much less。
my salvation, right? And so I need God。
to be in complete control of that.。
His sovereignty。
is the only force in this。
universe strong enough to hold。
me secure。
in heaven, in his kingdom, with him.。
It's the God who called you。
at the beginning of time.。
That God you will not slip through。
his fingers. That's meant to give you hope.。
And so what is the goal。
that he's working towards? As I said, it's you。
being conformed to the image of his。
son. The good that he is。
working out in your life is。
you being made like Jesus, who is firstborn。
over all creation. Firstborn means that。
others are to come. His。
brothers and sisters, that's you.。
That you have been adopted into his family.。
We said the other day that the entire Bible。
is about God getting his children back,。
and I'll add to it tonight, and placing。
Jesus as head over a new tribe。
that belongs to God and was。
always going to belong to God.。
That's。
the story being written. God getting his kids。
back and putting Jesus over them。
as the head, his siblings, the。
church, your。
brothers and sisters.。
And so it raises the question,。
"JP, what if I'm not predestined?"。
I don't know.。
But, before。
you lose hope, let me just offer you something.。
Consider where you're at tonight, on a Tuesday.。
When。
your friends are having $2 margaritas。
somewhere, and maybe you。
stumbled into this place thinking it was a restaurant。
and you hoped to get a good burger, and all of a sudden you find。
yourself in church, and I just, "Hey, God's。
in that. He's。
after you."。
And so, if you're here, and you're。
Hindu, good luck.。
God's pursuing。
you. If you're here, and you're atheist,。
I just got a feeling you're not going to。
be atheist long.。
Because God is radically pursuing。
you. If you're here for all。
the wrong reasons, you want to take。
advantage of someone, you want to。
pray on God's people, watch。
out.。
He's a huge God.。
And he's going to get you, and the way that。
he's going to punish you is he's going to save you.。
And make you do his will for the。
rest of your life. I mean, that's what he does, right?。
It's amazing.。
That's how。
he punished me. Praise God.。
And so,。
you might be here,。
"Well, what if my loved one is not predestined?。
What if somebody I love very much is not predestined,。
JP, that keeps me up at night?"。
I don't know.。
But consider who's in their life.。
Consider who God。
and his sovereignty placed。
in their family tree, or next to them,。
or in a relationship with them,。
so that he might call。
them into a relationship with him. He uses。
those he's called.。
And it's beautiful.。
And so here's what this means, right?。
It means that when life。
is hard, God is working towards。
something, some end goal.。
You ever seen somebody that's like, really。
out of shape, and they're like, "Man, 2016。
is my year." And they go to the gym,。
and they get a trainer, and they go all out, they get the。
workout clothes, they go to Lululemon and spend。
like $20,000, and then they go。
to the gym, and they're just like, "I'm gonna go。
big, I'm gonna do it right," you know, and they're there,。
and they're like, "Oh, it's so hard, I don't。
wanna quit." They just constantly wanna quit, and they're out of。
shape. And I've seen these people,。
I've been in a gym before, I know where it is.。
And so I've seen these people, right?。
And it's like, I've been。
in those people, and so, and。
they're just like, "Okay, I wanna give up, I wanna give up,。
I wanna give up." But something happens as they don't。
give up, as they press through, they begin。
to feel better. And they begin to。
look better, and they begin to lose weight,。
and begin to have more energy, they begin to reap the benefits.。
And all of a sudden, they're an addict, they're a gym rat,。
"I'm not going anywhere, I'm in the gym," you know,。
and they're just, they're loving it, they can't get enough。
of the gym, because they, all of a sudden, they're like。
the icon of health.。
And you're like, "How did this happen?" It's because。
they began to see the benefit.。
And the benefit。
began to,。
it became worth the cost.。
And that's what this verse is saying,。
it's saying, "Hey, here's the benefit."。
And so,。
in the trial, know that it's worth it.。
Press forward, because something。
good is coming, something。
good is coming for you, right?。
God, through every trial, He's sculpting。
you, He's turning you to。
something, so trust this truth in。
trials, that God is。
turning you into something.。
The best way I know how to illustrate this is the story。
of Michael Angelo.。
He's a sculptor in the 1500s,。
and maybe his most famous work of all time。
is the statue of David.。
Not David Marvin, but。
David.。
And,。
he was asked。
this question,。
"How did you create such a beautiful monument?"。
And listen to his amazing response.。
He said,。
"Just chip away the stone that doesn't。
look like David. In every。
block of marble I see a statue。
as plain as though it stood before me,。
shaped and perfect in attitude。
and action. I have only to。
hew away the rough walls。
that imprison the lovely apparition。
to reveal it to the other。
eyes as mine see it."。
And in your life,。
God is taking this statue。
called you, and chipping away。
everything that does not look like Jesus,。
and it may not feel good。
as you get hit with a hammer,。
and a chisel, and a spike, and。
rocks are falling off, but。
you are being mold and shaped into the。
image of Jesus for eternity.。
And in a hundred years,。
two hundred years, two hundred。
thousand years,。
the pain won't even be a memory。
that you carry.。
You will just be perfected。
like Christ in all your glory。
for eternity,。
and it will be worth it.。
See, God doesn't always。
change your circumstance.。
His promise is to change you。
in your circumstance.。
He doesn't always change。
your circumstance. His promise is to change you。
in your circumstance, and so if it's painful,。
hold on.。
If it doesn't feel good, hold fast。
to the hope of glory.。
Verse 30,。
"And those he predestined, he also。
called, and those he called, he also。
justified. Those he justified,。
he also glorified."。
He glorified.。
The third and final point。
is that the best is yet to come.。
The best is。
yet to come. This progression。
that Paul writes here to the church in Rome,。
it's very matter of fact.。
It is meant to offer you hope。
and security that God doesn't miss anyone。
that he's accounted for in the beginning.。
No one slips through the fingers。
of God. Everyone。
is accounted for. Everyone。
that he predestined, he called,。
and he called, he justified, he justified,。
he glorified, that glorified。
there. That's his end goal. That's。
the good that he's working toward. That's you。
in the character, or in the image rather,。
of Christ. And so let's just define。
this. This word called, right, this。
is not a...。
Come here, Spot.。
Spot, come here.。
It's not that kind of called.。
It's like this. "Lazarus, come。
forth!"。
This call brings。
about the thing that it requests.。
This call,。
this word call, it brings。
into reality the very request。
that it makes. When Jesus says,。
"Lazarus, come forth," Lazarus cannot。
say no. He's。
just coming. Against his will。
he's coming. He's forth,。
out of the grave, it's done. This is。
the call here. It's not a。
"Hey, come here and you might miss it." It's not。
a phone ringing.。
It's something that your soul and your。
body and your heart has to。
obey. That sin。
no longer has power。
over you. And you walk。
from that grave forward.。
This justified, this word。
means declared righteous.。
It's a beautiful word.。
It happens in a moment that。
Jesus' righteousness is imputed。
on you. That all of the。
righteousness from his account is。
accredited to your account.。
That you in a moment are。
seen as righteous, even though you're an adulterer.。
Even though you had an abortion.。
Even though you're addicted to pornography.。
Even though you're having sex with your significant。
other. Even though you're getting drunk. Even though。
you're legalistic. Even though you're self-righteous.。
You're justified.。
You don't have to pay for that.。
You don't。
have to pay for that.。
You are no longer。
under the penalty。
of sin.。
Yeah.。
And those who justified, he also。
glorified. You know what's amazing about。
this word? It's。
past tense.。
But it hasn't happened yet.。
But it has. But it hasn't.。
But it has. God sits。
outside of time.。
He's not operating。
in your chronological order.。
He sees you as glorified.。
Perfect.。
Like Jesus.。
Pure and holy.。
Before himself.。
Forever and ever and ever.。
That one day you would be somewhere。
absent of the presence。
of sin. This is the reality。
that Jesus on the cross, you remember what he said?。
"To tell is died."。
It is finished.。
What is finished, Jesus?。
It's not finished. You haven't raised from the grave.。
What's finished? Your sin is。
paid for. God in his wrath,。
in his fullness, is satisfied。
on me. The bill is paid.。
Every image you've looked at. Everything。
you've done wrong. It's been paid。
for to tell is died.。
But it ain't over.。
The best is yet。
to come. I'm going to。
raise from the grave. This is the。
truth that we walk in. That it's finished.。
My sins are paid for.。
And the best is yet to come. This already。
and not yet.。
Sins paid for and the reward。
for those sins being paid。
for in its fullness is。
coming my way of glory.。
Praise God.。
And so we're。
free from the power of sin.。
Free from the penalty of sin.。
And one day。
much sooner than we'll ever expect, we're。
free from the presence of sin forever。
and ever and ever. This perspective。
is so powerful.。
Perspective is powerful.。
That eternity with God,。
the perfect, awaits you。
my friend. It awaits you my friend.。
You're here on a Tuesday. I know your whole life's in front。
of you. Maybe you've got 20, 30 years. Maybe 40。
years. And eternity。
in glory with the Father awaits。
you. And so you can see your cancer.。
You can see your sickness.。
Your hurt. Your breakup. You can see it。
through that lens.。
I mean as we look back, like let me。
tell you something man. In the 6th grade,。
oh man, in the 6th grade,。
I was dating Ann Marie. Let me。
just start here. No one。
should be dating anybody in the 6th grade.。
Okay?。
It's stupid. But I。
was. And。
Ann Marie, I loved her.。
I wanted to marry Ann Marie。
and she dropped。
me like a bad habit in front of everybody。
man. I mean I'm talking just like。
looked at me in front of all my friends and just。
said hey it's over. No reason, no。
excuse. I mean she liked somebody else. But I。
was there and I was, I like。
couldn't get myself together.。
I remember walking to the bathroom。
and wishing it had a lock on the door because。
I was like snot crying, like。
ugly crying in the mirror. I remember like looking。
at myself in the mirror at my。
little school and said what is wrong。
with you that Ann Marie doesn't like you anymore?。
And I'm embarrassed to tell you this part.。
But I remember,。
I remember hitting my。
head against the wall.。
Thinking that life as I knew it。
was over. And that anybody。
that would come after Ann Marie would just be。
a significant step down.。
(Laughter)。
And you laugh.。
But the。
pain to me was very real.。
Now if I was talking about a miscarriage。
my hunch。
is you wouldn't laugh.。
If I was talking about being laid。
off yesterday you might not laugh. If I was talking。
about man I just got diagnosed with cancer。
you probably wouldn't laugh.。
But can I tell you something crazy?。
The pain that I felt in the 6th grade。
was just as real to me。
than any of those things.。
And the only thing that makes it silly。
is perspective.。
Like I'm removed from it by time。
now I'm married to Monica.。
Upgrade!。
(Laughter)。
Just kidding Ann Marie you're great. Made in the image of God.。
(Laughter)。
But upgrade.。
And。
so I'm removed from that situation. I look back。
and it's silly now. We can laugh about it.。
It's funny and I'm not trying to be insensitive。
but I'm just telling you 100 years。
from now you're going to feel similar。
about your trials.。
I really am. I'm just speaking。
from a theological truth of a verse。
and I'm not trying to upset you or frustrate。
you. I'm just telling you。
that glory。
is coming.。
And you can have hope。
in the midst of that.。
And so if it seems like an ugly。
painting,。
wait for it.。
Hold on.。
Because you are watching the most amazing。
artist I know.。
He makes all things。
beautiful.。
Wait for it. You can believe that.。
Take it to the bank.。
So in summary, God's work。
God works the bad out for your good.。
God's good is his end goal for you.。
Christ's glory。
and the best is yet to come for those who love Him。
who have been called according to His purpose.。
Sunday night。
sitting on。
the bed, my little girl。
and。
Presley, the girl's。
share room.。
Presley says,。
"Daddy, I want to become a Christian."。
We've had these conversations。
before. I've。
asked her diagnostic questions before.。
I'm like, "Presley, between 1 and 10,。
how certain are you that if you die today that you go to。
heaven?" She's like, "9.。
9.5."。
Something was。
different Sunday.。
She looked at me and。
she said, "10."。
I'm like, "Okay, she might have learned。
the answer, so why?"。
She just answered so differently. She said,。
"Because..."。
She said, "Daddy, not because of anything I've done."。
She said, "But because of what Jesus。
has done for me, that He died。
for my sins and God raised。
Him from the dead."。
What a beautiful truth. I said, "Presley,。
would you like。
to pray?"。
She said, "Yeah."。
I said, "Let。
God know that。
you've done a lot of。
things, that you've sinned against Him."。
She said, "God, I've sinned against。
You. I know I've sinned。
against You." She thanked。
Him for Jesus and His payment for。
her sins.。
She thanked Him. She thanked God。
that He has the power to raise Jesus from the。
grave.。
She asked God, "Would。
You come and live in my life? Would。
You send Your Spirit。
to guide me?" It was the most beautiful,。
articulate, Gospel-centered prayer that a。
nine-year-old could pray.。
She said, "Amen."。
I said, "Presley,。
you're a Christian."。
I said, "Presley, we're going to spend。
forever and ever。
and ever together in Heaven.。
We're going to be there in God's glory, together。
forever and ever. We get to be there。
forever."。
She started crying.。
I said, "Why are you sad?"。
She said, "No, Daddy. These are happy tears.。
These are happy。
tears."。
I said, "Presley, this is what this means.。
That now。
that you've been called according to His。
purpose. That whatever。
circumstance life throws。
at you, you know that you can。
get through because God is working it。
out for your good. You're going to be with。
Him forever and ever and。
ever. So just hold on because。
much sooner than you think this world。
won't matter as much as everyone's going。
to try to convince you that it does,。
God is saying He's doing。
something bigger than it.。
In your circumstance, Presley,。
hold on. Let me tell you something.。
As a dad who loves her very much,。
I know what's coming her way.。
I know heartbreak is coming。
her way. I know that at some。
time in the future when she's 30。
that some idiot is。
going to hurt her and I'm going to。
want to hurt him. I know that's。
coming her way.。
Layoffs.。
God forbid, sickness,。
maybe cancer,。
carriages.。
She's going to face these types。
of things, maybe bigger. She's going。
to lose loved ones. She's。
going to lose her parents. She's going to put her。
daddy in the grave one day.。
And let me tell you something.。
This daddy can't fix those。
things.。
I can't make them good.。
But that daddy can.。
And that daddy will.。
He promised.。
He promised。
that he would.。
How incredible is that?。
And friends, what I'm telling you is。
he made you the exact same promise.。
And so when you wake up。
tomorrow and you're。
looking at an ugly painting,。
friends, you hold on.。
God ain't done yet.。
The best is yet to come.。
And he's。
going to turn it around. He's going to turn it for your。
good. That's what he does.。
He's always done that.。
There was a painting one day of an ugly。
dead。
man on a cross.。
And the enemy。
was doing the happy dance.。
He thought it was over.。
And God。
flipped the script.。
And he made it。
an empty tomb.。
He made a salvation for all who。
believe.。
He's really good at that.。
He's really,。
really good at that. Let me praise him.。
Let me thank him now.。
Father, you make。
everything beautiful.。
Thank you。
for the hope。
that you've given us in this。
passage, for the。
truth that you've placed。
in here for us to cling to, to hold。
on to,。
for the realities of Romans。
828,。
the truths of Romans。
829, and the promise of Romans。
830,。
that we will be in glory。
with you forever and ever and。
ever and ever and ever and ever.。
Oh, God.。
You're。
a great dad.。
And I know。
that we're going to be tempted to lose。
sight of this very soon. And so,。
would you and your sovereignty, by the power。
of your spirit at work in our lives, would you just。
remind us, please?。
And would you help us to。
believe it? Would you help。
us to live it?。
I know that some of you are here。
tonight, and。
that promise is not for you,。
at least not yet.。
You。
don't love God. You haven't yet。
been called according to His purpose。
in the chronological timeline。
that we live in.。
And I'm。
confident,。
if I may say, that。
He's calling you.。
And I hope that。
you would consider giving。
your life to Him, that you would be。
a new creation, that you would change。
the way that you live, really,。
that He would come in your life and begin to change。
the way that you live, making。
you, chipping away。
in your life that which does not look。
like Jesus. And you know if that's you.。
You know if that's where you're at. There's going to be。
a team of folks up here that would love。
to talk to you. And if you're here and you're。
asking the question, "Well, how do I know? How can I。
trust God? How do I know that He's going。
to make it good?" He's。
showed us.。
He's shown us that the。
worst day in history。
we would call Good。
Friday.。
Because He paid for our sins there.。
Because He set us free there。
2,000 years。
ago. Set us。
free.。
And so we would love to talk with you about that。
if that's where you're at. We would love。
to wrestle with you. This is。
a great, safe place。
for you to ask any questions that you have.。
And if you're sitting in your。
life staring at an ugly。
painting, hold on.。
Wait for it.。
The best is yet to come.。
It ain't over yet.。
