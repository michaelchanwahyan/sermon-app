>> All right, Porsche, how we doing?。
We doing okay?。
[APPLAUSE]。
Great to see you.。
Welcome, it's so good to have you here in the room.。
We do not take it for granted that you would give us your。
time here this evening.。
Not just those of you that are here, though, it's wonderful。
to see you.。
Thanks so much for making time to join us, but also all of。
you that are tuning in online right now, particularly all。
of our Porsche Live locations.。
I want to give a special shout out to Porsche Live Wheaton,。
Fort Worth, and Dayton.。
It is a joy to get to be a part of what God is doing amongst。
a generation of young adults, not just in Dallas, not just。
in America, but really all over the globe.。
We're going to talk a little bit more about that, which is。
why we have been particularly in this series.。
But I just want to set things up for us tonight by leading。
off with a story.。
You see, last week when I was beginning to plan this message,。
it did not occur to me until that time that it's almost。
exactly 10 years from the date that some of my very best。
friends and I planned what was going to be the trip of a。
lifetime. You see, at that time, I had just graduated college,。
was working in the young adult world, and my buddies were。
still finishing up all their master's degree at Texas A&M.。
And we thought, man, we've got to round this thing out in。
style. Like it has been an amazing four or five years, all。
of us together, and we have got to close this chapter of。
life in the biggest, best possible way.。
And so what we decided to do is we decided to take what。
was going to be the college cruise of the century.。
You see, everybody that we knew and everybody that we would。
want to know was going to be on this specific boat. People。
from different universities all around the nation descending。
onto this ship for a five-day Caribbean island-hopping。
adventure. It was going to be awesome. That is until I visited。
with my then-girlfriend, now wife, Brooke, and I learned。
that we also happened to have her sister's wedding that。
exact same week. Yes. All of my excitement was instantaneously。
replaced with regret. You see, the reason why is I had made。
a massive mistake. I had already given her my word that I。
was going to go to the wedding with her. You see, this was。
the woman that I intended to spend the rest of my life with.。
These were her family members and thus my future in-laws,。
and I needed to make every effort to be there, but I had。
already put money down on this trip. And so I found myself。
double-booked, and not the kind of double-booked where it's。
like, you know what, I've got two lunch appointments and。
I've got to find a way to make one off and make one work.。
No, I was double-booked between two of what were likely。
to be the most important, two of the more important events。
that would ever take place in my life. These were my best。
friends, the guys that stood with me in my wedding. Like。
this was our final hoorah. I had already paid the money.。
And yet this was my future wife. So what did I do?。
I ate the ticket.。
I went to that wedding.。
And I have learned the dangers of double-booking ever since.。
Now, let me ask you, do you think that was an easy decision。
for me to make? No, of course it wasn't. These are my best。
guys. This was the trip of a lifetime. And yet what I knew。
in this moment is that though it was not an easy decision。
to make, it was an easy decision to stand by. I knew what。
was right. And although I hated to miss this trip, I knew。
I would always regret taking it if I went. Because Brooke。
mattered more. Why do I tell you all this?。
Thank you for that.。
That's the kind of crowd reaction I need whenever I tell。
stories that self-deprecate and exalt her. You see, in this。
life, you will find yourself similarly double-booked, in。
compromising positions of panic, torn between two loves,。
that which you want now and that which you want most. And。
it will be the result of some mistake you made, some error。
that you caused, some decision that went wrong. And what。
you do in that moment has the power to either fill you。
with relief or flood you with regret.。
You see, in that moment, you have to make a decision.。
What is the decision? You need to make the decision to。
repent. What the Bible talks about as a changing of mind。
that leads to a changing of life, like you don't stay the。
course, keep your plans, jump on the boat, and go on that。
spring break adventure. You instead decide to bite the。
bullet, eat the cost, take ownership of the mistake, and。
change your ways because God matters most. You return to。
the one you love. How do you do this?。
Well, that's what I want to talk with you about tonight.。
So if you have a Bible with you, you can open it to 2。
Corinthians chapter 7. If you don't have a copy of the。
scriptures, do not fear. We'll have them on the screen。
behind me. But we've been in a series called Revive. And。
over the course of the series, we've been unpacking these。
different principles of personal renewal. And the reason。
why we've been doing it is it undeniable that there is a。
surge of spirituality sweeping not just across our nation,。
but across the globe. I will not bore you with the data.。
You can go back and listen to other talks, but the。
statistics are staggering. Like what we see is that where。
Christianity was previously in a cycle of terminal decline,。
it is within the last year or so, reversed. Like we see。
young adults, young men, young women leading the charge。
as people are coming back to Christ and joining into。
his body in ways that we have not seen in so long and。
we dared feared we would never see again. And yet here's。
our conviction as we see God moving all across the world.。
I unapologetically want to see him move here. I desperately。
want to see God work in this room. You see, I want you。
to believe, God, I want you to believe this, that Jesus。
Christ lived and died and rose forth from the grave to。
give you a scope and scale of life that transcends what。
so many of you have settled for. He has come to give。
you something bigger and better and grander and greater。
than what you have likely allowed yourself. And so the。
way we get there is not by praying to God for widespread。
revival, though we should do that. It is first and foremost。
by praying to God that he would bring about inner renewal.。
You see, it has been our conviction from this stage。
in this series that you do not find revival by seeking。
revival. You find revival by seeking renewal. Widespread。
revival, it begins with inner renewal. What do I mean。
when I talk to you about this idea of inner renewal?。
What I'm talking about is a recalibration of your inner。
man or your inner woman around the person of Jesus. And。
what is so fascinating and not coincidental in the。
slightest is that as we started preaching this idea。
just weeks ago, the Bible Society released an article。
that quoted and coined the phrase "over the current。
outpouring of God's Spirit in our world as a quiet。
revival." You see, this revival movement that we're。
seeing not just in the United States, but in England。
and in Wales and in Finland and in Australia and in。
other parts of the world, what we're seeing is we're。
actually realizing that it is marked by subtlety and。
sincerity. There is a simplicity to it where so many。
people expected a lavish movement of the Spirit or。
they anticipated instead that there would be this。
widespread outpouring that would call people to。
their knees. Instead, it is not as widespread as it。
is individualized. God is working in the private。
places of hearts like yours, more so than in the。
public places of arenas and coliseums and spectacles。
alike. I want renewal for you because I believe it's。
through your renewal and your renewal and your。
renewal and your renewal and your renewal, who's。
not looking at me, and your renewal that God will。
generate revival. And let me just say, as I've said。
from the stage, I don't need us to be the apex of。
awakening history. I just want to be a part of。
awakening history. I want there to be a movement。
of God that transcends my ability in communicating,。
our ability in singing, our leader's ability in。
hosting. I want there to be something so inexplicable。
about your time here at the porch that it's not the。
porch's name you remember. It is the name of Jesus。
Christ that you remember, that his presence would。
be in this room and you would sense that, sense it.。
Like it would actually be mediated by your senses.。
It wouldn't just be something you know. It。
wouldn't just be something you feel. It would be。
something you experience. And so what we've talked。
about, the first principle of renewal was that you。
had to break up the fallow ground. You had to。
break up your hard-heartedness. The second one。
that we talked about is you had to cultivate hunger,。
a longing, a yearning, a desire for more of God.。
And here what we're to talk about tonight is this。
third principle of renewal, which is you must。
radically repent. And the reason we're getting。
into it is because I think so many of us believe。
we know how to repent, but we do a terrible job。
of it. And therein lies the issue. We do not know。
how to repent. And so I want to talk to you about。
how we do that together. And we see it in 2 Corinthians。
7. I think 2 Corinthians 7 is a perfect passage。
to talk about this idea of repentance because I。
am not sure that there is a passage of Scripture。
that better unpacks the nature of repentance.。
Yes, you see repentance all over the Scripture.。
You see it in Psalm 32. You see it in Psalm 51. You。
can pick any other passage and you can teach this。
idea. But what we really see here is the essence。
of what should be true for those that want to。
rightly repent. Now before we read it, we're seven。
chapters into this letter. And what we're going。
to find is that this is actually not a discourse.。
It's a narrative. Paul is telling a story of sorts.。
And so we need to catch up to what's happening。
in the story. We need to know that things were。
going badly amongst the Christians in Corinth.。
And after having failed once through a previous。
visit to get them back on spiritual track, Paul。
sends his friend Titus with a strong letter of。
rebuke to try to spiritually recalibrate them.。
Paul's unsure of how it's going to go. But then。
Titus returns and he gives a positive report of。
his time with the Corinthians. He even tells Paul。
that his letter worked. So it's to that letter。
that Paul is going to reference as we read。
together. 2 Corinthians 7, starting in verse 8.。
He says this, "For even if I made you grieve with。
my letter," that letter we just spoke about, "I。
don't regret it, though I did regret it. For I。
see that the letter grieved you, though only for。
a while. As it is, I rejoice not because you。
were grieved, but because you were grieved into。
repenting. For you felt a godly grief, so that you。
suffered no loss through us." So what was Paul's。
letter about specifically? Well, we don't know.。
Scholars are actually torn on the issue. They。
debate. Perhaps Paul wrote a letter that was。
addressing a wrongdoer within the Corinthians。
midst that was slandering his reputation and。
leading them to disbelieve and ultimately。
disconnect from relationship to him. Others。
think that it might have been a reference to。
his first letter to the Corinthians. We're not。
sure, but what we do know is that this letter。
had its--it achieved its intended effect. It。
ultimately accomplished its goal in that it。
looked to the Corinthians, it exposed them of。
their sin, and then it caused them sorrow. It。
led them into grief, as Paul describes it, which。
is important for our purposes as we consider。
repentance in our own lives, as we journey in。
individual renewal. We have to know that real。
repentance begins with feelings of sadness.。
Real repentance begins with feelings of sadness.。
Now, to be clear, Paul does not delight in。
calling them out. Like, he's not a keyboard。
warrior that gets a rise off of ripping people。
into comments. Like, that's not his thing. He。
doesn't just stroke together a letter the。
likes of which will leave them shuddering as。
they try to go to sleep. That's not who Paul。
is. That's not his heart. He is not an Enneagram。
8 trying to challenge anyone that might come。
across his midst. No, Paul, he says that he。
regretted the pain he caused them. And another。
part, he says that he is filled with tears at。
the thought of them. He does not want to cause。
them pain, and yet he learns that they were。
grieved into repenting, and he says, "Man, this。
was worthwhile." You see, according to Paul, the。
prize of repentance is worth the high price of。
tough love. What's tough love? It's that idea。
of telling something to someone that they do。
not want to hear, though they need to hear it。
because it is the most loving thing for you to。
say to them. This is exactly what Paul has just。
done in this moment. Why has he done it? Because。
he wants to call them to repentance, and it was。
achieved. Now, why is repentance something worth。
rejoicing in? Well, we need to understand what。
repentance actually is. You see, the Greek word。
for repentance is the word metanoia. We could。
get into the architecture of how that word is。
actually put together, but really what you need。
to know is very simply that word means to change。
one's mind. You see, it is always applied within。
the scriptures in the context of someone's sin.。
Now, whenever we're in Christian circles, if you。
grew up in the church, and the idea of repentance。
was ever brought to the table, what you probably。
thought is it's a change in action. Like, "Hey,。
you got to stop doing that. You better stop doing。
that. Are you going to stop doing that? It's time。
to stop doing that." That would kind of be the。
approach to repentance. It's a change in action,。
and yet here's what I would say. That is not。
wrong, but that is the wrong place to begin. What。
we have to understand is that repentance is not。
just a change in action. According to Paul, it。
is a change in persuasion. It's an emotional。
shift that leads to a behavioral shift. That's。
how he's unpacking it here, which makes sense.。
You throw a punch because you're angry. You。
laugh because you're happy. You repent because。
you're sad over your sin. It's a natural cause。
and effect. There is an emotional reaction that。
leads to a behavioral reaction, and yet too often。
we're really bad at this. Like, we choose to。
specialize in one or the other. We specialize in。
emotion, or we specialize in action. You see,。
some of us, we're all emotion, and we're no。
action when it comes to our repentance, and so。
what we feel is we feel a guilty conscience. We。
feel bad about the sin we've done, but we do。
nothing about it. This is the guy, not looking。
at any of you, that shows up to group and says,。
"I slipped up again," but never actually takes。
matters into his own hands and does something。
about it. This is the girl that confesses to。
gossip and slander, speaking down at someone。
else's expense to make themselves feel better,。
but never actually changing the words they say。
following that moment. All emotion, no action.。
The Scriptures decry this kind of behavior.。
James 1:22 would say, "But be doers of the。
Word, not hearers only deceiving yourselves."。
Luke 6:45, from Jesus, he would say, "Why do。
you call me Lord, Lord, yet not do what I tell。
you?" But there's a second group that's all。
action with no emotion. This would be the idea。
of mindless compliance. It's doing all the。
right things, but with all the wrong heart.。
It's legalism. It's legalism, and Jesus has。
just as much of an issue with this, for he。
says in Matthew 15, 8, "This people, they honor。
me with their lips, but their heart is far。
from me." David says in Psalm 51, 16, 17, "For。
you will not delight in sacrifice, O God, or。
I would give it to you. You will not be pleased。
with a burnt offering." The sacrifices of God,。
listen, they are a broken spirit, a broken and。
a contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.。
You hear what this is all saying? You see,。
repentance, it is felt inwardly, but it is seen。
outwardly. It is both. It must impact your heart,。
but then it impacts your life. You see, the。
strength of your emotions, it directly correlates。
to the strength of your actions. So let me give。
you just an example, and a different kind of。
emotional example. When I was in college, one。
of my very best friends started dating this。
girl, and we knew that he really liked this。
girl because he decided on their very first。
date to take her to the most expensive restaurant。
in town. I do not recommend this, fellas. Don't。
set the bar so high. Otherwise, there's nowhere。
else to climb. He did this for himself. He put。
the bar as high as humanly possible. He really。
liked her, and the reason we knew this is he was。
really willing to take her to this restaurant.。
You see, the strength of his emotion correlated。
with the strength of his action. In the same way,。
the strength of your sorrow directly impacts。
the strength of your repentance. The strength。
of your sorrow directly impacts your repentance.。
Some of you, you may be asking yourself, "But。
Kylan, I don't feel sorry over my sin." I did.。
At some point in the past, I was heartbroken。
over it, guilt-ridden about it, stricken to my。
core, and yet I don't hurt any longer over it.。
Are you telling me then my repentance isn't。
real? No. The level of your emotion is not the。
barometer of your spiritual status before God,。
but the scriptures are clear. Your level of。
emotion says something about the seriousness。
with which you deal with your sin. If you do。
not feel something, the enemy is not knocking。
at your door. He is already sitting at your。
table, and you are more entangled than you might。
realize. So what do we do? Well, we keep going。
with Paul because as he walks on, what he tells。
us in verse 10 is that godly grief produces。
repentance, and that repentance leads to salvation。
without regret, whereas worldly grief produces。
death. You see, the other side of your grief。
is repentance. So you don't lean away from it.。
You lean into it. It was interesting. In a recent。
study by the American Psychological Association,。
researchers asked participants to name their。
single biggest regret in life, and the findings。
were fascinating to the researchers. They expected。
most responses to regrets to be around things。
that people should have done, and yet what they。
found is that most people's regrets were not。
around things that they should have done. Their。
regrets were around things they could have done.。
So instead of, "I really should take that nine。
to five job," people regretted instead, "I could。
have lived my life working for something that。
I loved." Do you see the difference? One is all。
about, "I should do responsibility." The other is,。
"I could pursue the possibilities." To summarize。
it more simply, most people wish that someone。
would have stopped them from pursuing what they。
should be doing with their life and wish someone。
instead would have pushed them towards what they。
could have been doing with their life. Are you。
tracking with this? I feel like this is the。
heartbeat of young adults, that we desperately。
want to be connected to something great, to。
something purposeful. This is the good news of。
repentance. It leads you into this kind of life.。
Like, it's not just saving you from the kind of。
life you should be living. No, it is actually。
releasing you into the kind of life you could。
be living. Like, that's what Paul says. He says,。
"For godly grief produces a repentance that leads。
to," what? "To salvation." Now listen, he's speaking。
to a group of believers in this moment, so he's。
not talking about that movement from death to。
life, though that is available through a godly。
grief over your sin. What he's talking about is。
he's saying, "Hey, the resurrected life is。
available to you right now, and your godly grief。
that leads to repentance, it makes that kind of。
life available." The kind of life where you walk。
with God. We just say that and we think it's so。
normal. That's not normal! Walking with God is。
amazing! How crazy is that idea? The one who。
spun the cosmos into existence, who threw the。
stars across the sky, who littered the world with。
all its creatures, that same God will walk with。
you. He's available. He's not just available, he。
is actually inviting you in. That's the kind of。
life that is available, and godly grief leads to。
it. If you would repent, this is what's on the。
table for you, the life you could be living. And。
yet, there is a catch. Isn't there always with。
Christianity? The catch is this life is only。
available through godly grief. So you're telling。
me that my sorrow isn't enough? That if I feel。
bad about the things I do that are wrong, all the。
immorality that I know is true of me, if I just。
feel bad about that, that's not enough? "Kylen, I。
thought that you just said the beginning of。
repentance is sadness." Yes, but it's a particular。
kind of sadness, and that sadness is godly grief.。
You see, you must know as we continue this concept。
of repentance that there is a difference between。
godly grief and worldly grief. Your second point.。
You have to know the difference between these。
two things. You see, the opposite of godly remorse。
for sin is not remorselessness, that you're a。
stone-cold killer, that you're emotionally。
sterile, that you never feel anything ever at any。
point towards anyone. That is not the opposite。
of godly remorse. It's not remorselessness,。
it's worldly remorse. Do you see it? It's not。
apathy. It actually disguises itself to look and。
feel the same. So how then do we know the。
difference between them? Well, here's what you。
have to know. Godly grief is sad over the sin it。
has done. Worldly grief is sad over being caught。
for the sin it has done. That is the difference。
in the two. One grieves because its sin grieves。
the heart of God. The other grieves because。
its sin has now grieved my heart in some way.。
Godly grief is a grief that looks like God's.。
It breaks his heart, it breaks his heart,。
thus it breaks yours. It's on his mind, thus。
it's on yours. If he feels a certain way, then。
you do too. But worldly grief is different.。
So let me just tell you three ways that worldly。
grief can show up in your life. That way you。
can diagnose right here, right now. You can。
assess when it comes to the things that you。
feel bad about. If it's godly or worldly grief。
that you were actually succumbing to. The first。
way that worldly grief presents itself is it。
presents itself as regret over the circumstantial。
consequences of your sin rather than the。
spiritual consequences of your sin. Regret over。
the circumstantial consequences。
rather than the spiritual consequences. This is。
the classic political or professional athlete。
apology you see when they did something wrong。
that they don't actually feel bad about and yet。
they are held accountable to saying something.。
You see, they don't actually feel grief over。
what they did. They feel grief over what that。
is now doing to them. Do you see the difference?。
You see, they hate the fact that I guess my。
reputation is now tarnished. I guess my approval。
ratings have taken a dip. I guess I have to pay。
that fine at this point. Their grief is over the。
consequence of sin. It's not over the sin itself.。
That's the first way. The second way is it's。
regret from something you did that you can never。
come from, recover from. This is the big bad.。
This is the skeleton that you have locked up in。
your closet that you hope no one will ever see.。
This is that thing that you have committed to。
taking to your deathbed, which maybe sounds a。
little bit dramatic, yet I know it's true for。
some of you. There are sins in your life that。
you look at and you say, if people knew about。
this, if they actually were aware, they would。
not think the same of me. They would never invite。
me around. My reputation would be utterly ruined.。
I would never be looked at the same way. And so。
what you do is you think, because I can never。
recover from this, I must then never truly。
repent of it. Here's the thing. You regret it。
deeply, but if Satan can't keep you from regretting。
your sin, then he will keep you from enjoying。
God's forgiveness. He will keep you locked up。
with that sin, that big bad, that thing that。
you could never let see the light of day, because。
then you're powerless against him. The third。
way is it's regret for some sin that will。
inevitably happen again. Sure, you hate that you。
do this, and yet you silently resign to the。
fact that it's going to happen again. I'm an。
angry guy. I want to be better, but I can't help。
that. I'm just angry. I'm defensive when conflict。
arises. That's just my natural propensity. I'm。
an escalator. I want to get better at that, but。
man, it's always going to be a part of who I。
am. Or man, you know, I don't want to lust, and。
yet it's hard for me to ever think about a。
world in which I won't just have eyes for my。
wife. I'm always going to have eyes for other。
women. Or it's that idea that, man, I'm always。
going to go stress shopping, because that's the。
way that I deal with the chaos in my world. Or。
I'm just going to have another drink, because I。
only know how to unwind in a world where I'm。
having a drink. Or I'm just going to have another。
drink, because that's the only kind of world。
where I can actually have fun. You see, you。
don't actually believe you can repent, that。
things can change. And yet this should be good。
news to you, because it is a declaration from。
God that they can. That maybe you feel locked。
up in this thing, but you don't have to remain。
locked up therein, for Christ has entered into。
your cell, and he has broken open the gate, and。
he has walked out innocent himself, that you。
might walk out innocent as well. This is the。
invitation. You see, worldly grief doesn't。
grieve over the effect that sin has on God. It。
grieves over the effect that sin has on you.。
That was John the Baptist's beef with the。
religious leaders in Matthew 3. He said this,。
"But when he saw that many of the Pharisees and。
Sadducees were coming to him in baptism, he。
said to them, 'You brood of vipers! Who warned。
you to flee from the wrath to come, barefruit。
in keeping with repentance?'" These guys,。
they were just doing the right things when。
people were watching. They were not doing the。
right things regardless of who was watching.。
Yet godly repentance always does right, no。
matter who it is that's looking on. So how do。
you know which grief you feel whenever you're。
caught in gossip, are defensive in conflict,。
scroll through reels and stop to look when。
you know you shouldn't, hurt someone's。
reputation just because you're jealous of。
them, take credit when it wasn't yours to take。
on the workplace, make a joke at someone。
else's expense? How do you know what sort of。
sorrow fills you? You know by way of what。
direction it leads you. You know by way of。
what direction it leads you. For a worldly。
grief, it sheds a tear, but it presses on the。
direction it was going, while godly grief。
sheds a tear and it turns back and it returns。
to the home from which it was sent. Which is。
where Paul ends. He says in 11 through 13,。
"For see what earnestness this godly grief。
has produced in you, but also what eagerness。
to clear yourself, what indignation, what。
fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment.。
At every point you have proved yourself。
innocent of the matter. So although I wrote。
to you, it was not for the sake of the one。
who did the wrong, nor for the sake of the。
one who suffered the wrong, but in order。
that your earnestness for us might be。
revealed to you in the sight of God.。
Therefore, we're comforted." You see, the。
third thing that you have to learn about。
repentance tonight, if you want to feel。
this at a personal, renewed level, is you。
have to know that there is no repentance。
without radical removal of sin. There's no。
repentance without a radical removal of。
sin. We see this is true of the Corinthians。
response as Paul details their reaction.。
He gives you seven signs of their repentance.。
We'll walk through those in just a moment,。
but he unpacks all of that just to give。
color to how radically they repented from。
their wrongs. Like, they acknowledged their。
errors, and what they decided was to wage。
war on that which was waging war on them.。
John Owen is the one who famously said,。
"You should kill sin or sin will be killing。
you." They made their mind up, "We're going。
to kill sin. Are you going to make your。
mind up and kill sin too? Otherwise, it。
will wage war against you. There is no。
neutral territory on this issue. Sin does。
not leave you as you are. It is always。
plotting. It is always scheming. It is。
always wanting to pull you down and suck。
you away from the kind of life that God。
has come to give. You want to live into。
the kind of life that Jesus has come to。
offer you? Then you have to wage war on。
that which is waging war against you.。
It's kind of similar to how my wife。
responds whenever she finds a bug in our。
house. God forbid a mosquito buzzes around。
or a June bug sweeps in or a spider。
scurries across the floor. It is like。
DEFCON 5 in our home. It's not just,。
"Take that out!" It's, "We have to batten。
down the hatches. We have to clean all。
of the baseboards. We have to caulk all。
of the windows. We have to make sure that。
we decontaminate every square inch of。
our house. Get out in the yard and spray。
bug repellent everywhere you can." You。
see, in her eyes, when there is one。
intruder that should not be where he is,。
she goes to battle. I do too by proxy in。
my relationship with her. You must do the。
same. You must go to battle. There is an。
intruder in your midst. There is something。
in your life that does not belong there.。
Yet so many of us are like, "Hey, good to。
see you. How are you doing? Make yourself。
at home." That's crazy! Why would you do。
that? Like, you might have neutral intent。
towards that thing. It might feel good。
when you hang out with it. But it is。
plotting your destruction! It wants to。
make an end of you. It wants to suck the。
life out of you, wrap its hands around。
your neck, and choke you of the breath。
that God has come to give. You must。
smother it. You must eradicate it. You。
must annihilate it. You must do everything。
in your power to get rid of it. And the。
way you know if you are is there will be。
seven signs that it's actually happening.。
That's what Paul unpacks, and so I'll。
unpack these with you very quickly. The。
first sign that he gives is that there。
should be an earnestness to your。
repentance. An earnestness. The Greek。
here is the word "spude" which literally。
it means to move quickly. It's where the。
word "spido" comes from, which is why。
people wear spidos. They need to move。
quickly through the water. You should。
move quickly in combat against your。
sin. You see, earnestness is important to。
repentance because it deals with sin。
immediately, not indifferently. Do you。
hear that? It deals with sin immediately,。
not indifferently. And I hope you hear。
me on this. The best thing some of you。
could do here tonight is respond。
earnestly to that sin that you have。
treated so indifferently tonight. That。
you wouldn't think about doing it when。
you get home. You wouldn't think about。
taking care of it tomorrow. But you would。
sit in your seat. You would stay in this。
room. You would talk with one of the。
leaders. It's gonna be down to my right。
and down to my left at the end of our。
time. And you would process it strongly.。
You would pray until you start praying。
because you're earnest to see an end to。
it. You must move immediately. You see,。
repentance is a turning away from sin,。
but earnestness is staying turned away。
from sin. Some of you need to deal。
earnestly tonight. And it's the best。
thing you could do. The best thing you。
could do for yourself. The best thing you。
could do for your spouse. The best thing。
you could do for your children. The best。
thing you could do for the generations。
to come. The best thing you could do for。
those whom your life will touch that you。
both know and you do not know. It's。
bigger than you. This is bigger than you.。
Deal earnestly. The second is an。
eagerness to clear yourself. The Greek。
word apologia, which is where we get the。
idea of apologetics. It means to present。
a reasonable defense. You see, the idea。
here is that we would live our lives in。
such a way that it would be unreasonable。
for anyone to think that sin is still。
true of us. Peter talks about it like。
this. He says, "Beloved, I urge you as。
sojourners in exiles to abstain from。
the passions of the flesh, which wage war。
against your soul. Keep your conduct。
among the Gentiles honorable, so that。
when they speak against you as。
evildoers, they may see your good deeds。
and glorify God on the day of his。
visitation." Whenever I worked in college。
ministry prior to moving into young。
adult ministry, we had a rule amongst。
the leaders of our ministry that they。
should live a lifestyle that was above。
reproach. What that meant is, "Hey, you。
don't stay over at her house or his。
house past the point that would be。
confusing to their neighbors." Get out。
of there, man. Nothing good happens。
sitting in the driveway with her. Tell。
her goodnight and see her tomorrow. We。
would tell them, "Don't wear our shirts。
or put on Christian memorabilia and go。
to the bar. It's confusing for people。
that don't know Jesus. You should present。
a reasonable defense." We would tell them,。
like, "Hey, you keep short accounts. Don't。
let any root of bitterness take hold.。
Like, make sure that, yes, conflict is。
going to come, but address it peaceably.。
Don't do so in a way where we're sitting。
on opposite ends of the table, getting。
after each other, but instead move to。
the same side of the table and reasonably。
process the issue." Because it's not with。
them or in you. It's this over here that。
we have done towards one another. You。
should behave in a way that upholds the。
gospel without confusion, Christian. You。
should present a reasonable defense,。
eager to clear yourself. The third is。
indignation. This is the idea of anger or。
displeasure. Some of you, whenever it。
comes to your sin, you're just, "I'm。
frustrated, man. My God, this thing sucks.。
I hate this so much." That's good. You。
should not be upset that that's the case.。
It's good that you feel indignation, that。
there's a righteous anger towards that。
which is unrighteous within you. But。
here's the thing. Don't mistake beating。
yourself up for beating back your sin.。
Beat back your sin. Deal with your。
behavior. But don't get cross and think。
that you're the problem. It is the sin。
within you that is the issue. You must。
deal with it for Christ has come to deal。
with it himself. The fourth is fear. This。
is the word phobos. It's rooted in a word。
that means to flee or to withdraw from。
something. This is what you feel whenever。
you're watching a movie and there's kind。
of a jump scene, right? What's your。
reaction whenever a jump scene happens。
in the film? You jump and you try to。
get away. Like you try to scurry out of。
the proximity of whatever is happening。
in that moment. That's what this is. Your。
instinct to flee or to separate yourself。
from whatever's attacking you, which in。
this case is sin. Like you need to know。
the application here is that you must。
separate yourself from sin. You have to。
stop entertaining it. You have to push。
it as far away as possible. You must。
treat it as something that is fearful.。
The next is longing. This word means。
desire or yearning. Like all of life is。
either a drawing near or a drifting away。
from Jesus. Every decision you make, the。
thoughts you think, the words you speak,。
the places you go, the music you listen。
to, everything's gonna either lead you。
near to him or lead you far from him. To。
be very clear, I'm not saying that if you。
are in Christ, anything can separate you。
from the love of God, but this will。
impact your proximity to his presence,。
your enjoyment of his goodness. And so。
you should, in light of longing, desire。
for more of him. Do whatever it can. Do。
whatever you can to stay as close to him。
as possible. I don't know what that is。
for you. Perhaps the best thing you can。
do, come tomorrow in your quiet time, I'm。
making it easy for you, I'll give you。
the agenda right here, is write down what。
stirs your affections for God. What is。
it? Worship music. Maybe, but perhaps it's。
hanging with friends, sitting by the。
fire, going for a walk, sitting by the。
lakeside, casting a rod and reel. I don't。
know what it is, but you have to work it。
out because those things, they deepen。
your longing for God. The next is zeal.。
The Greek here is rooted, I love this, in。
this word, zeal, which means to boil. Like。
your repentance shouldn't just be warm。
it should be scalding. Like this is a。
willingness to do whatever it takes。
to honor God with your life. Like when。
Jesus spoke about cutting off the arm or。
plucking off the eye, if ever it caused you。
to sin, this is the essence of what he was。
getting at. You see, too often we ask。
ourselves when it comes to matters of。
repentance, how far do I actually need to。
go? In Jesus's mind, he's asking a。
different question. How far are you。
willing to go? There's a big difference。
there. Too often we fear going too far。
that we never go far enough when it。
comes to our sin. Now what does it look。
like for you to actually not take your。
phone to bed, but to leave it in the。
other room? I had a roommate in college,。
lust was his thing, and so we ripped the。
door off of the tinges so he had no。
privacy. You're laughing, but we were。
zealous. We wanted the death of this in。
his life. We would hit our knees。
regularly and pray to God for victory.。
Some of you, you need to be willing to。
hand over your social media account。
info so people can go in and can check。
your algorithm and look at your explore。
page and actually track what you've been。
searching, look at your YouTube watch。
history, whatever it is. Yeah, some of you。
are like, "Oh my God, that'd be really。
nerve-wracking," because you know you。
need it. Hand over your transaction。
history. Maybe you shouldn't be spending。
money the way you're spending money. I。
don't know what it is, but get crazy。
about it. It's worth getting crazy over.。
It's worth being zealous for. You need to。
be willing to be more, and you see, you。
have to be willing to go as far as it。
takes, but Kylan, I'm already confessing.。
Listen, so many of you, you're too busy。
confessing and you're not busy enough。
repenting. Like your accountability。
groups, they're just confession groups.。
You just show up and you just confess。
your sins. I know because I was in one.。
You know what changed the game?。
I started giving people permission in my。
groups to hold me actually accountable.。
What did that look like? They could。
ground me. Kylan, we're gonna put a。
curfew on you. Hey, we're gonna take your。
phone from you. Hey, we're actually gonna。
look at what it is you're looking at.。
They put parameters on my life. They。
treated me like a child because I was。
behaving like a child. This is the。
greatest thing you could give yourself.。
Dignify your community to hold you。
accountable in the ways that you。
actually need. And the last is punishment.。
We won't talk about that because that's。
awkward. No, punishment is an odd。
interpretation here. What he's actually。
saying is vindication or justice.。
Like in the life of a believer, repentance。
should propel you to a place where。
you're not just seeking God's forgiveness,。
but you're seeking forgiveness from。
those whom you've wronged. That you。
would pick up the phone and you would。
call that person that you spoke ill of.。
That you would actually sit down over。
coffee and you would confess your。
jealousy of someone. That you would。
actually be willing to sit with someone。
or write them a letter or type them an。
email, whatever it is, to simply reconcile。
the relationship. It's willing to take。
matters of justice into your own hands,。
repair the damages that you've made.。
These seven signs, they give you a。
picture of what should be true in your。
repentance. If you are looking for a。
litmus test as to the quality of your。
faith, listen to me Christian. If you're。
looking for a litmus test as to the。
quality of your faith, then look to the。
quality of your repentance. It will tell。
you, I'm convinced true Christian。
maturity is not seeing less of your sin,。
it is seeing more of it. It is knowing。
that I need more of God. I'm far more。
helpless than I dared thought, but He is。
so much more gracious than I ever。
thought to believe. D.L. Moody said, "Man。
is born with his back toward God. When。
he truly repents, he turns right around。
and he faces God." Repentance is a change。
of mind. Repentance is the tear in the。
eye of faith. I want to love you enough。
to say here tonight, Porch, and so many of。
you are guests in the room, thanks for。
giving us your time tonight and letting。
me go just a little bit long, but I want。
to love you enough to say, if your faith。
feels weak, it's likely because your sin。
has grown strong. It is likely because。
your sin has grown strong. And so what。
you must do is you must take action. You。
have to act. You have to first and。
foremost admit that you're wrong. You。
have to be willing to look to God and。
then look to others and say, "I have been。
off. I've fronted. I've postured. I've。
manipulated." So that way no one would。
know, but I am wrong and I'm sad over it.。
I'm grieved, not with a worldly grief, but。
with a godly grief. You have to confess。
your need for help. You have to be。
willing to look to God and to someone。
else and say, "And because I am, would you。
help me in these areas of my life? Let me。
not speak generally. Let me speak。
specifically with you and give you。
permission to do what it takes to。
protect me from myself." And then you。
have to turn away from your sin.。
Repentance often feels like a buzzkill。
because when we think about it, it's。
turning away from something that。
actually feels good. We can admit that.。
Sin wouldn't be, it wouldn't be devious。
if it didn't feel good. And yet it is。
turning away from what feels good and。
turning towards that which is better. But。
what about my porn addiction? Jesus is。
better. But what about my control issues?。
Jesus is better. But what about all of。
my body image problems? Jesus is better.。
Turn around and realize it for yourself.。
Take the first step and know that the。
step you've taken is not one that Christ。
has not taken himself. For he stepped out。
of heaven and into earth and he moved。
with the kind of, with the kind of。
emotion that was characteristic of the。
sort of sadness your repentance should。
feel because he was sad about the。
disconnect you had from God. He moved in。
and he wanted to bring you back to。
himself. He did everything it took in。
order to cross the chasm and bring you。
in right relationship. And yet what we。
know is that he not only shed the tear。
of faith, but he also, he was filled with。
the kind of grief that should be。
characterized by you in your sin. He felt。
not a godly grief, he was a God in grief。
moved by his compulsion and love for you。
to do whatever it took, even die your。
death upon a cross. And then he moved。
from that place knowing that there needed。
to be a radical removal of your sin. And。
he said, you know what will radically。
remove you from your sin? My resurrection.。
For though I die because of your sin, I。
will rise forth out of your sin and I。
will take you with me if you will place。
your faith in me. I will radically remove。
you from all that is wrong and I will。
radically restore you to all that is。
right. Jesus has taken the first step, he。
has shed the first tear. Will you take a。
step here tonight, not tomorrow, not the。
day after, not next week when it's。
convenient, right here tonight. Because he's。
already stepped towards you. Will you。
shed a tear? For Christ has shed a tear。
to save you unto himself forever. Let me。
pray for you. God we love you, thanks for。
tonight. You and I visited earlier about。
this, but God repentance, we might see。
the first fruits of here, but we will not。
see the full effect here. For God。
repentance does not happen only in an。
evening, it happens day by day, moment by。
moment, from this evening henceforth. I pray God please。
change minds here, turn people from their。
sin, that they might change their lives。
and walk with you instead. I just feel a。
sensing from the Spirit that some of you。
here do not know Jesus and he's calling。
you to turn around, he's calling you to。
come home, he's telling you place your。
faith in me. I'm good where you are not,。
I am right where you are wrong, I am。
perfect for all of your imperfection.。
Place your faith in me, call me the Lord。
of your life and walk with me as I lead。
you into your own. Others of you, you have。
been harboring that thing which you have。
hidden for so long, you have been。
struggling with that sin and it's time。
to make an end. Let victory ring out in。
this place, take action for Christ。
himself has taken action for you. We love。
you Jesus, thank you for tonight, it's in。
your name we pray, amen.。
