(upbeat music)。
- Well, hello porch friends, how we doing?。
(audience cheering)。
It is awesome to be here.。
My name's Todd, I get to hang out here at Watermark。
and drop in on the porch every now and then.。
It is awesome to be with you and all our friends。
that are dropping in online and they're hanging out。
in some other places.。
We are glad you're here.。
I know that we just finished this fantasy series。
about relationships, right?。
So what I'm gonna do is tie in a little bit to that series.。
We talked about the fantasy guy, the fantasy girl,。
the fantasy relationship, all that different stuff.。
I'm gonna talk to you about something that I think。
will drive you into this weekend,。
which is one of my favorite weekends of the year,。
just with a real heart of gratitude.。
I love this weekend because there's just not a lot。
you have to do, right, to get ready for it。
other than maybe find some folks to hang out with。
and find some food to take in.。
There's no shopping, no hustling, no getting around,。
but there is honestly something about holiday seasons。
that kind of can make it hard for some of us。
because we're like, man, I just wanna share my life。
and especially my holidays, this time when family。
gets together, some of you may not feel like you've got。
a family that are close and you certainly,。
you know, in our porch community, at this stage of life,。
often don't have somebody that's kind of slid a ring。
on her finger and said, you, I'm choosing you.。
That fantasy idea, I can remember,。
it wasn't that long ago for me.。
I can remember there were only really a couple of times a year。
maybe four times a year that were hard for me to be single.。
One of them was spring, right?。
When the azaleas were blooming and the birds were chirping,。
the weather was nice, everybody kind of crawls。
out of their cave, then hibernating,。
and you see all the couples at the park。
having a great time together and riding bikes。
and exercising together, spring was hard.。
The other time I can remember, summer,。
summer was hard, right?。
'Cause everybody goes to the lake,。
they get to go to the 4th of July party。
and lay a blanket out and lay next to somebody。
and watch fireworks, this reminds me of my heart。
right there, just explosions in the sky.。
(congregation laughing)。
And yeah, I think fall, fall was hard.。
Fall was tough, you know, sweater weather,。
where I was from, it got kind of cool,。
I was really skinny so I could wear like four layers。
of clothing and look like a man,。
and it was just awesome, you know?。
And we could go out there together, we could hang out,。
we could be together and just kind of, you know,。
snuggle by a little fire, winter, winter was hard.。
Right, 'cause it's Christmas, right?。
I mean, all the Hallmark movies were on。
and you're like, oh, is there ever gonna be,。
like I could be in like, you know,。
and that and not a movie but like me。
and Christmas gifts and under the tree and mistletoe,。
and like, so really, other than those four times a year,。
it was easy being single for me.。
But you know, we all have this fantasy。
because we have this idea, right?。
We have this idea that if we just got in a relationship,。
it'd just be awesome and really, honestly,。
the mindset of what that relationship would be like, right?。
Specifically the pursuit.。
Isn't that what you really want?。
I mean, relationships, we all know relationships are hard.。
But man, you know, when people are pursuing you。
and it's fresh and it's new, you know,。
and they're just consumed with the thought of being with you,。
what I wanna talk to you about tonight。
is the fantasy pursuit.。
Like, 'cause girls, I mean, I know, you know,。
just our world sells this dream that,。
I don't care if a dragon has locked you up。
in a castle, Fiona, there's this guy and he's not an ogre.。
I mean, he's a stud and he's coming after you。
and he's gonna rescue you from the dragon。
and the castle and loneliness。
and he'll go through hell to come to you.。
I mean, that's kind of in kind of every little girl's fantasy.。
Every guy wants to be pursued in the way that Fiona dreams。
about this gallant stud that she would respect。
and long to give herself to and share herself with.。
I mean, the fantasy pursuit, right, it's out there。
and it's a bit embedded in all of us。
because all of us, let's be honest,。
are just a little insecure, maybe a lot.。
And we're all kind of thinking, man,。
am I really worth love and am I really worth pursuing?。
(laughing)。
If alarms would go off that I've been lost。
and somebody wants to find me.。
(laughing)。
Tragically, I mean, you know, listen, honestly,。
that means there's an Amber Alert.。
How kind of ironic that that just happened.。
Now, we said, man, when a kid is lost,。
separated from those who want to provide and care for them,。
we let the whole world know and we want to come after you.。
Don't you really have that fantasy?。
I mean, I still do.。
Look, I've been married for almost 30 years。
and I want my wife to pursue me,。
not just go, yeah, I'm your wife.。
Of course we sleep together.。
No, I want my wife to want and long for me.。
I want it to be, you know, I've always said,。
and in fact, a guy named Martin Luther。
who lived a long time ago said this,。
a man should love his wife in such a way。
that she hates to see him leave。
and a woman should love her husband in such a way。
that he knows she can't wait till he gets home.。
What he's describing there is that we all,。
even when we're married, right,。
that we want to be pursued, not just tolerated.。
And there's this idea of just being pursued in general。
that is innate to who we are。
and all of us are kind of like, I don't know, man.。
I don't know if I'll ever, ever find somebody。
who really wants to run after me, who chooses me.。
I started thinking about this, you know,。
this week a little bit.。
I think about all the love songs that are out there, right?。
I mean, you know, in the '80s, Randy Travis,。
"My Love is Deeper than a Holler," man, right?。
And just all these songs that talk about this love,。
you know, Blake Shelton, "You'll Be My Honey Bee,"。
you know, "I'm This to My That,"。
and "We're Gonna Be This to That," right?。
And I'll just do whatever I've got to get to you.。
I started thinking about great classic movie scenes.。
Y'all fans of "The Last of the Mohicans"?。
Oh man, come on, right?。
Do you remember this scene right here of Hawkeye and Cora?。
It is when they're hanging out right then,。
that he's fallen in love with her.。
She has given his heart to him,。
and they're being chased, right, by the whole British army.。
And they're at this place where they're kind of in a cave。
behind a waterfall,。
and they're kind of unable to protect themselves anymore.。
And Hawkeye's just sitting there,。
and he's just looking at Cora,。
and he knows he's got to make a decision.。
He knows if he stays there,。
they're gonna kill him in front of her,。
which will break her heart.。
He can't defend them in any way.。
And so he just grabs her,。
and he looks at her and he goes, "Stay alive!。
"You hear me?。
"You serve!。
"You survive!。
"You stay alive!。
"I will find you!。
"No matter how long it takes,。
"no matter how far, I will find you!"。
And then he just runs through this wall of water,。
and just dives into the darkness, right?。
He's like, "Man!。
"What a stud!"。
You know?。
And if you're Cora, you're like, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!"。
(congregation laughing)。
And we just, I'm just telling you,。
that's one of those things, it's this fantasy moment.。
I'm like, "I wanna be Hawkeye!。
"I think I could, I'd wanna be Cora。
"if Hawkeye would say that to me.。
"I mean, who doesn't wanna be loved like that?"。
I started to look out there,。
and I came across this story。
just about great love stories, right?。
Here's one, I'm just gonna,。
I'm gonna just, for a little bit more,。
I'm just setting the stage here, okay?。
And there's this girl, Jessica Sharman is her name.。
Here's a picture of Jessica and her, at the time, fiance,。
when they were in love.。
But Jessica, her whole life, had had epileptic seizures.。
She really never suffered much from the seizures,。
other than just the actual seizure itself.。
But one time, they were out on a date,。
and they were on a train,。
and when they got off the train,。
her eyes rolled back in her head,。
and all her limbs went limp,。
and Richard just kinda took her,。
and he immediately dialed her parents' number,。
said, "What do I do, what do I do?"。
And they just go, "Hey, do this, calm down,。
"we'll call 911, and if she doesn't come out of it quickly,"。
and he did, and the parents kinda raced there,。
wasn't far from their home, and they got there,。
and Jessica didn't recognize her parents,。
certainly didn't recognize Richard,。
Jessica didn't even recognize pictures of herself,。
and she had what a neurologist said。
was a seizure-induced amnesia, which is very, very rare,。
and so she forgot her whole family,。
and certainly forgot Richard.。
But Richard pursued her, man, Richard wooed her again,。
I mean, the parents invited Richard over。
when she started to get well,。
and she said, "I was scared to death,。
"when they left me alone with him."。
She said, "I, I, I," you know,。
he starts to take her out to places, and say,。
"Hey, we used to do this together."。
And he just won her heart, she said,。
"I don't remember the first time I fell in love with Richard,。
"but I remember the second time."。
And you're like, dude, that's a movie, that's The Vow,。
right, that's what you're saying,。
that's the race of McAdams, right,。
that's Chandler Tatum, right,。
that's who that is, Channing Tatum, right,。
no, actually, that's a different deal.。
That was a true story, there's a couple came,。
called Kim and Cricket Carpenter,。
that that was their story, they wrote it into a book,。
that they made into a movie,。
but I'm like, either way, right?。
I'm like, I wanna be pursued like that,。
I want a guy who will fall in love,。
and I'll forget him, and he'll pursue me again.。
(congregation laughing)。
'Cause his vow is that he's gonna love me.。
Here's a really sweet one, true story.。
This is a dad, he ran a fruit stand in Sichuan, China.。
One day, he turned around his fruit stand,。
his little daughter was three years old,。
and in the crowd, she was swept up, he panicked.。
He could not find his three-year-old.。
There's no details, really, whether she was abducted。
or just what happened, but he just panicked,。
and in the chaos, in the crowd, it was in that marketplace,。
he lost his three-year-old.。
For 24 years, he looked for her.。
Never could find her.。
Eventually, he quit his job selling fruit。
and just drove a taxi, so that everybody。
who got in his taxi, he could give them a card,。
so this is my daughter, she was three, I lost her.。
I don't know what relationship you have,。
would you just tell somebody,。
if they've ever adopted a daughter or did this,。
that they would find her.。
Over 17,000 different contacts were made.。
He drove with signs all around his taxi。
of his daughter in this.。
After 24 years, a woman heard this,。
and she went and she wrote him, said,。
I think I might be your daughter.。
Got a DNA test, it was his daughter,。
and found her, 24 years.。
Amazing story.。
Before Amber alerts of a loving father。
seeking a daughter, last one, this one's kinda tragic.。
This is a gal, okay, and her name is, I'll look it up,。
it's I, Sam Diego, and that's her cat, Diego.。
Look how happy she is.。
But she was fortunate enough to lose her cat.。
(congregation laughing)。
And she looked for her cat for two years,。
and then she found her.。
Look how upset she is when she finds her cat.。
She's bawling, right?。
That's a tragic story, it's a tragic story.。
The girl thought she finally lost her cat,。
and dagnabed cat found its way home.。
(congregation laughing)。
(congregation laughing)。
That one grabs me.。
(congregation laughing)。
Look, all right, we all just had this fantasy pursuit。
that somebody would care for me.。
Well, I'm gonna just tell you a story, I'm not gonna,。
you know, this one, this is one of those messages, guys,。
that I just, I can't pray enough。
that you'll believe it's true.。
Because I don't know if part of your story。
is that there's ever going to be another individual。
that pursues you, I just don't know, I really don't.。
But I wanna tell you something,。
I know that if somebody pursues you,。
and you haven't understood the love。
I'm about to be talking about,。
and the radical pursuit that's here,。
it won't matter because you're gonna mess it up.。
And until you know how radically loved you are,。
and how radically valuable you are,。
all that's gonna happen with people that pursue you。
is in your neediness, and in the imperfection。
of one human to love another human,。
you're gonna mess that relationship up,。
and you're gonna go into an epileptic sin seizure,。
and you're gonna forget how much you were sure。
this person would make you happy.。
Because there is no person that can love you。
the way that you need to be loved,。
except a person that has themselves been forgiven much,。
and so they love much.。
We talked a lot about this in the series, right,。
in the different parts of that little fantasy series,。
and what I just wanna share with you tonight。
is a true story, and it's a radical story,。
it's almost an offensive story.。
When you understand what God asked a human to do。
in order to illustrate his zealousness,。
and his love for guys like me,。
and gals like you, and guys like you.。
There's a book in your Bible,。
and the book is called Hosea,。
and if you got your Bible,。
turn to the book of Hosea, it'd be awesome.。
Hosea means literally salvation,。
that's what the name Hosea means.。
It means that there is going to be this overwhelming,。
never-ending, reckless love poured out on you。
that will turn into the one thing that you desperately want。
in your insecurity, and uncertainty,。
informed by your self-knowledge of your imperfection,。
you just wonder, is there anybody who can save me。
from the loneliness of my brokenness?。
And what I wanna tell you, I mean,。
obviously you guys aren't clueless,。
you see where this is going,。
and what I'm just gonna tell you。
is that the radical pursuit that we all really want。
can only really be found in one place.。
Now what God did is he took Hosea, he was a prophet,。
and prophets weren't just people that spoke,。
prophets were sometimes folks that revealed。
an attribute of the characteristic of God。
that people were unfamiliar with or had lost touch with。
so that they could get their arms around it,。
often in a very experiential way.。
God had his prophets do some really crazy stuff.。
I mean, go read the book of Ezekiel at one point.。
Ezekiel was a prophet that was there to tell the people。
that God wasn't kidding when he said。
there was gonna be a consequence。
of them kind of putting him off and ignoring him,。
and the way that he established。
that the discipline that they were gonna be under was real。
is he asked Ezekiel basically to go through a melodrama。
which had him cooking his food over dung,。
laying on his side in a public square。
for about a year and a half.。
You're kinda like, what in the world?。
What kind of God would ask a guy to do that。
just to get a message through?。
And that is a God that really is serious。
about the message getting through to people,。
and he was willing to ask guys to do pretty amazing things。
to get that message through.。
Now here's one that is one of the most shocking。
in all the scripture.。
Let me just tell you this.。
The guy's name, Hosea, means salvation.。
Hosea was a prophet to the nation of Israel,。
and the nation of Israel, I wanna give you a little bit。
of a context of who they were, right?。
There were people that were in bondage,。
there were people that were just like everybody else,。
and God chose to reveal himself uniquely。
through a relationship that he would pursue。
with certain humans that would eventually。
make the rest of the world take notice。
of the unique way that these people were loved.。
Now you need to know this.。
These people happen to be what we call today。
the Jewish people, and you kinda go,。
why were the Jewish people chosen?。
The answer is just because God chose to use them.。
He didn't love them more than anybody else.。
He just said, I'm gonna especially use you,。
and in my love for you that I pour out on you,。
it's gonna make other people go,。
what is going on with you people?。
And the Jews were to answer, nothing's going on with us.。
We're just like you.。
We're just as rebellious and just as lost。
and just as desperate and just as insecure,。
but we're not trying to figure out how to work。
toward this God that we don't really know and understand.。
God has revealed himself to us。
and shown us how we can know him,。
even though we ourselves are not worthy of being pursued.。
God has pursued us and rescued us,。
and we're no longer a slave to the best ideas of men.。
We're now set free by the revelation of God,。
and look what he's done for us.。
He's not our God.。
He is the God.。
Come and know him.。
What's really interesting is that you're gonna find out。
that when God rescues people,。
he never does that through performance, through the law.。
The law was given to the Jewish people to show them。
that this God that is pursuing them is a holy God,。
and you're not a very holy people,。
which is why you're constantly in trouble,。
because you've left the God who is kind。
and left the God who is a loving father,。
and so when you leave a loving father,。
you get a hateful one.。
When you leave the God who is life, you're gonna get death,。
and when you leave the God who is light,。
you're gonna get darkness.。
And so God's just bringing the light and the love back。
to the world by loving Abraham and his descendants.。
Now, what's interesting is Moses gave the law,。
but Moses couldn't lead the people。
into the place of promise.。
It was actually another guy.。
His name was Yeshua, Joshua.。
Joshua's name has the name Hosea in it,。
except the first part of it, Jehovah Yeshua,。
Joshua, the Lord saves.。
You know what's really interesting?。
There's another guy who has the name Yeshua,。
but not in Hebrew.。
In Greek, his name is Jesus.。
That is the Greek Yeshua.。
That's the Greek name for the Lord saves,。
and you're gonna see that ultimately,。
what Joshua was a picture of,。
the one who can deliver you by grace。
into the place of promise is who Jesus was.。
What Hosea is a picture of,。
Jesus is the one who accomplishes it,。
but what is the story of Hosea?。
Let me remind you, because in it, you're gonna see。
that there's a fantasy pursuit of you and me。
that is almost offensive.。
It's interesting, you know, it won't surprise you。
the way we're gonna close this message。
is by singing a song that right now。
is I think helpful to all of our hearts, right?。
We've been singing a lot, just the reckless love of God.。
As some people go, is that theologically correct。
that you would sing a song?。
God doesn't do anything reckless.。
He's not a God of confusion.。
Should you sing a song that's like God is reckless?。
Look, here's the deal, here's what you need to know.。
All right?。
I think it's a fair question.。
I mean, it's a good question.。
I'm glad you care about words, whoever you are asking that,。
but we're speaking here anthropomorphically, okay?。
I didn't say that very well, did I?。
(congregation laughing)。
We're speaking here in a way that is understandable to men.。
The love that I'm about to describe to you。
is a love that just seems really unreasonable.。
And to us, it just seems really, really reckless.。
It seems overwhelmingly impossible.。
Man, but if it's true, if it's true,。
it's true.。
And so, I think it's a good question.。
I think it's a good question.。
I think it's a good question.。
I think it's a good question.。
I think it's a good question.。
