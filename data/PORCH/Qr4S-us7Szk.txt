[MUSIC]。
All right, Porsche, how we doing?。
We doing okay tonight?。
[APPLAUSE]。
Amazing.。
Hey, it's so great to be here with you.。
Thanks for making the time to join us here.。
Those of you that are in the room,。
it's always a pleasure to spend a little bit of time with you.。
But all of you that are tuning in online,。
thanks for giving us your evening as well.。
We're so grateful to be a part of a generation where God is。
doing something really significant.。
That's kind of what we've been journeying through as we've。
been looking at this series.。
But before I get ahead of myself,。
let me give a special shout out,。
not just to those of you tuning online,。
but also Portslie, Greater Lafayette, Fresno, and Scottsdale.。
God is doing a great thing here.。
He is doing a great thing in so many different places,。
and we're just glad to be a part of it.。
Hey, let me just lead off with this.。
The topic that we're working through tonight is of considerable。
importance. And because that's the case,。
I don't necessarily want us to rush all the way through it.。
I sat down and I considered, man,。
what can I cut from this thing?。
And I had others do the same alongside of me.。
And we said, no,。
there's not much here that we feel like we can discard.。
We believe that God wants to speak to you from the passage。
we're going to study.。
And it might just take a little bit of time,。
but sometimes things deserve an extended opportunity for the。
Lord to work.。
But before I get there,。
let me just open up with a story.。
You might be sitting there thinking to yourself,。
"Kylin, did you get a little sun this weekend?"。
And the answer would be, "Yes, I did get some sun this weekend,。
but not by way of how most people would.。
I wasn't sitting by the pool.。
I wasn't sipping something nice.。
I wasn't working on my tan."。
You see, this white boy,。
he burns much faster than you might think.。
I was actually outside working on a construction project that。
I've taken upon myself.。
I am trying to build a covered pergola for my back patio,。
which has been awesome.。
I enjoy working with my hands.。
It's been great for me to dust off some of the old skills that。
I developed on the old family farm in East Texas.。
And it's been cool to work through some problems that I've。
encountered as I've been trying to bring my vision into reality.。
It's always fun to measure twice and cut once and realize,。
"Man, I should have measured three times to try to figure out。
what's the alternative solution."。
There's something really rewarding in looking at what you're。
building by way of the sweat of your brow.。
You know, like I have enjoyed this process and by way of me。
doing it on my own,。
I am saving a lot of money,。
which is just a small addition to why this matters.。
You see, it has not financially cost me nearly what it would if。
I had contracted it out and had someone come do it instead.。
But, and there's a big but here, it has cost me nonetheless.。
What do I mean by that?。
You see, this is not just your run-of-the-mill, average。
Saturday afternoon chore where you roll up your sleeves and。
you give it the good college try for a few hours.。
That's not what we're talking about here.。
This is a major construction project, the likes of which has。
led me to become a Home Depot Pro member.。
One where I'm not just building something that is constructed,。
but I'm also running electric.。
I'm trying to prepare something, the likes of which we will。
enjoy, not just for a little while, but for a long while.。
And because that's the case, it has cost me far more than I。
ever expected whenever I initially agreed to this.。
It has cost me, in the realm of long weekends where I could。
be doing other things, but instead I'm doing this.。
It has cost me hours outside of the gym.。
It has cost me one Memorial Day trip to the lake.。
And if I'm not careful, it's going to cost me something。
that's happening on July 4th too.。
I have to work quickly because this project is costing me。
at a level I did not expect.。
So then why do I keep doing it?。
Because there's not much return on value for a half-finished。
patio cover when it comes to property value.。
You know, like I need to make sure that I get it done.。
But in addition to that, what I'm learning is that there。
are some things worth a considerable cost.。
I'm realizing like the hope of what we'll be hosting friends。
over and sitting out on our back patio as the sun goes down。
and enjoying dinner.。
That's something I'm really looking forward to.。
Or getting it done in time for the fall so I can watch college。
football with other friends and we can enjoy the cool of。
the evening in America's favorite pastime.。
I'm looking forward to or the dream of hanging up my son's。
baby swing on the I-beam that goes over the front of it。
is exciting.。
These are things that help me to look at all that it is。
requiring me, how much a cost I'm actually incurring in。
saying this project is worth it.。
Anyways, the vision of what I have one day is well worth。
the value of what I'm losing right now.。
Why do I tell you all that?。
Because in the Christian life, there are seasons of time,。
chapters that you will live where you voluntarily endorse。
some considerable cost for a very considerable purpose.。
Just like no one was forcing me to build this patio.。
I could have hired it out.。
You too will want to build something in your life, but it。
will cost you.。
It will require you to opt into inconvenience.。
It will force you to give up some measure of comfort and。
it's ultimately going to put you in a position where you。
self-select out of what you could have in order to have。
what you want to have.。
So what is it that you might build?。
You're going to build a consecrated life, a consecrated。
life, which is a life of uncommon devotion to God.。
That's what consecration is.。
Not a word that we use very frequently today, something。
you probably haven't read aside from the scriptures themselves.。
And yet there is something worth building into your life,。
which is called consecration and it is defined as an uncommon。
devotion to God.。
And the emphasis as we talk about that definition is really。
in the word uncommon because although there are seasons of。
consecration riddled throughout the scriptures, there are。
very few seasons of consecration riddled throughout our lives.。
It is a normality when you open the pages of this book, but。
it's an abnormality when you consider the pages of your。
story.。
And the reason for that is really understandable.。
Consecration is hard.。
It's hard, not just hard to learn about.。
That's actually not as difficult, but it is a very hard。
thing to live.。
It's a hard thing to apply.。
You see, we live in a society that is saturated by and are。
part of a generation that is infatuated with comfort, whether。
it's skipping anything longer than a six-second advertisement。
on your favorite YouTube video or making sure that your。
groceries are only available at curbside so you never actually。
have to walk inside the store or raging against Apple because。
how dare they only release one episode every single week.。
I want all of the episodes right now.。
We have become incredibly comfortable in our culture.。
And listen, I'm not self-righteous about this.。
I'm not a hater to this reality.。
I love the fact that I can prime anything I need to my door。
at this moment.。
And yet we live in a comfort culture that is selling our。
generation on the idea that stress is bad.。
That anything less than good must be toxic.。
And if you're struggling, you should stop.。
That's what our culture is telling us.。
And that's just not true.。
In fact, what we know is it's actually false.。
The scriptures would tell us that anything worth having is。
going to require something of you.。
And that which is most worthy of having, which is God himself,。
that which we would love to lay our hands upon, is worthy of。
giving up as much as we can in order to grab hold of him.。
You see, the life that you want is not the life that the world。
is promising.。
It's not a life of comfort and ease.。
That life that's brimming with potential, that's boasting。
really great promise, that's packed with all the kind of。
passion you want to characterize your story, the life that。
Jesus has come to give you.。
And yet the life that so often we settle so much less for,。
that life, it comes by way of consecration, not by way of。
comfort.。
And so tonight I want to talk to you about this idea of。
consecration.。
I want to help you understand how do you actually live into。
this kind of reality where you can experience the sort of。
life that so many of us want for.。
In order to do it, we're going to look at what the Apostle。
Paul says in his letter to Timothy.。
So if you have a Bible, you can turn with me to 2 Timothy。
chapter 2. While you're doing that, we've been in a series。
called Revive, where we're studying the principles of personal。
renewal. And the reason why we've been looking at personal。
renewal is because we're firm believers that you do not find。
revival by seeking revival.。
You find revival by seeking renewal. As we've been saying,。
it's sort of a tagline of this series, which has been adopted。
from smarter revivalists than myself.。
I would not even dub myself as such. What we believe is that。
widespread revival begins with inner renewal. And we're seeing。
it. Like this is happening, not just in our nation, it's。
happening all around the globe.。
You can look back at past weeks and see all the statistics。
that we've rolled up.。
But what we understand is there is a genuine surge of。
spirituality where God is doing something significant in。
the lives of people just like yourself.。
But what's fascinating about it is he's not just calling people。
back to the faith and reigniting their love for Jesus.。
No, it actually goes further than just that. Because what。
we're seeing is individually people are returning to the。
church. They're committing to study the scriptures.。
They're getting baptized, which may not feel important to。
you, but it's very important because what it does is it。
articulates the idea that inner renewal leads to revival.。
Because what we're seeing is that people are being moved by。
God and not in the public places through a massive event or。
some sort of emotional upheaval.。
That's not where he's moving most. Where he's moving most。
is in the secret places, the places of your heart.。
Now as I say that, I know you're like, well, Kylin, isn't。
this a massive event?。
Aren't we a part of a giant spectacle? Won't we likely。
experience some sort of emotional upheaval? You might,。
but here's the thing that I want you to know. Though God。
might begin the process of renewal here, that process does。
not end here. It must go with you. It has to leave these。
doors and it must engage with you in the regular day-to-day。
rhythms of your life.。
You see, God is moving in a way that we should want for.。
And I've said this and I'm saying it to you again tonight.。
Like I am unapologetic in my desire for more of God here。
at The Porch. God has done a good thing for the last 20。
years. And yet I believe that the best things are even still。
ahead of us. That every day with God can be better than。
the last day with God. I want him for myself.。
I want him for you. I want him for this room.。
I want him for our city.。
I want him for our generation.。
But the way you get more of God。
is you give more of yourself.。
The way you get more of God is you give more of yourself.。
That's the idea behind consecration. Like it's not just。
giving up aspects of your life. It is giving up the entirety。
of your life to God. I like the way that Adrian Rogers puts。
it. He says, "Consecration is not giving God anything.。
It is taking your hands off of that which already belongs。
to him." Which can feel really intimidating to consider.。
Like that's a bold claim. And yet as we consider the claim。
of consecration, Paul is going to walk us through a series。
of steps we can take so that way it becomes true in our。
life. So that way we can let go of some of the things in。
this life. That way we might grab hold of more of God for。
our lives. And the reason we're looking at his letter。
to Timothy is he is writing this as sort of his swan song.。
You see, 2 Timothy is Paul's last letter ever written.。
He's sort of on his deathbed and he is pinning this moment。
to his protege and he's wanting to communicate to him a。
variety of important things. But dead center of the letter。
is this call to consecration. He's looking at Timothy。
and he's saying, "Hey, you, a young adult, someone in。
your mid to late 30s that's running a really big organization。
and facing a lot of people problems within your midst."。
Sound like anybody you know? There are a few things you。
need to focus on. They'll ultimately lead you from the。
life you have to the kind of life that God wants. And so。
he leads off and he says, 2 Timothy chapter 2 verse 20,。
"Now in a great house, there are not only vessels of gold。
and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honorable。
use, but some for dishonorable." You see, Paul tells him。
that in God's house, there are two different types of。
vessels. There are honorable vessels and there are。
dishonorable vessels. What does he mean by that? Well,。
it's interesting. There's not a clear consensus when。
it comes to the interpretation of what Paul specifically。
means. There's a wide debate, but most scholars land。
in one of two places whenever it comes to this subject.。
They either believe that Paul is speaking about true。
and false believers, that in the church, not only in。
Ephesus, but in rooms like our own or in the church。
that you attend, there are going to be people that。
ardently follow after Jesus and there are going to be。
people that do not follow after Jesus at all. That's。
one interpretation. The other interpretation is that。
Paul is speaking about two different statuses of。
believer. Don't think varsity versus JV, that there's。
one group of believer that's better than another.。
That's not what he's saying. What you should instead。
think is that there's one group of believers that。
are more committed than the other. It's like full-time。
employees versus part-time employees. Whatever your。
interpretation is, the result is still the same. Paul。
is telling us that the goal of your life is to be a。
vessel of honorable use. Why is that? Because the。
kind of vessel you are directly correlates with the。
kind of purpose you have. The kind of vessel you are。
directly correlates with the kind of purpose you。
have. So in my house, the most honorable vessel that。
we own is the fine china from our wedding. You know,。
that thing that people spend an exorbitant amount。
of money on that you never actually seem to use.。
That's the finest piece of dishware we have. It's。
the most honorable vessel we use, and we only use。
it for our most distinguished house guests. And so。
honorable is this vessel that we never put it in。
the dishwasher. No, no, no. How dare we consider。
such a thing? We always hand wash every single。
plate. We hand dry every single plate. And if it。
doesn't go back in the cabinet, it probably goes。
back in the box. Like this is the most honorable。
vessel we have. If you were to walk in my home and。
I chose instead to serve you with paper plates,。
that would communicate something different about。
the level of importance in our evening. What it。
would say is that this vessel is not nearly as。
honorable as the last. Therefore, this moment must。
not be as honorable as the last. You see, the kind。
of vessel correlates to the kind of purpose. Now,。
could I use paper plates for our most distinguished。
dinners? Yes, I can, but I don't want to. That's。
what Paul's getting at. You see, Paul is articulating。
our first point that although God can use any。
kind of person, he wants to use a consecrated。
kind of person. Although God can use any kind of。
person, he wants to use a consecrated kind of。
person. Like it's true. He can use anybody he。
wants, and he does it all throughout his scriptures.。
He uses the prostitute Rahab. He chooses a。
rebellious prophet in Jonah. He grabs a real。
like a real swindler in Jacob, and he moves and。
he grabs a murderous religious man in Saul, and。
he uses them all for his purposes. He can use。
anybody he wants, but God wants to use people。
that want to be used by him. God wants to be used.。
He wants to use people that want to be used by。
him. That's what 2 Chronicles 16 9 says. It says,。
"For the eyes of the Lord they run to and fro。
throughout the whole earth to give strong support。
to those whose heart is blameless toward him."。
That verse is certainly written at a very specific。
moment in Israel's history, and yet the principle。
still remains true today. God is searching for a。
people that he can give strong support to. What。
is the criteria for that people? The criteria。
for that people is not impressiveness. It's。
blamelessness, which is encouraging to me. Like。
we live in a culture of mega church pastors and。
Christian influencers, and yet what we're encouraged。
by is that our spiritual inferiority by way of。
we don't look as cool, or we don't sound as cool,。
or we're not quite as articulate as they are, or。
we're not as greatly gifted as they are. All of。
that inferiority is pushed aside and done away。
with because God is not worried about anointing。
the particularly gifted. He uses them for sure,。
but he is particularly specific about anointing。
the blameless. That's what he cares about. He。
wants to use blameless people. What does that。
even mean? Blamelessness is the avoidance。
of the appearance of evil. That's what it is,。
which can feel like an impossible target to hit.。
Kylan, I'm not blameless. Like even when I do。
my best, like even when I wake up in the morning。
and I have the best of intent for my day, I still。
stumble and fall. I do things I know that I'm。
not supposed to do. God knows that. God isn't。
looking at you and saying, "Hey, I'm looking for。
a perfect people." No, he is looking for a。
blameless people, a people that persist in their。
desire for spiritual improvement. That's what。
he wants, a people that are avoiding even the。
appearance of evil. That's why he says we must。
cleanse ourselves in verse 21. He says, "Therefore。
if anyone cleanses himself from what is。
dishonorable, he will be a vessel of honorable。
use." Anybody in here ever mistakenly loaded a。
clean dishwasher full of dirty dishes? Like you。
decided, "I think this is all dirty." And so you。
grab a bunch of dirty dishes from the sink and。
you put them in only to learn, "No, that was。
clean." Has that ever happened to you? That has。
happened to me. What do you do in that moment?。
You don't carefully inspect every single item.。
Look at all the utensils to see which ones are。
dirty. You don't do that. Why? Because the danger。
of putting that dishonorable fork in your mouth。
is one that you cannot bear. And so you rerun。
the whole load. It's not worth the risk. That's。
what we must do whenever it comes to our personal。
contamination. We must likewise cleanse ourselves。
in so fervent a way. So how do we do that? Well,。
Paul talks to us about a couple of different。
things we can do over the course of his letters.。
I'm going to try to synthesize here in this。
moment. We talked about this a lot last week.。
And so you can go reference the sermon from。
just a week ago. But here right now, I want to。
tell you four things you can do to help you。
cleanse yourself. Here's what they are. You need。
to assess the who, the what, the when, and the。
where of your defilement. We'll go through them。
one by one. You need to assess the who. Like we。
need to consider what kind of contaminating。
company are we keeping? Who is it that we're。
spending time around, that we're frequenting。
the presence of, that does not actually uplift。
our souls but drags us into unnecessary sin?。
Where are we making rationalizations for the。
relationships in our life? Because well, they're。
my friends or that's my community group. When。
in reality, all it's doing is desensitizing。
you to the things that God cares about. Where。
is that happening in your story? Let me just。
say, this does not mean that we should。
distance ourselves from sinners. No, we draw。
near to sinners. We ourselves are sinners, but。
those that don't know God, we come close to。
them too. Jesus loved being around sinners. He。
broke bread with them. He set a table with。
them. And yet here's what you need to know.。
Every time he did, his motivation was not。
pleasure. It was purpose. He had a purpose in。
being around contaminating company. What's。
interesting is as you read Paul's letters, you。
realize he's actually not quite as concerned。
about your relationships with the defiled in。
the world. He's more concerned about your。
relationships with the defiled in the church.。
That's where he's more concerned. It says in。
1 Corinthians 5, "I wrote to you in my letter。
not to associate with the sexually immoral。
people." Catch this. Not at all meaning the。
people of this world who are immoral or greedy。
and swindlers, idolaters. In that case, you。
would have to leave this world. But now I'm。
writing to you that you must not associate。
with anyone who claims to be a brother or。
sister. That would be a believer that is。
sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or。
slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Don't even。
eat with such people. That feels like a strong。
statement. And yet it does not diminish the。
truth. So where in your life are you。
rationalizing relationships with other。
Christians? Because, man, they're your friends,。
they're your community, they're your lifelong,。
your besties. And yet it is toxic to your soul.。
It could be that group of friends that, man,。
they never go out and get drunk. That would。
ruin our witness. And yet they don't have a。
problem getting together in the safety of。
their home and having a few one too many. It。
could be that buddy of yours that, man, he。
loves to praise God and yet from the same。
mouth, he speaks profanity and makes vulgar。
jokes at the expense of other people. It could。
be that you have a group of friends that,。
man, they love to get together and they know,。
man, hey, the church is a unity of diversity。
that we're not supposed to look all the same.。
And yet it would really mess up the social。
dynamic if we invited that person. You see,。
these are the types of relationships that we。
need to investigate because they contaminate.。
That's what Paul is telling you. You have to。
assess the who. Who is it that is potentially。
defiling you? If you want to get more of God,。
then you might have to give them up. We'll go。
quick. The what of your defilement is we need。
to consider what activity in our lives is。
making us unclean. You see, this does not just。
amount to sex, drugs, and drunkenness. It。
actually goes so much further. Like we need。
to consider what it is we consume. Like how。
good is it for your heart to watch the。
Secret Lives of Mormon Wives? How good is。
it for your soul to read A Court of Thorn。
and Roses every night before you go to sleep?。
What's it doing to your spirit to listen to。
people like Tate McRae and Chapel Rowan?。
This may feel very extreme. Look at me. This。
might feel extreme. Consecration is extreme.。
If you're content settling for a life that is。
less than the one Christ has come to give。
you, have your way. And yet if you want more,。
if you want to seize the kind of life that is。
available to you, then all of these things are。
worthy of giving away. That's the what. The。
third is the when. We need to know when we're。
defiling ourselves. And this one's really。
important because most of your sin, it works。
like clockwork. Like if you consider the things。
you do in your life that you regret at the end。
of the day, they typically pop up at very。
rhythmic times. It happens every evening after。
11 p.m. when you should already be asleep.。
It's every Saturday whenever you're at the。
pool with your friends. It occurs at the end。
of every month whenever reports are due and。
you're stressed out of your mind. It's happy。
hour on Mondays after a long work day.。
Romans 13 says, verses 13 through 14, "Let us。
walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies。
and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and。
sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy.。
Put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no。
provision for the flesh to gratify its desires."。
You see, some of the best things we could。
do tonight is we could cleanse our calendars.。
We consider where is it that I'm being led。
astray in my defilement that I can actually。
take time back for. And then the last is the。
where, the where of your defilement. We need。
to take inventory of where we go that we always。
leave with more regret than when we arrived.。
Like is it the gym? Is it brunch every weekend。
with the girls, with the guys? Is it being。
over at your girlfriend's house with the lights。
down low and the door shut behind? Maybe it's。
every time you go home to see your family, you。
revert right back into the same patterns that。
you've worked so hard to get away from. Where。
are you so very frequently defiled? I don't。
know where it is, but here's what I would say,。
and this is strong, you should stop going. And。
as I say that, here's what I know, like excuses。
just start popping off. But Kylan, like a guy's。
got to work out. Or you think that I can't help。
the fact that work sends me on a trip. You know。
what? I don't want to do what I do in that hotel。
room, but it's my job, man. Or maybe you think。
like, no, no, no, like that interview league,。
like I have to be there. I'm the best on the team.。
If I'm not there, then they're never going to。
win. I don't know what it is. But rather than。
reaching for so many excuses, what if you reach。
for solutions instead? What if you actually。
considered what do I need to do so that way I。
do not do what I need to do? That makes sense?。
You've got to let go of that which is gripped。
so very, so very fast of you. The sin which so。
easily entangles you have to get rid of it so。
that we can get as much of God as possible. This。
is the way of consecration. God wants to use。
you as you should be, not just as you are. That's。
the first step. The second step is in verse 21。
as well. It says, "Therefore, if anyone cleanses。
himself from what is dishonorable, he will be。
a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy,。
useful to the master of the house, ready for。
every good work." So based on what Paul is。
saying here, this is really important. He's not。
just saying that there are honorable vessels.。
He's also saying there are honorable uses, which。
tells us something important. Consecration is。
uncomfortable, but it's always purposeful.。
Consecration is uncomfortable, but it is always。
purposeful. According to Paul, the goal isn't。
just to become an honorable vessel, but to fulfill。
an honorable use. I don't know what that does。
for you, but that exhilarates me. That gets me。
excited because I don't just want to be someone。
that is polished up. I want to be someone that。
is purposed for. I want to have a purpose in my。
life, driven to do something that is great,。
that's worthy, that makes an impact. Listen to。
me. God is the one that gives those things. There。
is no cause like the cause of Christ. There is。
no kingdom worth building than his kingdom。
itself. And so if you're looking for a purpose。
to live into, God has not just come to polish。
you. He has come to purpose you. And it's a。
purpose the likes of which you could not dare。
dream find anywhere else. So several years ago,。
I was visiting with a lady in our church. She。
was telling me about her son who was serving。
in the special forces. He had just come home,。
spent a little time with her, and he was。
returning back to active duty, into deployment.。
And she was telling me about everything he。
did. It included things the likes of which many。
men would wish were true in their own lives.。
He was jumping from planes, and he was shooting。
targets 2,000 yards off, and he was engaging in。
guerrilla warfare. He was learning how to。
stabilize disrupted regions. And as she was。
telling me all of this, I had to ask her, "Does。
that not make you afraid when you consider all。
the danger he faces?" And I'll never forget her。
response. She looked at me and said, "God made。
my son to be a warrior. And so somehow, because。
that is his purpose, he is safer on the front。
lines of some foreign fight than he would ever。
be sitting on my couch at home." She knew。
something important. The safest place for you。
is within your purpose. That's what Paul is。
trying to tell us here. God's purpose is not。
just to cleanse you, but it's to use you.。
Now, he wants to use you, not just in the small。
ways you expect, but likely in the big ways。
you might forget. Like, I don't know about you,。
but more than likely, God wants to use your。
life by way of your hand to bring the least。
likely into saving faith. Like, he wants to。
empower your voice to be the one that speaks。
gospel identity and security into those family。
members that you have been praying for for so。
long. Don't you want God to use you to be the。
one to bring his manifest presence into your。
workspace or around your house or amongst your。
neighbors because you just pray ardently that。
he would show up? Don't you want God to lean。
into your life and give more power to you, not。
for your own glorification, not for your own。
reputation, but so that way he can get glory,。
they can get good, and you can get gladness.。
Don't you want that? Listen, that is what God。
wants. He wants to give you greatly, not for。
you in and of yourself, but for himself and。
for others as well. That's the heart of God.。
He wants to use you for a great purpose. You。
see, consecration is not just about purging。
yourself of impurity, it's about preparing。
yourself for destiny. So how do you do that?。
Well, Paul gives you a threefold way. He says。
you must set yourself apart as holy, you become。
useful to the master, and you are ready for。
every good work. You're set apart as holy. The。
word here in Greek is the same word used to。
be sanctified. The idea of sanctification is。
it's the lifelong process of becoming like。
Jesus. You see, consecration is not just about。
setting aside your sin and looking less like。
the world, it's about setting apart yourself。
and looking more like Christ. Do you see it?。
Consecration is the other side of repentance.。
They are one in the same, on the same coin,。
and yet repentance says, "Hey, turn away from。
these things," and consecration says, "Turn。
towards these things. Set yourself apart, move。
yourself towards greater holiness, become like。
Christ." I love the quote of C.S. Lewis on this。
idea. He says, "The more we let God take us over,。
the more truly ourselves we become, because he。
made us, he invented us, he invented all the。
different people that you and I were intended。
to be. It is when I turn to Christ, when I give。
up myself to his personality, that I first。
begin to have a real personality of my own."。
You see, whatever you set yourself apart to。
will determine what you become. So let me ask。
you, what are you setting yourself apart to?。
What are you setting yourself apart to? It's。
interesting. Consecration to God is so very hard。
for most of us, and yet we all consecrate。
ourselves to something every single day. Some。
of you have consecrated yourself so devotedly。
to your job, to the point that you're working。
70, 80, 90-hour weeks. Why? Because you want。
to become partner, because you want to make。
seven figures a year, because you want to be。
on Forbes 30 Under 30. So many of you have。
consecrated yourself to perfection, to the。
point that you clear your inbox every single。
day, and we hate you for it. You mark off every。
single thing on your to-do list, unlike most。
of us. You type, and you retype, and you retype。
that caption again and again and again, because。
you can't get it perfect enough. Why do you。
do that? Because you do not want to become a。
failure. You want to become approvable. So many。
of us are consecrated with our bodies, to the。
point that you count up a calorie, you never。
miss a class, how dare you think about missing。
your anabolic window, you get some work done.。
Why? Because you have a vision of what you。
want to look like, who you physically want to。
become. You are consecrating yourself to。
something, and that something is determining。
what you are becoming. If you're setting yourself。
apart to anything other than Christ, you are。
settling for less. You are settling for less.。
The more of God you give, the more of God you。
get, and there's nothing like God. You become。
useful to the master of the house. That's the。
second thing he says. What does it mean to be。
useful? It does not mean just to be available.。
It means to be helpful. I am not useful to my。
wife if I'm standing in the kitchen waiting for。
her to call me over. I'm just a waste of space.。
I am helpful to my wife whenever I start scrubbing。
dishes and cooking dinner and putting away。
groceries. That's when I become useful. Listen。
to me. So many of us were available for the work。
of God, but we're not helpful to the work of。
God. We're actually fully present, hoping he。
calls, and we're missing the fact that he's。
already called. I love this, man. Adam, Adam and。
Eve, that brother was waiting for a suitable。
partner, and yet he didn't just sit around。
available to the work of God. He was helpful to。
it. He named every single animal in the animal。
kingdom. That guy was working. He was helpful。
to the things of God. And in due time, God gave。
that brother what he wanted and what so many of。
you want as well. Why don't you move towards。
being helpful? For in your helpfulness, God will。
use you to be useful also. Friends, listen to。
me. Here's how you can tell if you're being。
useful. If you left the church tomorrow, would。
we feel your absence? Would we actually know?。
I remember facing this question several years。
ago and realizing the answer was no. I wasn't。
serving. I wasn't plugged in. I wasn't leading。
in any kind of capacity. I was just attending.。
I was just consuming. And had I left that day,。
no one would have known the wiser. Friends, this。
is important. No Christian is better than another.。
But some Christians are more useful than others.。
Some are more useful. Why don't you be useful?。
Get involved. Serve someplace. Get your membership。
in process. Join the church. Like choose to plug。
into what God is doing here. Start being helpful。
because that's what makes you useful for God.。
The third thing that he says is he says be ready。
for every work. The Greek here literally means。
to make ready. Not just that you're willing, but。
you're already made ready. Like the idea of this。
is what we studied about the Revolutionary War。
whenever we in grade school from the Minutemen.。
You remember those guys like that small group,。
the elite fighting force that they would pop up。
and spring in action at a moment's notice. That's。
what it means to be ready to work. It's to be a。
Minuteman to the glory of God and the good of。
Christ. Like that's what you're called to do.。
And every time this word for make ready or to。
prepare is using the scripture, it's always used。
or frequently used in advance of something big.。
Like just to give you a rundown. Like prepare。
the way of the Lord. Prepare the Passover meal.。
Jesus' burial was prepared. He was prepared before。
his burial. You prepared a place for the Ark of。
the Covenant to reside. The left and right hand。
seats beside Jesus in glory must be prepared by。
the Father. New Jerusalem was prepared. The city。
of God by God himself. The promised land was。
one which was prepared for the people to inherit.。
The bride of Christ is prepared, adorned for her。
husband. God prepares all throughout the scripture。
for really great things and he is prepared for。
you as well. Ephesians 2 10 says, "For we are。
his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good。
works, which God," what? "prepared beforehand that。
you should walk in them." God has already prepared.。
The question is, are you preparing yourself?。
Like do you have to be coaxed or urged or persuaded。
into action? Or are you ready for it? Like when。
you sit down with your boss and they talk start。
talking spiritual things, are you ready to share。
the gospel with them? Oh, no, Colin. That would。
be too much. Listen, that's what consecration。
looks like. It's saying I'm willing not just to。
do what's acceptable. I'm willing to do whatever。
it takes to give God a glory and lean into his。
purposes for my life. It is there where I feel。
totally out of control that I might actually see。
God moving away the likes of which I normally。
do not. Some of you, you need to consider if,。
man, am I ready to give up that paycheck to pay。
someone's rent because they can't make it this。
month? I don't know what it is. Consider the。
craziest thing in your mind. And the question。
is, are you prepared to do that? Are you prepared。
to do it? Because God wants to make you ready。
for every good work. Our third and final step.。
It's in verse 22. We'll go quick. He says, "So。
flee youthful passions, pursue righteousness,。
faith, love, and peace, along with those who。
call on the Lord from a pure heart." Paul reiterates。
here what he's been saying this entire time. He。
says, "Hey, there are some things that you need。
to set aside in your sin. There is some ways that。
you need to set yourself apart to God." And here。
in this moment, he tells you the heart behind。
it all. It's because you just want more of God.。
That's it. That's the heart that he's communicating。
here. You do all of these things. You do what。
feels so extreme, so even unnecessary, because。
you just want more of God. And listen to me.。
That is what God wants to. God is looking for。
a people that are looking for him. God is looking。
for a people that are looking for him. Are you。
looking for him? Yeah, man. I show up at church。
on Sunday. Yeah, man. I come to a group once a。
week. Go around, confess my sin. Yeah, man. I。
pay my monthly Christian membership fees. I。
make sure I get my quiet time in at least a。
couple times a week. That's not looking for him.。
Looking for God is one that's not trying to。
balance spiritual burnout, but is willing to。
burn for God instead. Willing to lean all the。
way forward into what he wants to give you,。
which is life, the likes of which you will find。
nowhere else. What's the cost? Everything. It。
costs you everything. You take up your cross,。
you die to yourself, and yet what do you find。
in return? Everything. You find Jesus, the one。
who leads you not just into life today, but。
life forever. He gives you what no one else can.。
And not only does he give you everything that。
you want, he is incomparable next to any other。
alternative. He is matchless in his beauty. He。
is transcendent beyond comprehension. There's。
no one like him. And so yes, we can say you're。
everything, Jesus, but your heart, if you were。
to see him more clearly, would say, I want you。
to be everything too. Are you looking for him?。
You see, consecration is a work that begins at。
an individual level, but imagine what God would。
do if hundreds of us were filled with this。
holy ambition to uncommonly devote ourselves。
to him. What would he do? What do you think。
God would do? I genuinely believe he would move。
in this room in ways we've never seen. He would。
move in our city in ways we've never seen. He。
would move in our generation in ways we've。
never seen. Not so people look back and say,。
man, it started in Dallas. No, so people know。
it started with him. That would be the result.。
God gives more of himself wherever we give。
more of ourselves. And the reason we know that。
that nothing should be off limits, that nothing。
is out of bounds, that nothing is ever too much。
is because Jesus looked at you and said, nothing。
is off limits. Nothing is too much. Nothing is。
out of bounds. I will go as far as I can to get。
to them. You know, when I started building that。
patio cover, all the thoughts of what would be。
hosting friends over and watching football and。
pushing my son in his swing, all of those things。
were deeply motivating for me. They were a good。
reason to absorb the considerable cost in order。
to pursue a considerable purpose. But those things。
are not the only reason why I still do it today.。
In fact, they might not be the biggest reason。
why I do it today. No, the biggest reason why I。
continue to pour myself out at great cost to。
myself to build the structure is because my dad。
is helping me build it. You see, when my father。
caught wind of what I was doing, how much it was。
costing, how hard I was working, he jumped into。
it with me. Yes, I was giving so much, but by the。
way, the time we get together, I have gotten far。
more in return. That's the promise of consecration.。
That as you pour out, God pours in. He pours in。
in a way that exceeds whatever it is you give.。
He wants to give more of himself to you. And the。
reason we know that is because he gave everything。
for you. We know when there was no one capable。
of living the perfect life, Jesus wanted to live。
the perfect life in your place. He did everything。
that you could not, so that he could have everything。
he wants to give. But not just that, he endured。
all of the discomfort of your sin because he was。
driven by a purpose the likes of which heaven。
rejoices in. One where sinners come home, the lost。
are found, the dead are saved. And when none of。
us were looking for him, he came looking for you.。
Looking for you, not just in life, not just in。
death, but looking for you in resurrection that。
he might give the resurrected life to any that。
would place their faith in him. When we were not。
pursuing him, he was pursuing you. When we were。
not willing to sacrifice for his sake, he was。
willing to sacrifice for yours. When we were not。
willing to devote all of our lives, he was willing。
to devote all of his love. Why? So that he might。
have you forever. Porch, let me ask you, do you。
want to be consecrated? You give more of God if。
you do. Is it uncomfortable? For sure. Is it。
worthwhile? Absolutely. Let me pray for you. God,。
thanks for tonight. Thanks for my friends here。
and their patience just as we work through this。
this evening. God, I know this topic is hard and。
it's heavy. I felt that God, even as I was prepping。
it, it's one that it can feel like, man, you're。
asking a lot of me, but really God, what we need。
believe is you are offering so much to us instead.。
The exchange right here is crazy. It's one where。
we give up not just the bad, but also some good.。
Why? So we can get God. And so Lord, I pray you。
would help us to understand you are not asking。
too much. Instead, you're giving too much. You're。
giving too much to an unworthy people. You're。
giving yourself for you have already given。
yourself in your son. I pray Lord, if there are。
any here that do not know you, they might know。
you tonight. They might see you, Jesus, place。
their faith in you as Lord and follow you forever.。
It's that easy. And for others, God, I pray, work。
your now Holy Spirit. Do the work of illumination,。
bring things to mind, the work of conviction,。
prick our hearts, but ultimately the work of。
transformation where you lead us not just to be。
better, but to be more like you. We love you.。
It's in your name we pray. Amen.。
