(bell rings)。
- Rebecca Leal, Port Stories, set free.。
- I grew up in a Christian home with parents。
who professed to be believers,。
all the while witnessing unhealthy conflict。
and abuse in my home.。
As a child, this made me feel scared,。
like I was always walking on eggshells,。
and that I really couldn't trust my parents.。
As a young kid, we went to church,。
and so I did believe that God,。
I did believe in God for my salvation and my eternity,。
but because I felt like I was always working really hard。
to get my parents' love and affection,。
that led me to believe that God didn't love me enough, too.。
That underlying belief really stuck with me。
through high school and well into college.。
After college, I decided to get braces,。
and I met my orthodontist tech,。
and she and I really hit it off in conversation,。
and she mentioned there was this place on Tuesdays。
called The Porch, and that I should go check it out.。
At the time, I was a different member of a church。
and wasn't really fully committed.。
So, a few months went by, and her and I。
just kept having conversations.。
I decided to commit and attend,。
and I don't remember specifically what that night was about。
other than I remember seeing and hearing。
what a real abiding faith looked like。
and hearing that the gospel was real。
and that God loved me enough to send Jesus to die for me.。
I remember going home that night,。
really kind of sitting in the faith。
that I professed to believe,。
and choosing to kind of make a different way。
and understanding that I couldn't work hard enough。
for God to love me.。
So, through that, I jumped all in through membership。
and into community, now get the opportunity。
to serve in different capacities。
and at The Porch on Tuesdays,。
and I get to share with people。
just how much God loves them too.。
