>> PORCH, HOW WE DOING?。
WE DOING OKAY TONIGHT?。
GREAT TO SEE YOU GUYS.。
MY GUY DOWN HERE IN THE FRONT IS HYPED.。
I LOVE IT.。
SO GOOD TO BE WITH YOU THIS EVENING.。
SPECIAL SHOUTOUT TO PORCH LIVE NATION.。
SO GLAD YOU GUYS ARE TUNING IN FROM WHEREVER IT IS YOU ARE.。
SPECIAL SHOUTOUT ESPECIALLY TO PORCH LIVE TULSA, PORCH LIVE。
SCOTTSDALE AND PORCH LIVE FRESNO.。
WE'RE SO GLAD THAT Y'ALL WOULD BE.。
WE'VE GOT SOME OF THEM IN THE HOUSE.。
HEY, IT'S GOING TO BE AN AMAZING NIGHT.。
WE'RE BACK IN OUR SERIES IN THE BOOK OF COLOSSIANS.。
BUT TO GET THINGS STARTED, I WANTED TO SHARE A QUICK STORY,。
AN OPENING ILLUSTRATION WITH YOU.。
HOW MANY OF YOU IN HERE HAVE EVER BEEN WHITE WATER RAFTING?。
ANYBODY SHOW OF HANDS?。
YEAH, SOME OF US.。
FAIR NUMBER.。
IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN WHITE WATER RAFTING, THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT。
ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE YOU STILL REMEMBER TO THIS DAY.。
I KNOW THAT'S TRUE FOR ME.。
LIKE WHEN I WENT, I CAN STILL REMEMBER IN VIVID DETAIL,。
LIKE THE ANTICIPATION OF THAT FIRST RAPID.。
OH MY GOSH, LIKE THERE IT IS.。
I REMEMBER THE INTENSITY OF OUR TEAM.。
LIKE PULL!。
LIKE WE WERE ALL ROWING IN ONE DIRECTION,。
AIMING ACCORDING TO THE COURSE OF WHAT OUR GOD WAS GIVING US.。
I REMEMBER THE CANYON WALLS.。
LIKE THEY WERE JUST SOARING UP AROUND US.。
WE FELT SO SMALL IN THE BASE OF THAT CANYON.。
AND I REMEMBER THE INTENSITY OF JUST TRYING TO NAVIGATE。
ALL OF THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THIS RAPID.。
LIKE THIS RIVER WAS WIDE AND THEN IT WAS NARROW。
AND THEN IT WAS SMOOTH AND THEN IT WAS RUSHING.。
LIKE I REMEMBER ALL OF THE STRATEGY THAT WENT INTO IT.。
I REMEMBER LIKE THE COLDNESS OF THE WATER, YOU KNOW?。
LIKE I REMEMBER EVERYTHING ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE.。
BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I REMEMBER MOST CLEARLY OF ALL?。
THE SAFETY TALK。
THAT OUR TOUR GUIDE GAVE US BEFORE WE EVER EVEN STEPPED FOOT IN THE BOAT.。
WHY?。
WHY DID I PAY SO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE SAFETY TALK?。
IT SEEMS KIND OF ODD.。
WELL, WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS IN MY BACKGROUND。
THE CLOSEST THING TO A WHITE WATER RAPID I'D EVER GOTTEN。
WAS JUST LIKE KIND OF FLOATING DOWN THE LAZY RIVER。
AT THE LOCAL WATER PARK.。
YOU KNOW LIKE I HAD NOT HAD ANY EXPERIENCE OR EXPOSURE。
TO THE GREAT OUTDOORS。
AND TO WHAT AWAITED ME IN THAT COLORADO RIVER IN SPECIFIC.。
AND SO WHEN HE WENT INTO A FULL DISSERTATION。
OF THE DANGERS THAT WE COULD EXPECT。
I PAID ATTENTION.。
LIKE I LEANED IN AND I LEARNED AS MUCH AS I COULD。
BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE。
I WAS WELL PREPARED FOR WHAT WAS OUT AHEAD OF US.。
AND SO AS HE WALKED THROUGH IT ALL。
I KNEW.。
LIKE MAN IF THE BOAT'S ABOUT TO CAPSIZE。
I WAS SUPPOSED TO THROW MY BODY WEIGHT THAT DIRECTION。
SO THAT WAY WE CAN RELEVEL THIS THING OUT.。
OR IF I FIND MYSELF FOR SOME REASON OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT。
WHICH IS REALLY NOT RECOMMENDED。
YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE YOU STAY IN THE BOAT AT ALL COSTS。
IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.。
BUT IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT。
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO。
IS YOU SHOULD MAKE LIKE MICHAEL PHELPS BABY。
AND YOU SHOULD SWIM TO WHATEVER SHORE IS CLOSEST TO YOU.。
AND IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT。
LIKE IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL。
AND THINGS ARE GETTING DICY OUT THERE。
YOU ASSUME THE PROPER POSITION。
YOU GET ON YOUR BACK。
AND YOU FLOAT WITH YOUR LEGS POINTED DOWNSTREAM。
AND YOUR KNEES SLIGHTLY BENT。
THAT WAY YOU CAN PUSH OFF OF ANY ROCKS。
YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF BUMPING UP AGAINST。
BUT YOU DON'T JUST SIT LIKE THIS。
YOU SPREAD YOUR ARMS OUT WIDE。
BECAUSE THIS IS HOW YOU NAVIGATE。
AND MANEUVER THROUGH THE WATER。
I REMEMBER ALL OF IT。
LIKE I AM SO STILL TO THIS DAY。
LIKE I HAVE SUCH CLARITY OF WHAT THAT MOMENT FELT LIKE。
WHY?。
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID。
BUT I WAS ALSO EXCITED。
I KNEW I WAS SETTING OUT INTO SOMETHING。
THAT WAS SO MEANINGFUL。
LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING。
BUT I ALSO KNEW。
BECAUSE OF THAT SAFETY TALK。
I WAS STEPPING OUT INTO SOMETHING。
THAT WAS DANGEROUS TOO。
YOU SEE MY GOD SAID IT BEST。
IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY LIFE INSIDE THE BOAT。
THEN YOU NEED TO PREPARE FOR DANGERS。
OUTSIDE THE BOAT。
WHY DO I TELL YOU THAT?。
BECAUSE THE SAME THING IS TRUE。
IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE。

This is what all of these religious observances are.。
They're really good.。
They're really beautiful.。
So what does Paul mean when he says。
they're a shadow of the things to come?。
What's he mean by that?。
Well, think about a shadow.。
What's a shadow?。
A shadow is an immaterial shape。
of a material subject.。
Y'all tracking with that?。
In my green room just a minute ago。
I was just kind of working through the rhythm of this thing, you know?。
And as I'm doing it, I looked to my left。
and my shadow is just kind of dancing along with me.。
I can see it right now. It's right here in front of me.。
This shadow has no substance in and of itself.。
But it points to that which does have substance.。
You tracking?。
That's what he's saying here.。
He's saying, "Hey, all of these Old Testament religious observances,。
every rule, every regulation that God gave,。
they were never the point.。
But they were pointing to the point."。
It's like this.。
In the Old Testament, they would sacrifice。
perfect, spotless lamb。
because it was through the sacrifice of that lamb。
that they would receive forgiveness for their sins.。
That was a shadow of the substance, which is Jesus Christ,。
the Lamb of God,。
which has come to take away all the sins of the world.。
We don't have to repeatedly sacrifice any longer。
because His sacrifice was enough,。
fully and finally sufficient forever.。
Sabbath.。
God instituted a day where we would take time。
and we would rest in His goodness.。
We would rest from any work in which we would do.。
But in Christ, we see the fullness of that.。
That He has become our rest.。
That we don't have to earn and work and strive and strain。
and sweat by the toil of our brow any longer.。
We can rest in the fact。
that everything He's done,。
all the work He's performed, it's enough.。
We don't have to strive any longer.。
Do you see it?。
All of these things, they're shadows of the substance.。
Jesus is the one that all of it's pointing to.。
He has come and He has fulfilled every letter of the law.。
And so guess what?。
We don't need to pay attention to them.。
We need to pay attention to Him.。
That's what Paul's pointing to.。
That's what he's saying.。
He's looking at me saying,。
"Hey, there's a bunch of people around you。
"and there's a bunch of things you should do."。
And he's like, "Don't do those things."。
Because Christ already did them.。
He already completed them.。
He already accomplished them.。
You don't need to pay attention to them any longer.。
You need to pay attention to Him.。
That's why he's saying,。
"Hey, don't indulge the shadow amidst the substance."。
It would kind of be like this.。
Say it's date night at the Perry house.。
And your boy, he's got plans, all right?。
Like I've decided to work up like a three-course menu.。
I'm working in the kitchen all day.。
I bought fresh flowers.。
I lit some candles.。
I made sure the place was picked up and cleaned for my bride.。
And then she walks in the door。
and she sits down to dine and delight.。
And I look at her and say, "What are you doing?。
"That seat's not for you."。
And I go and I grab a picture of her。
and I set it across from me.。
This is what it's about.。
That would be crazy.。
That would feel so ludicrous.。
And yet, that's the point Paul's making.。
That's the kind of thinking he's exposing.。
He's looking at them and he's saying,。
"Hey, do not let anyone illegitimize your faith。
"because you're not following a bunch of。
"unnecessary regulations."。
Like you don't value the picture.。
You value the subject, right?。
It's not about what's in the frame.。
It's about the one whom the frame depicts.。
He says it like this in a different verse.。
He says in Galatians 3, 3, "Are you so foolish?。
"Having begun by the spirit,。
"are you now being perfected by the flesh?"。
What's he getting at?。
It is impossible, it is impossible。
to perfect yourself by your own strength.。
Say impossible with me.。
Impossible.。
It's impossible, do you get it?。
It is impossible to perfect yourself by your own strength.。
Like we don't deepen our spirituality。
with a can-do attitude。
and by giving it the good college try.。
That's not how you grow.。
You grow by loving him.。
That's how it happens.。
Like all the religious observance。
that he's speaking to here,。
any obedience you feel the need to adhere to,。
it is a response from your love for God.。
Not an action you're working up。
to earn his favor,。
to merit his approval.。
And yet here's what's so fascinating.。
This is such a prevalent issue in the church today.。
And well beyond the walls of this place,。
it's a prevalent issue in the world today.。
But what I think is crazy is the fact that。
if you look around and you observe what ministers are saying,。
this is nothing new.。
Like people today are prescribing。
a variety of steps you should take。
or they're peddling some solution you should adopt。
so that way you can become like Jesus.。
So they look at you and they say things like,。
"Hey, here's how to kill porn.。
"Here's how to overcome your laziness.。
"Here's how to live a stress-free life.。
"Here's six steps to make sure you're never lazy again."。
They start prescribing all of these steps,。
all of these how-tos,。
all of these lists of to-dos,。
so that way you'll adhere to them。
and you'll buy into the promise,。
"This is going to make me like Jesus."。
And yet what happens is you've only signed up。
for another religious observance.。
Your effort doesn't make you like Him.。
Your love for Him。
and desire to walk with Him and be with Him in due time。
will make you like Him.。
You see, here's what's fascinating about this idea,。
that we can merit our Christlikeness.。
We can kind of grit and bear our way into becoming like Him.。
The interesting thing about it。
is it ultimately just leaves us with something to brag about.。
That's all it does.。
Like, man, I've never missed a Sunday service.。
I'm always the one that speaks up in community group.。
Every time we go around and we confess sin,。
I confess three.。
We think that doing all of these things。
makes us more like Jesus,。
and yet here is the issue.。
If it all depends upon you,。
what ends up happening is it either leads to your pride,。
because, boy, you did it.。
You kept all six steps,。
or it leads to your despair。
because you can't do it.。
Jesus is trying to free us from that,。
and that's what Paul is advocating for in this section.。
He's saying, "Hey, don't subscribe to a self-help gospel。
that God helps those who help themselves,"。
which sounds right.。
Like, man, yeah, I think God is going to help me。
if I do help myself, but here's the thing, porch.。
God does not help those who help themselves.。
He helps those that cannot help themselves.。
That's the nature of the gospel.。
God looks upon people, and He says,。
"No, you can't do it, but I can do it,。
so you cling fast to me.。
You stay connected to me,。
and as we walk together, you know what's going to happen?。
You're going to become like me,。
but you stay close. You hold fast."。
Now, am I looking at you and saying, "Man, you know what?。
Yeah, so you should just indulge in revelry。
and be completely disobedient.。
You should never try a day in your life."。
No, like that's not the point of all of this.。
Again, I just said it a minute ago.。
Obedience is a response to the one we love.。
I love you, God, so let me live my life.。
My identity is in Christ.。
Now, look at my activity, which reflects His own.。
I don't obey so that way I can become like Him.。
That's not how this thing works.。
Paul says it like this in Philippians 2, 12 and 13.。
He says, "Therefore, my beloved,。
as you have always obeyed, so now,。
not only in my presence, but much more in my absence,。
work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."。
Do you feel the sense of responsibility on your life for that?。
Like, work it out, baby. Like, get after it.。
You've got a sense of duty here,。
and yet catch what it says in 13,。
'cause you can never divorce these verses from each other.。
"For it is God who works in you,。
both to will and to work for His good pleasure."。
We have a role to play, no doubt.。
But here's the point I need you to take away.。
If the influential voices in your life,。
whoever it is you listen to,。
if all they ever do is prescribe behavior。
and they never provoke the heart,。
stop listening to them.。
That is not the gospel.。
The gospel is not, "Hey, He needs your help."。
The gospel is, "You couldn't help yourself,。
so He stepped down from heaven to help you in every way。
you did not deserve."。
This is the first threat that Paul's warning us away from.。
He wants us to know, man,。
it doesn't matter how good, wise, or well-meaning the advice is.。
It doesn't matter how much you love that pastor,。
but specific rhythms that podcast is recommending,。
you become like Christ by beholding Christ.。
But that's not the only thing.。
It's not only that we don't grow through religious observances.。
As Paul keeps going, he's going to tell us。
that we also do not grow by way of mystical experiences.。
So read this with me. It's in verse 18.。
He says, "Let no one disqualify you。
insisting on asceticism and worship of angels,。
going on in detail about visions,。
puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind,。
and not holding fast to the head,。
from whom the whole body, the whole body,。
nourished and knit together through its joints。
and its ligaments, grows with a growth that is of God."。
As Paul keeps going, we get to verse 18.。
He shifts his warning away from focusing on religious activity。
to focusing very specifically on mystical sensitivity,。
which actually reflects the spiritual spectrum。
of our current context.。
I did a lot of research.。
I actually had it all built out in here.。
We just don't have time to walk all the way through it.。
But if you go and you look at the national surveys,。
who do you think composes the group。
that is most predominantly considered。
spiritual but not religious?。
Who do you think it is? I'll give you one guess.。
You.。
It's the 20 and 30-somethings of our world.。
It's those that are your age.。
It's those that are here in this room.。
They are you.。
You are the ones that would say, "I'm spiritual.。
I have an interest in spirituality.。
Sure, I have a decreasing interest in religiosity,。
but I am very open to spirituality,"。
which gives a lot of explanation for the eruption。
of things like crystals and angel numbers。
and manifestation and the law of self-attraction, right?。
And the idea of like the rebirth of Ouija boards。
and tarot cards and horoscopes,。
the rise of seances and spiritualism.。
These things, they are making their way back。
to the center of society, into the mainstream of our world.。
I was reading a national publication。
that is revered for representing the interests。
of young adults, and it was saying, yeah,。
young adults today, the young people of America,。
they have a belief in a higher power,。
a stronger desire to be engaged with the supernatural。
and an interest in personal spiritual experience。
that transcends decades and times past.。
And so Paul's looking at you, and he's saying,。
"Hey, the issues of this room。
look a lot like the issues of this room."。
The things that we feel, the pressures we face,。
the desires we have, man,。
I want to be a part of something transcendent.。
It's really not all that different。
from what the believers in Colossae were confronted with.。
And yet it's interesting as you read through this,。
just to add to the similarities between what they're facing。
and what we're facing, is there's this idea of syncretism,。
right, where I take a blend。
of all of the different religious influences,。
spiritual influences that I like,。
that I admire, that I prefer,。
and I just kind of mix them together。
and I accept them as my own.。
Like, that's what's weird about this passage.。
When you read through it, it's like, man, Paul,。
what are you talking about?。
You're talking about legalism,。
you're talking about asceticism,。
you're talking about spiritualism, moralism.。
Where does it end?。
Like, there's so many different philosophies,。
and that's the point.。
They are looking at a massive, a massive spiritual interest,。
the likes of which we can relate.。
And so Paul looks at them and he says,。
"Hey, you need to beware。
"of seeking a spiritual feeling instead of Christ.。
"You need to beware of seeking a spiritual feeling。
"instead of Christ."。
He tells these Colossian Christians to be careful。
of people who delight in asceticism。
and the worship of angels.。
What does that even mean?。
Well, asceticism is the idea that I attain spirituality。
by way of self-denial.。
And the worship of angels is like on the other end。
of the spectrum from that,。
that it's not an issue of self-denial,。
but it's a desire for self-enlightenment,。
that there are a series of inferior spiritual beings。
that all descend from God above,。
that if I worship them, if I engage with them,。
if I interact with them,。
what happens is I get the chance。
to spiritually enlighten myself.。
I get to reach and touch something that is supernatural。
and otherworldly to my regular experience.。
That's why Paul's confronting it.。
You see, these people, they're looking,。
they're looking at Jesus and they're saying。
to this young group of people,。
"He's fine.。
"Jesus is great,。
"but we're a syncretistic bunch.。
"You should add some things onto him.。
"He's not sufficient in and of himself.。
"You probably need to mix and match。
"a couple of other philosophies that'll help you。
"to actually feel everything you were wanting for。
"because we know, man, sometimes he kind of lets you down.。
"You know, it's just sometimes the day's really good。
"and sometimes the day's really hard.。
"Sometimes he feels really close。
"and sometimes he feels really far.。
"And so what you should do is you should just add some stuff.。
"You should pile on some more spirituality.。
"And what's going to happen is you're going to feel。
"more transcendent, more spiritually enlightened,。
"more inclined to the Godheads."。
Like, they're promoting an idea that I remember facing。
whenever I went to buy my wife and I's new car recently.。
Like, I showed up and I knew exactly what I wanted.。
I knew what I needed to take me from point A to point B.。
Like, whenever I, like, get my eyes set on something,。
I've got a job to do, like, I'm pretty obsessive.。
Like, I do a ton of research.。
And so I made sure, like, I looked at all the comps。
in the surrounding area.。
I made sure that I had checked the make and the model.。
I knew the styles and the trims that I wanted in specific.。
I understood the gas mileage and knew, man,。
this is the right car for me.。
And so I showed up and after test driving it。
and visiting with the salesman a little bit。
and feeling like the guy was on my side。
because that's just his job, I ended up sitting down。
and saying, "Let's do it, man. Let's close the deal."。
And so I knew exactly the price that I had walked into。
and yet he slides across the vehicle invoice。
and that price does not match at all what I'd shown up for.。
Why?。
Because he put a bunch of add-ons to the thing.。
He looked at my car and he said, "Man, it's great,。
"but it's just not enough.。
"You know what you need? You need a windshield repair kit.。
"That's what you need because you're going to catch a rock man。
"on the way home and you're going to be so upset。
"you didn't get this. I already put it on there for you, brother.。
"I took care of it.。
"You also, you're going to want that Primo wax。
"that I love to put on all my clients' cars.。
"I added that in there for you, just common courtesy."。
You know, like he just walked through these。
and I was like, "Man, I don't need any of this stuff.。
"This stuff does not enrich my experience of the car.。
"It's just an add-on.。
"It's just a supplemental improvement。
"that does not improve anything at all."。
In the same way Paul is saying to these young believers in Colossae,。
"I mean, it's all the add-ons。
"that everybody wants to add on to Jesus."。
He's saying he's sufficient.。
He's enough.。
You don't need to add anything to him.。
You don't need to supersize your spirituality。
through a bunch of spiritual experiences.。
That's not what you need to do to feel intensely connected to God.。
There's no secret knowledge you need to learn,。
no mystery you need to uncover。
to find a deeper intimacy with God.。
Listen to me.。
You want intimacy with God?。
It's not hard to find.。
It's so much simpler than we think.。
I remember a couple years ago,。
I preached a message similar to this.。
I came down front.。
The joy of preaching appears。
I get to visit with you down there.。
And so I was standing on the floor following service。
and a young lady came up to me。
and I was anticipating what her question might be.。
Like I'm very comfortable with the fact。
that most people will come down。
and they have a circumstantial issue.。
And so they just want biblical guidance。
on how to navigate through that.。
Man, what's God's will for my job?。
Or how do I navigate this struggling relationship?。
Or whatever it may be, overcome this sin?。
And so I'm standing there,。
I'm totally expecting that that's what she's gonna do.。
She's gonna come down,。
she's gonna ask me one of those questions.。
But it's not at all what she did.。
She just came up to me and she was like,。
"How do I get what you have?"。
Like, you love God.。
I can see it.。
Like how do I get that?。
I want that.。
Now I don't normally make myself the point。
or topic of any example.。
I get far more unimpressive with time.。
Just stick around long enough and you'll see it.。
But I point to it tonight。
because she didn't come to me asking for some formula。
she needed to complete to find intimacy with Jesus.。
That's not what she was doing.。
She came asking what simple steps she needed to take.。
And what I was delighted to tell her。
is it's rather underwhelming.。
You pray.。
You pray not to get things from God。
but because you get God when you do it.。
You read.。
You read his word not because you want to accrue。
a bunch of head knowledge。
but because you want to hear the words。
of the one whom you love.。
You spend time with him.。
And not just a fleeting moment or a passing prayer。
while you're driving in the car.。
You take time and you walk with him。
and you listen to him and you speak with him.。
And what you'll find through these very simple steps。
is intimacy.。
And I just love that.。
I love that God wants to be intimate.。
Wants to be connected with you and me so bad。
that he's like, "I'm going to make it so simple。
they can't mess it up.。
I'm going to put it on the bottom shelf."。
It's not that they've got to learn some secret knowledge。
or ascribe to some elitist formula of spirituality.。
No, you don't need any of that stuff.。
What you need is just to spend time with me.。
That's what he's saying.。
How do you get close to anybody?。
You spend time with them.。
[pop]。
[laughter]。
That's what he's saying.。
He's saying spend time.。
That's what he's wanting for.。
And that's why Paul is saying, "Hey,。
if you want to come close to God,。
it's not by spiritually ascending.。
It's by seeing the fact that he's spiritually descended."。
Why? To get to you.。
Now listen, I'm not saying that Christians don't engage。
in spiritual realities or experience.。
That's not what I'm saying at all.。
I hope you do not hear that.。
I have said from this platform myself,。
I pray that God gives you transcendent touches。
here on Tuesday nights.。
Because that's what he'll do.。
Like you'll walk in this room and then one night,。
it's just going to come.。
Like the roof is going to blow off the building for you.。
It's going to be like a Tuesday that you've never before seen.。
It's going to be crazy.。
And yet you're going to come back on another Tuesday。
and it's just going to feel like a Tuesday.。
Why? Because growth isn't always about the burning bush moment.。
It's also about the mundane moments in between.。
Like Moses grew not just because he came face to face with God。
at the bush, at the pillar of fire,。
at the parting of the Red Sea.。
No, he grew with God by way of wandering in the wilderness。
for 40 years and learning to shepherd sheep.。
Some of you deeply want to grow.。
The mundanity of your spirituality,。
it can be richer, it can be hotter.。
But don't let it discourage you.。
God's working in the waiting.。
He's working in the mundane.。
He's wanting to meet with you at all times and in all ways.。
How do you spot a spiritual fraud?。
1 John 4, 1 through 3 tells us.。
It says, "Beloved, do not believe every spirit,。
but test the spirits to see whether they are from God.。
For many false prophets have gone out into the world.。
By this you know the spirit of God.。
Every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has come in the flesh。
is from God."。
Catch that.。
Every spirit that confesses Jesus has come in the flesh。
is from God.。
And every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.。
How do you tell if someone or something is spiritually fraudulent?。
When the emphasis moves away from the simplicity of knowing Christ.。
It's all about Him, man.。
And when the emphasis ever becomes about anything else,。
you get as far away from that as possible.。
And this is the reality, man.。
I fear in our desire and desperation to be connected to something that feels real.。
That feels spiritual.。
We have in fact gotten connected to things that do feel real and do feel spiritual.。
But are not good.。
We have given ourselves over to things that fall within the list I said earlier.。
I said, you know what, I can have this crystal.。
I can manifest this idea.。
I can indulge these other spiritual curiosities and walk with Jesus.。
No.。
Paul is decrying that reality.。
If you want inclined spiritual experience,。
why would you look anywhere else than the man that is the fullness of the deity?。
Like all the fullness of God dwells in Jesus.。
If you want something transcendent, then get intimate with him.。
Because he will lead you to it.。
Final point.。
Pick it up in verse 20.。
If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why,。
as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations?。
Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch.。
That feels a lot like religion, right?。
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.。
Referring to things that all perish as they are used,。
according to human precepts and teachings.。
These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion。
and asceticism and severity of the body,。
but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.。
As Paul moves into the final few verses of this chapter,。
he picks up an idea that he addressed earlier on,。
but we didn't really unpack in full detail.。
He comes back to this idea of asceticism.。
Earlier I said that asceticism is the teaching that you spiritually attain。
by way of self-denial.。
And yet here's what's interesting.。
Like Paul is, he's going to talk about, yeah, you know,。
like self-denial in this context is bad,。
but self-denial in every context isn't always bad.。
Like if you look throughout the Bible,。
there are multiple examples of ascetic practices, of self-denial,。
things like fasting and abstinence and celibacy,。
that people are, that people ultimately adopt。
for the sake of growing closer to God.。
You can look at the words of Jesus himself.。
He says in Luke 9, 23, "And he said to all,。
'If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself。
and take up his cross daily and follow me.'"。
Let him deny himself.。
Is self-denial intrinsically bad?。
Is asceticism inherently wrong?。
No, it's not.。
But here's the thing.。
The act of self-denial is not intrinsically wrong,。
but what can be wrong is the motive behind your self-denial.。
That's what can be wrong.。
Which feels kind of like, yeah, man, of course.。
Like it's always about motives.。
It's always about my heart.。
But here's what we need to grab hold of,。
because I think that this is where the point really stands out.。
If you look at the word asceticism in the original language,。
it's a weird word,。
because the word actually just means humility,。
which we hear, and we're like, "That's a really good thing, man.。
I'm supposed to be humble."。
God gives favor to the humble.。
He gives grace to them.。
And yet in this context, as you read through this,。
through these verses,。
what Paul's unpacking is not the idea of pure humility,。
but impure humility.。
He's unpacking this idea of false humility.。
For the Colossians, asceticism is synonymous with false humility.。
What's false humility?。
False humility is pride in disguise.。
It's pride in disguise.。
I'm going to make myself look low.。
I'm going to sound like I don't know.。
And yet in the process of doing these things,。
they're going to think I'm awesome.。
Like one of my friends, he was saying earlier,。
it's as if Jordan walked in and said,。
"Man, I'm no good at basketball."。
It's like, "Shut up, Jordan.。
You're amazing at basketball."。
That would be false humility.。
He would be saying something that is not true.。
Why? Because he's baiting compliments.。
That's what Paul's pointing at here in this chapter.。
He's saying, "Hey, you need to beware。
of seeking an impressive appearance instead of Christ.。
You need to beware of seeking an impressive appearance。
instead of Christ."。
When he says, "Hey, when you submit to regulations。
that have the appearance of wisdom。
and promoting self-made religion and asceticism。
and severity to the body, they have no value."。
Like when you promote your own self-made godliness,。
your false humility,。
when you make yourself look low like Christ,。
but simply so you can receive acclaim。
and accolade and approval,。
there's no value in that.。
That has no worth whatsoever.。
Which, Porch, if I can just deal honestly with you。
for a second, for those of you in the room。
that do know Jesus,。
this is a problem that is especially prevalent。
in our culture today, because what we know。
is that people have bought full-heartedly。
into the commodification of Christ。
and viral posturing for the sake of approval,。
all on the basis of Jesus' name.。
You see it.。
Just pull up Instagram right now.。
You can see someone with lights, camera, action,。
making sure that people look in and say,。
"Golly, I wish I was godly like them."。
And yet the truth of the matter is,。
that's false humility, not in every sense,。
but it certainly can be,。
that people will prop themselves up。
on the foundation of Jesus Christ's name,。
Jesus Christ's ministry,。
simply for the hope that you will follow them。
more so than you'll follow him.。
I am begging you,。
do not be a life that follows in that vein.。
That's what Paul is drilling home.。
He's saying, "Hey, don't aspire to look。
"like your favorite Christian influencer."。
You don't need to always speak in quotable captions。
and strategic sound bites.。
He says in 1 Timothy 6, 7,。
"Ask for the rich in the present age."。
The rich, those that have everything they want.。
"Charge them not to be haughty,。
"nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches,。
"but on God who richly provides us。
"with everything to enjoy."。
It's not in riches, it's not in acclaim,。
it's not through approval,。
it's not by recognition that you enjoy, it's by God.。
God is the source of all joy.。
And listen, I know that feels especially specific。
to the believer, but for the unbeliever here,。
if you don't know Jesus,。
if you're still trying to figure this all out,。
Paul is pleading with you too,。
to not just stand on the right side of history。
and agree to today's truth,。
but to align with the author of all history。
and follow his objective truth.。
That's what Paul is arguing for your sake.。
He's saying, "Hey man, God has everything you want and more,。
"everything you've longed for,。
"everything you've angled to get,。
"He's the one that has it, so you come to Him."。
Paul, I'm sorry, Jesus says in the gospel of John,。
He says to the Jews who had believed in Him,。
"If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples。
"and you'll know the truth and the truth will set you free."。
You see the truth of Jesus Christ。
is the one that sets us free.。
Believer, non-believer, it's the one that sets us free.。
Free from being enough for people,。
free from feeling the need to position myself。
or posture my life so people will look at it and say,。
"Hey, that looks awesome, man, how do I get like that?"。
Free from any need to hold up the mask。
and hide behind it any longer,。
like Jesus is the one that sets you free from all of it.。
I just wish we would believe it.。
I wish we would believe the fact。
that He is the one that has come to set us free.。
Free from sin, yes.。
Free from slavery and bondage of those things。
which we know we should not do yet we have done anyways。
and are in absolute and utter rebellion to God.。
He has come to free us from that,。
but He hasn't just come to free us from our sin,。
He has come to free us to new life,。
to a new future, to a new hope, to a new glory.。
How do we know that that's the case?。
How do we know that Jesus has set us free。
from anything that would threaten our identity in Him?。
Because Jesus Christ,。
He did every moral activity you and I could not do.。
He was perfect in our place.。
He lived absolutely perfectly on your behalf.。
But not only that, Jesus Christ, the fullness of God,。
become man.。
He has brought in full a spiritual experience。
the likes of which you will find nowhere else.。
He says, "I know that you want for something deep。
"and meaningful and rich, and I've come to give it to you."。
But not only that, Jesus,。
He did not concern Himself with an impressive appearance.。
Instead, He took on our likeness,。
humbled Himself by becoming like one of us。
for the very purpose of living, dying, rising,。
that you might have an appearance the likes of which。
you wouldn't dare dream find.。
One that is so impressive。
that the world will look upon and not say,。
"Man, you're awesome,"。
but will look to Him and say, "He is awesome."。
This is the gospel.。
Christ has come to set you free from every threat。
by enduring your threat。
that you might be with Him where He is forever.。
Do you believe Him?。
Do you know Him?。
Then walk with Him, trust in Him,。
and He will make you like Himself in due time.。
Let me pray for us.。
Father,。
God, there are so many。
traps and temptations in this world,。
so many things, God, which seek to。
dissuade us from walking with You,。
lead us to seek satisfaction elsewhere.。
And yet, God, tonight we're reminded of the reality that。
true love, deep joy,。
and uninhibited freedom。
is found in You and You alone.。
And because, God, this truth still remains true,。
and it reigns over us tonight by Your Son, Jesus Christ,。
we can take such courage in heart。
that though, God, in this world we will have trouble,。
we can take heart, for You have overcome it,。
and, God, we will be with You where You are one day.。
Lord, I know that there are people in this room tonight。
that don't know You,。
and yet, God, they've walked in tonight,。
and they've asked questions。
that, God, I myself have asked in times past.。
Why is life so hard?。
What's all this about?。
What even is my purpose?。
And I pray, God, they would know that。
You are the one that has the answers to these things,。
and those answers, God,。
they're better than they could ever imagine.。
For the believer in the room, God,。
there are many of us here that,。
man, we have fallen prey to some of the dangers。
we've talked about tonight, God.。
We have absolutely fallen prey to legalism,。
religious observance, God,。
just doing the right thing。
and hoping to get good out of it,。
trusting, God, that that's gonna make me like Jesus.。
Lord, that's not gonna make us like Jesus.。
It's Jesus that makes us like Jesus.。
Sure, we gotta work out our salvation with fear and trembling.。
We've gotta come along and be a part of the process,。
but we can trust in You, God,。
to complete the work that You've already begun.。
Others of us, it's not moral activity.。
It's spiritual sensitivity, God.。
We want an experience.。
I pray, God, that we would know。
in You is all the fullness we could ever seek,。
that Jesus, You are the image of the invisible God,。
and so we need seek transcendence nowhere else but in You.。
For others, God, we feel this need to be impressive,。
to put up a front,。
to make sure, God, that we impress and appeal to people,。
and yet, God, we can know。
that we don't need to pursue impressive appearance,。
for You, Jesus, have given us a likeness to that of Yourself.。
God, would You work amongst us?。
Would You have Your way in this space?。
Would You lead us to take the next step, we pray.。
It's in Jesus' holy name, amen.。
Amen.。
