[Music]。
You carried my burdens and hung on that tree。
With every breath You thought of me。
Without Your mercy where would I be?。
Where would I be without You?。
All of my sorrows were met with Your grief。
In suffering and dying You gave me the keys。
Without Your cross where would I be?。
Where would I be without You?。
Hallelujah, You came to set me free。
Hallelujah, You ran to welcome me。
The story isn't over, it's only just begun。
You've written every word in perfect love。
Hallelujah, sing hallelujah。
Sing hallelujah。
You silenced the curse of my enemies。
And rose up in power, my King of all kings。
Without Your victory where would I be?。
Where would I be without You?。
Hallelujah, You came to set me free。
Hallelujah, You ran to welcome me。
The story isn't over, it's only just begun。
You've written every word in perfect love。
Hallelujah, sing hallelujah。
Sing hallelujah。
I was an orphan left on the street。
Died of beating, broken and weak。
You knew my history, all of my sin。
With open arms You welcomed me in。
I was an orphan left on the street。
Died of beating, broken and weak。
You knew my history, all of my sin。
With open arms You welcomed me in。
Hallelujah, You came to set me free。
Hallelujah, You ran to welcome me。
The story isn't over, it's only just begun。
You've written every word in perfect love。
Hallelujah, sing hallelujah。
I was an orphan left on the street。
Tattered and beaten, broken and weak。
You knew my history, all of my sin。
With open arms You welcomed me in。
Oh, You welcomed me in。
Yes You did Lord。
Cause I was lost and opened。
But You welcomed me in。
There's nowhere I could go from this feeling。
You welcomed me in。
Hallelujah, sing hallelujah。
