[Music]。
Hey, welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth,。
Fayetteville, Austin, Texas, Houston, Texas, Cedar Rapids,。
Iowa, El Paso, Fort Worth, Boise, Idaho, and all the Ports。
and all the Ports, live locations, everybody tuning in。
online.。
We are doing something special tonight.。
Let me start us off by telling a story that happened this past。
week that will give us direction for where we are going to go.。
There is something that has come on the scene, I don't know if。
it's the past two years, five years, or just I missed it for。
like a decade and it's been here for a while.。
It's called an escape room.。
Anyone familiar with an escape room?。
This is a thing.。
If you are not familiar, it's basically you pay somebody $200。
to lock you in a closet and figure out how to get out of。
there.。
And they are making a killing off of this thing.。
It's a team bonding experience.。
This past week we went to an escape room, Escapeology, in。
the heart of Dallas.。
Went in there and given the instructions on our room.。
And we go into this room.。
If you have never been in one, you have to figure out how to。
break -- you have to figure out the mystery.。
I really should have thought this through.。
I was going to explain it.。
You have to think through how to get out.。
You have to follow certain clues and read and diagram in order to。
solve the mystery.。
Ours was a murder mystery.。
You have to solve who murdered the person in order to get the。
eventual code that allows you out of the room.。
But there's all these different turns and things that are。
involved in trying to figure out the story.。
So it's you and five people.。
You have one hour to make it happen.。
And you're trying to get it done.。
This was the most challenging escape room I have ever even。
heard of.。
Whoever came up with this thing intentionally made it to where。
it would be impossible to get out of there without asking for。
clues or asking for help.。
In other words, in the escape room, you can hit a button at。
any time and say, hey, we're stuck.。
Give us some way of getting out of here.。
Give us the next clue.。
Because we can't make the next thing.。
And this one was so challenging.。
I was insulted by the clues they would give.。
Turn this thing around.。
There's Braille in the background.。
You want to figure out how to read Hebrew.。
And walk through it.。
And you thought we were going to get here on our own by doing。
this.。
Every single time it was designed to where without help from the。
outside you were not getting out.。
And you thought, what does that have to do with what we are。
talking about tonight.。
We are in a season of life, just in general as our country and。
really for the last number of months where a lot of us have。
felt like in life we are stuck.。
We're covered in anxiety.。
The rates of suicide.。
I was reading it before and talking with a friend.。
One in four young adults in the last 90 days have contemplated。
suicide.。
Things have gotten so bad and so overwhelmed and so anxious.。
They thought about ending their life.。
One in four.。
Think about that.。
Antidepressants are up 600% since COVID hit.。
The number of young adults before COVID who were。
experiencing anxiety was through the roof and now it's just。
exploded.。
And all of us coming to the room with different degrees to the。
level of which we are feeling anxious, uncertain, overwhelmed.。
And we're stuck in our head.。
And what I want to do for the next handful of minutes is talk。
through what it looks like to conquer some of that anxiety and。
those anxious and fearful thoughts and conquer the toxic。
thinking.。
Because so often people will -- in attempting to help people。
get unstuck from overwhelmed and trapped in my head and sad and。
battling depression.。
People come along and well-meaning and give messages,。
and positive things.。
Sometimes pastors who go into a self-help mode.。
While it may feel good in the moment, it doesn't lead to。
transformation.。
And it makes me think no weapon formed against me will stand.。
I will conquer this and get the job and not get sick and。
everything is perfect.。
And then it doesn't happen.。
And those truths were never helpful and didn't help me get。
out of the room.。
And I'm going to do something positive.。
But what if there was a way to get help from the outside?。
And by that I don't mean a specific speaker myself or a。
friend I'm about to bring up.。
I mean from God's word on the clues of how to conquer and work。
through and get out of some of the toxic anxious thinking and。
feelings that mark our lives.。
The good news is the Bible says that there is a way.。
And it doesn't come from self-help or positive thinking.。
It comes from the truth contained in God's word.。
And what I want to do in a few minutes is walk through a。
crucial topic with a gifted friend and minister who has。
devoted the last 18 months or long amount of time studying。
what it looks like and how all the ways that our toxic thinking。
God's word really does give us the clues to help break out and。
experience freedom from some of the anxiety.。
My guess is if you came in the room and I said, hey, if you hit。
this, most people would hit it.。
And it may not be that simple but it is clear in God's word,。
he gives us paths that we can choose to get on and choose to。
battle against anxious fearful thinking.。
So I'm going to bring up a friend, her name is Jenny Allen.。
She wrote a book called Get Out of Your Head.。
And Jenny, as she gets up here, let me tell you about Jenny.。
If you are not familiar with Jenny, she leads an organization。
that helps hundreds of thousands of women around the country.。
She's a New York Times best-selling author and a mom of。
four and a tremendously gifted minister and a gift to our body.。
And a member of Watermark.。
And every now and then you run into people, man, the spirit of。
God is at work through them.。
And Jenny is someone that every time I'm around her, I sense。
that and see that and constantly encouraged.。
She wrote a book called Get Out of Your Head and I asked her,。
what is it that you can do to help us talk through.。
Because you put into word form practically how God's word helps。
us and why it's so important that we get out of our head.。
Welcome to the stage, Jenny Allen.。
[Applause]。
Thank you, David.。
Come on.。
Great to be here, guys.。
How you doing?。
Yeah.。
So Jenny wrote a book, man, I left it down there.。
Get Out of Your Head.。
Jenny has written a number of books and been a part of。
Watermark.。
And I mean everything that I said, Jenny, such a gift to the。
church and generation.。
If you don't know about if gathering and you're a girl,。
for girls, you need to know about if gathering.。
Check that out, I think in March or at some point.。
I read through this two different times and so encouraged。
by it.。
Because this generation in particular, everybody right now。
is stuck in our head, feeling anxious.。
There's uncertainty.。
And no, I don't think uncertainty is increased.。
Because we all live in 100% uncertainty every single day.。
Like everything is uncertain.。
Whether, you know, we realized it or not, COVID has made things。
feel and the climate has made it feel uncertain.。
So just wanted to launch into this conversation and talk up。
to you, what made you decide to write this book and open into。
the conversation of anxiety.。
And why is -- in the book you call it the battle, the most。
important battle of this generation is taking place in。
the mind.。
Most people don't realize it.。
But it is shaping your future, it's shaping your life.。
It's shaping who you're going to marry, who you're becoming.。
It's shaping all of your life right now.。
So just why is that so important?。
Why would you say that?。
And what made you passionate about it?。
Yeah, well, you know, this is the thing.。
This is so random.。
I'm going to start with a really interesting funny story.。
So one of my friends sent me an article in Cosmo where they。
talked about my book.。
Which is really interesting because it's very Jesus.。
In fact I have a whole portion about it not being self-help.。
It's interesting that Cosmo shared my book.。
And what they said is, it's like Jenny Allen knew that you know。
what was going to hit the fan.。
This Christian book is in Cosmo with a cuss word about it.。
And I think the funny thing is, I didn't.。
But God did.。
Like God knew that this book would come out two months before。
COVID hit.。
And I can't explain that.。
There's no way I could ever, you know, make this happen in life.。
You just know that there is a God that cares about people.。
Because this topic, it wasn't even the book I was supposed to。
write.。
I shifted gears two years before and went to work and put my head。
down on this book.。
And put another book that I was almost done with to the side.。
And so God knew the timing was going to matter.。
And I start with that story because the timing matters.。
And what he just said is exactly right.。
What happened is the lake drained.。
And we all saw it was at the bottom of our lakes.。
And what was at the bottom of our lakes was a lot of mess.。
And so I think it's not new stuff.。
I think it was already there.。
But I do think that what we found was, wow, I have been。
anxious probably for a long time.。
I may have been busy enough that I didn't notice.。
Or I have been depressed for a long time.。
And we're starting to even consider maybe I need to get。
some help.。
I think that's what is powerful about COVID.。
What you said was so right, David.。
I don't think we found ourselves in a unique moment that has。
produced a lot of anxiety.。
I think we found ourselves in a moment that revealed the anxiety。
we already felt.。
Why did you write it?。
I know you have a lot of things on your mind.。
What shifted or led you down that journey?。
I know you talk about doubt and that wrestle.。
And I think that's part of the reason.。
How would you say?。
Two things.。
One, my daughter Kate is 18 years old.。
She's a freshman at A&M.。
And for five years -- yeah.。
For five years, I'm a razor bat.。
[Laughter]。
Just throw that in there.。
I'm a razor bat.。
It's hard, y'all.。
I got two Aggies.。
What did I do?。
God's people, man.。
Anyway.。
So my daughter is in seventh grade and she gets this passion。
and heart for neuroscience.。
And she starts reading and watching Ted Talks on it.。
And so I start doing this with her.。
And it's so interesting.。
Because when I started doing the science work on this book, I。
thought it was going to be in opposition to the Bible.。
But it actually completely revealed what the Bible says is。
true.。
That our brains can change.。
That our brains physically are changing based on what we think。
about.。
So our chemistry, our body is very connected to the brain that。
God built.。
That's not surprising to Christians.。
Right?。
Christians know that God built all of this to work together and。
for others good and for his glory.。
And so when something is broken in our mind, it begins to affect。
every part of us.。
And I think that's where I started to get so passionate.。
I minister to women and I talk about emotions.。
My first Bible study was stuck and walks through the emotions。
we face.。
But I didn't see our side of the church really talking about the。
mind.。
And about how we could shift it.。
And yet everything I was reading in science and psychiatry and。
all of these things were absolutely echoing what the。
Bible says.。
They just completely fell short.。
And I was like, I don't know how to introduce this.。
They would end the book.。
It would be biblical in the sense that you can change your。
brain and your brain can change.。
And towards the end it would say, so what you need to do is。
think positive thoughts about yourself.。
That you are awesome.。
And all of these positive self-esteem things.。
And I was thinking, well, I just am not.。
So I don't exactly know like how that's supposed to help.。
If I don't feel awesome about myself.。
Am I just supposed to tell myself that I'm worth something?。
And so I think watching my daughter for five years, five。
years she was pursuing this.。
I saw and read a lot and I realized the church is afraid of。
this topic and yet it is absolutely biblical.。
So that was the first thing.。
The second thing that happened was I went through a season of。
doubt for 18 months.。
Following a crazy story that it was just dark.。
And so I entered into this season of just wrestling with my。
faith.。
And for 18 months I woke up in the middle of the night and。
asked myself, is this true?。
Does it fade to black?。
Why are you wasting your life on this if it's not?。
And that sounds very alarming.。
But somehow, you know, in my experience the devil never likes。
to be noticed.。
He wants to do things in a very subtle way.。
And so looking at that over time, I don't think I let。
anybody in or I talked about it.。
But it wasn't because I was embarrassed or hiding it.。
It was that I didn't think it was a big deal.。
And yet 18 months later I feel my faith eroding.。
I would be speaking on stages about Jesus and in the back of。
my head I would be questioning, am I selling a myth?。
Y'all, let me just tell you, you don't know my faith.。
You don't know my story.。
But I have gotten to be someone who has walked on waves and。
seen God do complete miracles.。
The fact that I was questioning my faith did not equal the life。
I was leading at all.。
And I don't tell anybody and 18 months later I do finally open。
my mouth and say this has gotten pretty bad.。
Now the irony is the reason I finally told people was I。
watched the second to last Avengers movie.。
Yeah.。
And it's the one, I'm sorry if y'all don't know this but you。
are really late and I'm not going to protect you from the。
spoiler.。
The second to last one, y'all know what happens.。
Some of the superheroes and half the earth evaporates into dust.。
That's the worst.。
Yeah, it's a bummer.。
And then they leave you there.。
So I see that movie, you guys, and I go home and I can't。
breathe.。
And for two to three days I'm having panic.。
Because that's what I'm afraid of.。
I'm just afraid it goes to dust.。
And that none of it mattered.。
And I'm like, I'm not going to watch that movie again.。
And finally I start talking and realizing this is really。
affecting me.。
My fear of death.。
I can't even watch a Marvel movie without having panic。
attacks.。
And so I mention it to a friend and what happens when I bring。
somebody into it.。
Two things.。
First thing that happens is I said it out loud and as I heard。
myself say, I don't know if I even believe in God anymore.。
That's how dramatic it was.。
I love wrestling with stuff like that.。
It was dramatic when I said it.。
And as the words came out of my mouth, I started laughing.。
And I was like, that's not true.。
I believe in God.。
Like I literally heard myself say what I had been saying in my。
head for 18 months.。
And I said it.。
And I was so aware that it was not true.。
And my sweet friend that heard it, she watches me live and。
she's like, Ginny, that's not true.。
I watched you live the last two years.。
You love and trust God.。
And then the second thing I said, I think I have been under。
spiritual attack.。
Yeah.。
I mean it was obvious and I totally missed it.。
And so after that, to answer your question, I got angry.。
Like this wasn't any longer just this situation of you know what?。
We all think negative thoughts.。
Let's be authentic about it.。
What are you thinking negatively and what is your anxiety.。
Let's talk about it.。
It turned to war.。
I was like no, no, no.。
This is the enemy and he got me alone in the dark and told me。
whatever he wanted.。
And I am not going to let that happen to half the church.。
Or you know there is a bunch of guys here, I will bring you into。
it too.。
I am not going to let that happen.。
Because if we are in a place where the enemy can tell us --。
I grew up in a church where they said don't talk about the devil。
too much.。
And I read Ephesians and dark cosmic forces are coming for us.。
And I thought let's talk about it a little.。
And on this subject, I think we need to bring that in.。
And I will tell you why in a minute.。
Because there is scripture that brings it in clearly.。
That we are not fighting flesh.。
That we are fighting spirit.。
And we have to recognize that there is a war for our minds.。
And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.。
And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.。
And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.。

And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.。
I am reading this verse again...。
Do we believe that?。
Like if we don't believe that church, we don't have anything。
else to stand on.。
Like the medicine, it doesn't matter.。
The other stuff is only going to be a fix for a little while.。
The practical ways that we can be grateful instead of negative.。
All of that, those practices are powerful.。
And God taught us about these practices that help us be。
grateful.。
And help us train our minds and discipline our minds.。
The scripture is full of that and we will talk about some of。
those.。
But if we don't understand first and foremost that we are at war。
and there is an enemy and he wants to kill, steal and destroy。
you.。
And you have power and authority and divine weapons that destroy。
strongholds.。
And I am like, that's where -- let's wake up to that first so。
that we quit playing defense.。
And honestly we are not even playing defense.。
And like he's just beating us up.。
Like that's what I did for 18 months.。
He just beat me up for 18 months and I let him.。
And that's where I am going, okay, let's change our posture.。
Let's start with this.。
That one, do you realize that the spirit of God is available。
to you.。
And that he wants to work with you and fight the enemy with。
you.。
And that there are people that want to help you fight the。
enemy.。
And that there is a word that teaches us how to fight the。
enemy.。
But it's all going somewhere.。
And it's not like I am going to get fixed today.。
That's what I am going to do.。
That's how we read scripture, we want it to fix us.。
Rather than we are at war.。
And everything you think and everything you feel and every。
behavior you have and every relationship you have, it's。
playing into that war.。
And so the cost if we don't fight back, if we just let the。
enemy stick us in a corner with anxiety and make us obsess about。
ourselves and our problems.。
Instead of the power of God in me and through me and what can。
happen.。
That is terrifying and it shuts us down.。
And so what I love about scripture is it starts with this。
big story and narrative.。
Hey, let's start with Hebrews 12, part of the narrative.。
Run the race that is set before you, fixing your eyes on Jesus。
and throwing off the burden and weight that is set before you.。
And I think as we are going, as we realize, okay, all of this is。
supposed to fit into this bigger story where there is a plan and。
it is to take me out.。
There is a plan and it is to take you out.。
So we have got to start with -- and let me tell you why this。
matters.。
Because then you hate it.。
Then you are like motivated.。
It's not just about your happiness.。
It's not just about your freedom.。
It's not just about the way you have a greater impact on the。
kingdom.。
It is about eternity.。
And if you realize that that anxiety -- I don't mean to put。
too much weight on it but I think we haven't put enough, right.。
I can see y'all, are y'all with me?。
Okay.。
So I think we put too much of just this passing idea that we。
are just victims and how we feel and how we -- you know, what。
we are thinking about.。
All of these things, this is my lot.。
I struggle with anxiety.。
And I am like, all right, how are we going to fight that?。
Let's start fighting that.。
And let's not take that for granted and struggle with this。
for the next 50, 60 years we have on earth.。
And if we change our posture, yes, there are things we can。
do that help in that fight that scripture is clear about.。
But I think what I hope you hear from this and what I hope you。
take away is that you have a lot more power than you think.。
And I think what I hope you take away is that so many people that。
have processed this and read the book and gone through months。
after that and what it looks like for them is that you will。
start to sense that you are anxious like I did today and。
you will say, you know what, I don't want to stay there and I。
don't want my brain to stay there for more than a day.。
So I am going to go -- I am going to make a priority for my。
mind today and sit down with somebody that loves me and sit。
down with somebody that loves me and I will be able to do that。
and I will be able to do that.。

>> 2,000 years before Freud or any of you came along, welcome to where we have been for 2,000 years.。
And so that's why this is such a crucial and important topic.。
And anything you would add on that?。
>> Oh, that's good.。
Yeah, I just -- I feel like --。
>> I thought so.。
It was well delivered.。
>> Well done.。
Yeah.。
I mean, here's the thing.。
We're all trying so hard to work on our behavior.。
And this is why if you have never done the work in your life.。
If you have been abused in any form.。
Any form.。
If you have -- you know, for all of us.。
I bet most of us can remember a time when everything changed.。
You may not have been physically abused.。
But you can remember when you picked up one of those lies.。
I was 12 years old.。
I'm sitting in my dad's recliner with him.。
And I felt so safe.。
Safe enough to sit like really close to my dad.。
And just sit there and talk to him.。
And we were looking at the ceiling.。
I remember it had popcorn.。
We were in my childhood home.。
And I remember he started asking me questions like this.。
12 years old.。
Do you think you're going to make homecoming court this year?。
Do you think, you know, so-and-so likes you?。
How are your grades?。
He was running through a list of things that I could tell.。
He thought if you maximize those things, then you're going to be a good daughter.。
Then you're going to be a good human.。
And as a little girl, it's the first time I remember feeling like I am not safe.。
And I am not enough as I am.。
And that began a journey for me that I struggled with until 30 years old.。
Where I felt like I could not hit an invisible line that kept moving.。
And I was chasing it with all my guts.。
And I loved God.。
And I was a competing idol of approval.。
That ran right beside my love for God.。
And that verse in Hebrews 12, that it hindered me.。
And was it my fault that I picked that up?。
No.。
But was it my fault that I didn't fight it?。
Yes.。
So there's probably a moment that you can remember when that lie entered in.。
And so we've got to do this work.。
I know some of you guys are like, oh, my gosh.。
I'm going to have some deep talk with my girlfriend tonight.。
I feel it.。
But I promise you it is worth going back and figuring out what did you pick up?。
And where did you pick it up?。
Because if it is from the enemy, which all lies are from him.。
John tells us Jesus was really clear, he's the father of lies and it's his native tongue.。
It's how he speaks.。
So if we just let those lies grow in us, we don't want to live with that anymore.。
Yeah, that's good.。

Yeah.。
So you have been married to Zach?。
23 years.。
23 years.。
Razorback?。
No, we met at Canica camps.。
Nothing like a good camp love story.。
We were kissing in the K-Dome.。
Wow, that definitely violates camp policy.。
It did.。
Sorry, Joe.。
It ended up working out.。
And you guys have four kids.。
What would you say to most of the room by far is single.。
And in terms of qualities that drew you to Zach.。
No marriage is perfect.。
I know you guys have been shared here before.。
We're all on a journey.。
But what were the qualities that drew you to Zach other than he。
was a good French kisser in the K-Dome.。
He was.。
That was a joke.。
He is.。
Okay.。
Save the e-mail.。
What qualities would you say, man, these are the things to look for.。
Because you have a daughter.。
And you have young adult kids who you would say, these are the qualities to look for in a husband.。
Absolutely.。
This is a little bit secret story I don't think I have ever told.。
Right before we got married, this is probably two months.。
So we didn't do save the date back then.。
That's a new expensive feature of weddings.。
So that hadn't gone out.。
But it was probably about the time that would have gone out.。
And I was having doubts that I should marry him.。
And I remember we were long-distance dating.。
And I was like, I don't know.。
And I remember we were long-distance dating.。
And so I barely knew the guy.。
We just -- it was scary that we were getting married.。
Except that the guy was godly.。
And I remember one day we were together.。
And I was like, Lord, I can't go into marriage wondering if I should be married to this guy.。
You have to seal the deal here.。
And I prayed.。
I remember that day going to war with it and saying, God, you have to be clear with me if this is the man I am supposed to marry.。
And of course a voice from the sky -- I am just kidding.。
That didn't happen.。
But what did happen is I opened my Bible and I began to go, okay, what do we know about marriage?。
What do we know about the kind of guy I should marry?。
And I just began to write a list in my little journal.。
And I was like, he needs to be humble.。
He needs to pray.。
He needs to be committed and surrender to Jesus and do whatever he says.。
Check.。
He needs to honor me.。
He needs to believe that I have, you know, gifts and that he's going to partner with me in those.。
Check.。
And I was like, okay, I am going to do that.。
Because it was super simple things.。
And at the end of that, I looked at the list and I was like, is this who he is?。
And the answer was absolutely yes.。
I mean, he's not perfect in any of those things.。
In fact, we went on to have difficult first five years of marriage and did get some counseling, a lot of counseling after that.。
But he was a godly man.。
And he loved him and he was going to follow him and I knew it.。
And so I committed to marry the man.。
And I'm saying this because I think we think there's some special feeling that will come over us at some point that's like, light, shine from heaven, anoint the girl, this is her.。
And I'm having these conversations with my kids.。
I was like, it doesn't work like that.。
Look around and see who's following God.。
I don't know if you're attracted.。
Yes, maybe that's a part of it.。
But no, that's not really a biblical part of it.。
Marrying a girl that loves God and is spending her life doing that.。
Because the purpose of marriage is that we display the relationship between Jesus and the church.。
And if it is not sacrificial, if it is not committed no matter what to biblical story lines that he's given us, then I don't see -- it's just what the TV teaches us.。
It's just what, you know, it's just what culture teaches us.。
That's not love.。
What love is, is two people committed to God and committing to each other for all their life.。
And it won't feel -- because here's the thing.。
If you get the attraction, good.。
But it will go away.。
So it's like why chase something that's fickle.。
If you get a guy, and I did, and I was attracted to him at different times.。
But I did -- he's going to kill me.。
He's watching live.。
I love you, baby.。
I'm so attracted to you now.。
Oh, my gosh, I'm in so much trouble.。
But it wasn't -- what did you say?。
Nothing.。
I'm not going to repeat it.。
But it wasn't about the attraction.。
It was that I just felt confused and I didn't feel sure.。
And what made me sure was not feelings that seemed to come and go.。
It was the character of God that I saw in his life.。
And I think that is what has seen us through 23 years.。
And I look at him now, y'all, and I am totally attracted to him, baby.。
I am so attracted to you.。
I cannot wait to get home tonight.。
But -- but -- but it isn't about that even today.。
Because if that goes away tomorrow, I don't care.。
Like I'm in this with this man to be for the good of people and the glory of God.。
So it's just a different way to view marriage.。
And we are such teammates and we have fun and we are running the race.。
But it was built on a vision of obeying God together, not on feelings.。
So good.。
Okay, last question, just as we wrap up.。
Your ministry has given you a platform.。
You speak to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people a year.。
A lot of them are young adults.。
You have young adult kids.。
Anything you would say to encourage, sharpen, challenge,。
just if you had a few minutes to just share anything with this group and those listening.。
I would say this.。
That go build a life that is building heaven.。
And leave the details out of that.。
If you can look around at your life.。
And I'm not talking about vocational ministry, for goodness sakes.。
I'm largely ministering.。
We largely minister to Christians.。
You know, you guys are the ones in the trenches.。
What we're supposed to do is equip the saints for the work of the kingdom.。
I'm just talking about in everything you're doing, like spending it in this eternal story we've been talking about tonight.。
And the reason I say that is, guys, I don't know how much longer we have before Jesus is going to come back.。
And my sense is I'm spending a lot of time actually with Gen Z right now.。
That's a lot of who we minister to is college students.。
I'm looking at Gen Z and some of you are in that category.。
And I'm going, we may be preparing them to usher in the kingdom.。
There's that sense in me of just, I want you to be Daniels in Babylon.。
And I want you to know God and to be disciplined and to care about -- I mean, when that becomes the storyline,。
when you're like, you know what, Jesus could come back soon.。
I work with Bible translation too.。
I'm a big translator for a people group in a jungle.。
I'm just kidding.。
I just give them money.。
But I do think that in 13 years they're saying that we're going to have reached every single language.。
13 years, which is one of the things that has to happen before Jesus can come back.。
So the fact that we're closing in on almost everything that we would need for revelation to happen,。
for Jesus to come back, means that we should be taking our lives very seriously.。
And so the addiction, the distraction, the anxiety that I see in the church,。
I want to fight it not so that you can live happier lives, so that we can usher in the kingdom of God together.。
Because we might just be up.。
Like it might be the calling of our lives.。
So take it all seriously.。
Take it all seriously.。
Because we don't want to be those that are sleeping when he comes back.。
We want to be those that are running and we're out of breath and we're not surprised.。
We're like, hallelujah, I don't even have to die.。
Like I get to just fly up to heaven.。
You know?。
Let's be that.。
And I think if we could take it that seriously, you know, I just -- gosh, the world needs hope right now.。
And we could be that hope for them.。
>> So good.。
Would you mind -- yeah.。
Would you mind praying that that would be the case and praying in particular for anyone who is trapped,。
whether they would say that or not, just in the spiral of fear or anxiety or lust or anger or just sad.。
>> Yeah.。
I'm going to pray on my knees.。
Because we are fighting spiritual forces.。
Because the greatest desire of the enemy would to cause every single human that hears my voice right now to be stuck。
and helpless and hopeless and distracted and addicted, checked out.。
And, God, that is against your will for us.。
And I believe things are at stake that we can't imagine, and yet you imagine them and you know them.。
And so I pray for your spirit to set us free, God, and not in some magical way,。
but in participation, choices that we make every day to pursue you instead of pursue the world.。
To pursue you instead of pursue our flesh and what it craves and what it wants.。
God, I pray for a holy people set apart and blameless, God, not perfect, but covered with the blood and living like it.。
Believing it, God, not just saying, yeah, I'm a Christian, but believing that that changes everything and letting it.。
God, I pray against half-heartedness.。
I pray, God, that our whole hearts would be surrendered to you.。
And at any place that they're not, God, would you root it out, would you show us, would you help us name it.。
The place that we've loved something more than you, that we've let the enemy lie to us,。
that we've completely submitted to darkness in a way that is not pleasing to you.。
God, show us, make it so clear where we can't shake it and help us confess it.。
Help us surrender it.。
God, I pray for every person hearing my voice, God, would they not be apathetic?。
Would they walk out of here, would they grab people by the shoulder and say, how can I fight for you?。
How can I pray for you?。
How can I help you love Jesus more?。
Would we be those kind of people for each other?。
Would we believe that you are more powerful than the enemy that is seeking to kill, steal, and destroy us?。
And would we act like it?。
And would we go to your word constantly?。
God, not even daily, but hour by hour, would we be going to it constantly?。
Because it is the only hope that we have.。
Without it, God, we are hopeless, we are helpless, we are worthless, we are unlovable.。
But because of you, we are the most loved people on planet Earth.。
So help, God, that love go and reach out to the ends of the Earth.。
God, I just, I picture everybody in here, and I'm picturing this generation, and I'm picturing us in heaven.。
And I just, I want so badly, more than anything else on Earth,。
I want so badly for us to get up there and like high-five and be like, "We left it on the field."。
Like, "We did everything we could to build the kingdom of God while we were here."。
And so anything prohibiting that in me, in us,。
God, take it out and help us be faithful to choose you day after day.。
In Jesus' name, amen.。
- Amen. - Thanks, guys.。
- Thank you, Jenny.。
Can you guys give it up for Jenny Allen? Thank you, Jenny.。
I'm just going to wrap this up, and we're going to close in song.。
I think some of us in the room, we're in that escape room.。
And you're in that place, and you feel stuck.。
And I want you to know it's because you are.。
And it may be stuck in depression.。
It may be stuck in anxiety.。
It may be stuck in a pornography addiction.。
It may be stuck in a really toxic relationship.。
It may be stuck in that there's so much trauma from sexual abuse you've never told anybody about.。
It wasn't your fault, but you've never dealt with that.。
And now it begins to bleed out into your life.。
You don't trust people because of what your dad did.。
And you're stuck, and you're in those walls, not physically, but inside of your mind and inside of your life.。
And it's impacting the rest of your future and your current reality.。
And you're going to be there, and you're going to be stuck until you do what we had to do in that escape room,。
where you're willing to say, "Hey, I don't care. I need help. I need help. I need a clue.。
I need something from the outside to help me get unstuck."。
And you go to God's Word and God's people, and you know what you're going to find?。
You're going to find steps towards freedom.。
And you don't have to stay stuck, but let me be abundantly clear, you're going to,。
until you're willing to do what the Bible says is called "surrender."。
I can't do it all on my own. I can't fight this on my own.。
You weren't made to fight it on your own.。
You were made to go to God's people, to God's Word, and to say, "I need help."。
And tonight is a chance for you to do that.。
And if you take those steps, your life and your future is going to change.。
And if you don't, let me be clear, if you're 30, 10 years from now, you're going to be the same.。
That thing you're hiding, eating disorder, past abortion, shame and guilt you carry,。
they're not going away.。
If anything, they may just grow and grow until you're willing to say, "I need help."。
And what you'll find is God, His Word, His people, will come rushing in.。
And tonight I wanted you to hear, there are steps that you can take.。
But you've got to be willing to say, "Man, I want to be free. I need help."。
Others of you, you're in a place where you need to know that you,。
the greatest thing you need to surrender is the fact that you think that you could earn a relationship with God.。
You've never put your faith in Jesus. In fact, you don't even know what the Bible teaches.。
You think the Bible teaches good people go to heaven, bad people go to hell.。
I just need to be a good person. This place has pretty cool vibes.。
And you know, they don't make me wear a suit in church. That's kind of cool.。
So I'm coming in here, and you think that God is angry at you, can't forgive you.。
You need to read your Bible and attend church, and then He'll love you more.。
Then you could have a relationship with Him.。
And you have bought a lie. The Bible doesn't teach that.。
It teaches not good people in heaven, bad people in hell.。
Forgiven people go to heaven.。
And the only way you get forgiveness is by putting your trust not in what you have done,。
or what you did, to be the thing that keeps you in relationship with God,。
or keeps you out of heaven with God.。
That's never been what Christianity teaches.。
It teaches, you know who gets to have a relationship with God?。
You know whose life begins to change?。
You know who spends eternity in heaven?。
People who go, "I'm not enough. I surrender.。
If I'm ever going to have a relationship with God, it's only because of Jesus.。
I think I'm a good person, try to be nice, pay my taxes."。
Not enough.。
The Bible has never taught those things matter.。
It's never taught those things change how God feels about you.。
It teaches people who say, "I'm a sinner.。
My life is full of messed up decisions I made.。
I have hurt people. I've done things I'm ashamed of."。
But because Jesus on that cross gave his life for me,。
paid for my decisions, my sin,。
all of those have been forgiven.。
God doesn't hold them against me.。
Any sin in my future, already forgiven.。
Because on that cross, the Son of God came to this earth,。
was crucified, was buried, and he rose again.。
And you know what that shows?。
He paid for all sin ever.。
He conquered all sin. He even conquered death.。
When he rose from the grave, it's like the check cleared.。
The credit card went through.。
It was more than enough.。
People who accept Jesus paid for their sin.。
Those are people who spend eternity with God.。
Those are people whose life changed.。
But you know what it takes in order to do that? It's a really hard thing.。
You've got to say, "I need help.。
I can't do it on my own.。
I can't do it on my own."。
And you know what? You can't.。
And he's done everything that he can to say, "You can't.。
That's why I gave my life for you."。
If you'll trust in that,。
your eternity will change,。
and your present reality will begin to change.。
Let me pray.。
Father, thank you that you are more powerful。
than any thought,。
any thought pattern,。
any cosmic forces of darkness,。
any enemy in this world.。
You're more powerful than any evil that could take place in the hearts of people.。
You're more powerful than sickness, than sin, than death.。
You are victorious,。
and nothing can stand against you.。
And you have allowed us, through your Spirit,。
the weapons to wage war in the mind.。
So I pray tonight that those who are battling anxiety,。
they would experience freedom.。
Not just in a moment, but in a day by day, moment by moment,。
second by second, thought by thought, war.。
By holding on to what is true, what's noble, what's pure, what's lovely, what's right,。
you begin to create pathways and change the way that they think,。
and therefore change the way that they live,。
and you would set people free.。
I pray for those who've never put their faith in Jesus.。
Tonight, they would realize they're a sinner.。
They've done things that you, according to your Word,。
you say, "Man, the wages of sin or the repayment for sin,。
the consequences is separation from God."。
Unless you're willing to say, "I need help,。
and I accept what you did for me,"。
that they would receive the payment your Son gave,。
the Savior of the world, the King of kings,。
and they would find rest in your hands, in your plan, in your love.。
Father, we need your help, all of us.。
We've got 60,000 thoughts a day, many of which, maybe most of which,。
are not in a direction that's leading us to the life that we want.。
They're not captive to your Spirit, so we ask and invite,。
just plead that you would help us, God.。
Thank you that you provided your Word and your people.。
Help us to go to war.。
We love you, in Christ's name, amen.。
