[Music]。
Porch, how we doing?。
[Cheering]。
Come on, come on.。
I am so excited.。
I am sincerely so excited。
to be with you guys tonight.。
This message, this scripture,。
has really ministered to me.。
Even in preparing it for you。
and preparing it for this evening。
has really ministered to me.。
Let me just start with asking this question.。
Have you guys ever had to carry a bunch of chairs?。
Have you ever done that?。
If you've been to the launch retreat with us,。
we put out a thousand chairs,。
we've got to collect a thousand chairs.。
You're loading them up, the folding chairs,。
and you're carrying them in a cart.。
What that means is people spread out and they're helping.。
You've seen the scene where you're folding up the chairs。
and you're carrying them.。
Everyone carries, if you've ever noticed,。
everyone carries different amounts of chairs.。
Right?。
My ten-year-old daughter,。
she's got her and David Marvin,。
they each have one in each hand.。
Then you've got Blake McJunkin,。
like big Blake.。
He's carrying 27 chairs。
and just kind of walking up effortlessly。
and like setting them down.。
Everybody has different stacks.。
They carry them different ways.。
They can carry different amounts of chairs.。
Every now and then,。
someone will drop them.。
Those aluminum chairs on that concrete floor,。
it's loud.。
It makes this loud noise,。
this big commotion.。
The only reason。
anyone would ever drop the chairs。
is because they carried more。
than they were supposed to.。
They thought they could carry this many,。
but they didn't have a grip.。
One slips out。
and it just makes this big commotion.。
Everybody turns around, stops,。
"What's going on over there?。
Oh, so-and-so dropped the chairs again."。
I start there。
because it's been an interesting season for me.。
I just want to let you in。
in my world a little bit.。
I metaphorically。
and metaphorically。
speaking, I think I carried more chairs。
than I was supposed to。
this summer.。
I had a friend。
really close to me, someone I love,。
got sick。
and I started。
stepping into their life。
and helping them and visiting doctors。
with them and going to appointments。
with them and。
really bearing。
that burden with them.。
I didn't realize how much。
stressful and how difficult it was.。
In the midst of speaking。
engagements, I taught at several。
different camps and was traveling this summer.。
Summers are really busy speaking time.。
I was scheduled。
to teach 25 times。
in six weeks.。
That was kind of going on.。
I signed a book deal.。
I'm writing a book。
to you guys, really. It's called "Welcome to Adulting."。
There were deadlines.。
The deadlines were。
kind of hanging over me.。
I picked up another chair。
and I picked up another chair。
and I picked up another chair.。
I didn't realize how many I had.。
I went down to Austin。
and I taught at a big church in Austin.。
Great opportunities.。
I loved to teach the Word of God.。
I loved to share the gospel.。
I went down there and taught three times,。
back to back to back.。
I was on the road. I was driving back to Dallas。
in a large church on the West Coast called。
one of the largest churches in the world,。
Rick Warren's church, if you know about it.。
I said, "Hey, can you come and speak here。
next Sunday, next weekend?"。
I said, "Man, I'd be honored."。
I came home and I taught here.。
I got on a plane and I flew to California.。
I was sitting in my hotel room.。
I was laying in the hotel bed.。
It was the night before I was teaching.。
The next day,。
it was going to be streamed。
to 13 campuses,。
30,000 people.。
I'm laying in bed and I can't sleep.。
I'm like, "Man, why can't I sleep?"。
I've got to sleep. I've got to teach.。
I've got to teach tomorrow.。
I'm going to be in front of 30,000 people.。
They brought in this silly guy from Texas.。
I've got to have my act together.。
Lord, help me sleep.。
When you try to sleep, you can't sleep.。
I'm laying there and I'm like, "Why can't I sleep?"。
I feel my heart just go boom.。
Ba-da-ba-boom.。
Ba-da-ba-boom.。
Something's not right.。
Something's not right with my heart, my physical heart.。
Something's wrong.。
I can't sleep. Something's wrong with my heart.。
I get through the night.。
I go the next day. I teach three times.。
I'm supposed to.。
I get on a plane. I come back to。
Dallas.。
I'm sitting in my house now.。
Ba-da-ba-boom.。
Ba-da-ba-boom.。
Thunder beats in my chest.。
I go to the emergency room.。
"Hey, guys. Something's not right."。
They hooked me up to an EKG, all these。
machines and wires.。
I said, "Yeah, I see some PVCs."。
I'm like, "What are PVCs?"。
"Pipes? What are you talking about?"。
They're like, "No. Premature ventricular contractions."。
"Oh, man. That doesn't sound good."。
That's just something I've been dealing with.。
Asking the Lord, honestly, to take from me.。
But in it, I see。
His extreme mercy.。
I don't believe that。
all health issues are caused by sin.。
Certainly don't believe that.。
That's a gross heresy.。
But as I look at my own,。
I can see a sin。
attached to it.。
The sin that is attached to it。
is the sin of pride.。
It's the pride of a Savior complex,。
thinking that I'm the only one that can help somebody.。
Moving into their situation,。
instead of allowing them to lean on their community,。
it's the sin of。
finding identity and success。
and book deals.。
The sin of wanting。
people to think much of me。
and not being able to say no.。
Not wanting to say no because every time you say yes,。
you're saying no to something.。
I didn't realize that, so I just kept saying yes.。
I kept saying yes, and going here,。
and flying here, and doing this.。
I'm thinking, "Man, this is all great."。
Before you know it, you start leaning on your own gifts,。
which is a sin.。
Just leaving God out of it and just going,。
"I do this routine."。
The sin of routine, where it's like,。
"I'm going to step up there, I'm going to put a microphone on,。
I'm going to speak, I'm going to open the Word, I'm going to teach,。
I'm going to give this illustration."。
You're just going through these things.。
It was the sin of pride.。
Pride is the grossest sin.。
The mother of all sins.。
In fact, C.S. Lewis。
says this about pride.。
Pride is the...。
He says, "According to。
Christian teachers, the essential vice,。
the utmost evil, is pride.。
Unchastity, or being。
unpure,。
anger, greed, drunkenness,。
and all that are mere。
flea bites in comparison.。
It was through pride that the devil。
became the devil.。
Pride leads to every other vice.。
It is the complete anti-God。
state of mind.。
Pride says that, "I want to be。
like God." Lucifer, in the kingdom of heaven,。
fell from heaven with the fallen angels.。
He says, "God, I don't want to worship you.。
I want to be like you." Adam and Eve, in the garden,。
says, "God, we don't trust you. You say。
that that's not good, but we want to see。
what it is. We think maybe you're holding goodness。
from us. That's pride."。
It's the biggest。
struggle in the room。
today, and it's the biggest struggle。
of everyone listening。
this evening.。
And I believe pride...。
Pride is the source of your anxiety.。
If you find。
yourself anxious, I want。
you to trace it back to pride. I know。
that's not helpful. I know that's not。
helpful. I understand that when I。
say pride is the source of your anxiety, it doesn't。
help you be less anxious. But if。
it's true,。
I think we can find something helpful。
in that truth, especially in this。
verse we're going to be。
in. And so we're starting a new series。
tonight. I know it's the end of the year. This is。
the series that we will kick the year off. It's called。
Vice and Virtue. Vice。
and Virtue, where every week we will look at a。
vice and a virtue, the menaces and the marks。
of Christianity.。
And so tonight, the subject is。
pride and humility, the vice and。
the virtue, pride and。
humility as we dive。
in on this specific topic.。
And so there's some questions I can ask you to see if you。
struggle with pride.。
Are you anxious?。
Are you critical。
of others?。
Are you defensive when someone。
points out sin in your life?。
Do you justify?。
Explain it away. Do you quickly notice。
pride in others? He's prideful. She's so。
prideful. Do you constantly。
seek out others' approval?。
Are you。
insecure?。
Do you take advantage of。
God's grace?。
Do you feel。
shame? Or。
think your sin or brokenness is bigger。
than God's grace? Do you believe。
that you are worthless or unforgiven?。
That's prideful. Does a particular。
sin define you。
more than God's claims on your life?。
I believe this vice, more than。
any other sin, is robbing you of God's。
favor,。
His blessing,。
His joy,。
and His abundant。
grace.。
And if you。
fall into this sin,。
I'm warning you tonight,。
the chairs you're carrying, they are。
going to come crashing down.。
It is only a matter of time.。
It's only a matter of time。
before there's a big。
noise and a commotion around。
you. And at the base。
of it is pride.。
I'm going to be in 1 Peter 5.。
If you want to turn there。
and your Bibles are on your phones,。
I want to welcome those tuning in from。
around the world, especially our friends in Fort Worth。
this evening, our friends in。
Houston, and those that。
are joining the stream online through。
the app. In 1 Peter。
5, I'll read the Scripture to。
you, and before I do, I want you to know。
this has been a lifeline for me. I don't know that。
my heart's ever been more around a Scripture that I've。
taught, because when that happened to me。
this summer, what I did is I took a dry erase marker。
and I wrote this on my mirror.。
And every morning and every night, I would。
read it to myself, this specific Scripture.。
This is what it says. "All of you,。
everyone, clothe yourself with humility。
toward one another, because。
God opposes the proud," from the Proverbs.。
"God opposes the proud, but shows。
favor to the humble. Humble yourselves。
therefore under God's mighty hand,。
that He may lift you up in due time.。
Cast all your anxiety on。
Him, because He cares for you.。
Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy,。
the devil, prowls around like a roaring。
lion, looking for someone to devour.。
Resist him, standing。
firm in the faith, because you。
know that the family of believers。
throughout the world is undergoing the same。
kind of sufferings.。
And the God of all grace, who called you to。
His eternal glory in Christ, after you。
have suffered a little while, will。
Himself," that God,。
Creator God, "will Himself restore。
you and make you strong,。
firm, and steadfast. To Him。
be the power forever and ever.。
Amen." Now let me just show。
you something real quick. Consider if you've been in church。
for a while, how many memory verses are。
in this little section of Scripture, back to back to back.。
You ever heard this? "Clothe yourself with humility."。
You ever heard, "God opposes the proud。
but gives grace to the humble." You ever heard,。
"Cast all your anxieties on Him, because He。
cares for you." Have you ever heard, "Your enemy, the。
devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for。
someone to devour." All。
those verses are jam-packed right。
here in this little section of Scripture,。
back to back to back. And they all seem like。
new ideas. I want to show you, I don't think they are.。
I think that they're。
tied together. And so as we move through。
this, we're going to look at how pride brings opposition,。
humility brings help.。
And before you leave here。
this evening, Peter,。
who wrote this to。
the persecuted church,。
is going to tell us to put on humility.。
Put it on.。
And so,。
it says, "All of you, clothe yourself with humility。
toward one another, because God。
opposes the proud but shows favor to the。
humble." My first point this。
evening is that pride brings opposition.。
That if you find yourself。
thinking a lot about yourself,。
or better said,。
thinking about yourself a lot,。
you are going to find yourself。
marching against opposition.。
The opposition of God,。
the opposition of self, and the opposition。
of Satan. All of those。
forces will be coming against you when。
you begin to think about yourself。
too much.。
Now this is something that we do. When I say。
the opposition of God, it says God opposes。
the proud, but shows。
favor to the humble. It says that we're to put。
on humility. Here's what I would tell you.。
Just like you identify a team by their。
uniform, like if you're watching a game,。
you know who's playing by the colors。
that they're wearing.。
You can see whether it's the Cowboys。
or the Mavericks or whoever it is。
based on the uniform that they have.。
When you wear pride,。
you are wearing the uniform of the。
other team. When I say the other。
team, I mean the team that is playing。
against God.。
That you have the Creator of the heavens and the。
earth working, actively。
working against you, the most powerful。
force in the world.。
So he says, "Humble。
yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty。
hand, that He may lift you up in due time.。
Cast all your anxiety。
on Him, because He cares for you."。
And this verse。
reveals something very interesting。
and yet extremely unpopular.。
That。
the source。
of anxiety is pride.。
And the solution。
is humility.。
Now stay with me there, don't let me lose you。
with just a band-aid statement like。
"the solution is humility."。
We'll dive deeper into that.。
But consider this for a moment,。
that the source of。
anxiety is pride.。
I know。
that doesn't feel helpful, but if it is true,。
then we can test it。
and I think it will prove。
to be helpful. Let's just consider。
testing it for a second.。
If there's something,。
if there's someone rather,。
and they're cared for。
by someone who。
is all-powerful,。
they're in the care and the。
protection of someone who is all-powerful.。
If that person feels。
absolutely loved and absolutely。
protected and absolutely provided。
for, can they。
be anxious?。
And yet if we take God。
at His promises, are we not absolutely。
loved? Absolutely。
provided for? And。
absolutely protected by God, the。
creator of the heavens and the earth?。
That a sparrow doesn't hit the ground apart。
from His will.。
And then the struggle is, "Well then,。
I want to believe that, but how do I believe。
that more? How do I jump。
over that hurdle where I can take God at。
His promises, that I can believe upon。
those things?" We're going to see in the Scripture.。
The core。
of our anxiety is doubt of God's goodness,。
which is to say,。
we know better about God's character than He。
declares. We begin。
to question, "Is He good? Does He love us?。
Can He actually protect us?。
Does He have the power to protect us?"。
Anxiety is not a battle。
against something else, but。
it's a battle against ourselves. And so this is the。
opposition of self. Pride brings。
opposition.。
If you can rid yourself of pride,。
you will in turn rid yourself of anxiety.。
It says, "Be alert and of sober。
minds. Your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a。
roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.。
Resist him. Resist him.。
Standing firm in the faith, because you know。
that the family of believers throughout the world。
is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.。
And it seems like such a new thought,。
that he's just jumping, okay? God opposes the。
kingdom. Cast your anxieties on Him. Hey, your enemy,。
the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion. But they're not.。
They're not new thoughts. I think。
what Peter is telling us。
is that the things that we're anxious about。
are the playpen that Satan plays in.。
It's the fence.。
Like, he knows what we're。
worried about. He knows what we're anxious about.。
And that's where he's going after. You're never going。
to get married. You're。
going to stay single. You're like, "They don't like you.。
Hey, you're not going to make enough。
money. You're never going to make six figures.。
You might lose your job."。
He knows that. He's just there. Boom. Boom.。
He's looking for the chinks in your armor,。
the gaps in your armor, and he's just shooting。
fiery darts right there.。
He knows where you doubt.。
And your pride。
feeds that lion.。
Your pride feeds that。
lion. He feasts。
on those things that。
you trust in other than。
God. He feasts on the areas。
of your life where you don't trust。
God and the ask, the command。
is that you would starve him.。
He's a stray cat.。
He's a stray cat.。
He's a smelly cat. Phoebe from。
Friends would write a song about him.。
That's who he is, and he's just。
hanging around. And if you feed a stray。
cat, what's he going to do? "Oh, man.。
Give me some more. Give me some。
more. I like that. Give me some more.。
I'm not going anywhere." If you。
starve a stray cat, what's he do?。
He leaves.。
Satan。
works like Netflix.。
Okay?。
He does. Netflix and Satan,。
they're one and the same.。
Here's。
what he does, right? You know how Netflix works, right?。
It's like, "Oh, oh, you like。
Friends? Oh, you watch Friends?。
How about Seinfeld? How about this? How about--。
Oh, you like Stranger Things。
Episode 1 or Season 1? How about Season。
2? Season 2 just came out. Do you like Season 2?。
Oh, you like horror films.。
Oh, you like violence, huh?。
How about this violence? How about this violence?。
How about this violence? How about this violence? How about this violence?。
Oh, you are desperate to get。
married. Here's some romantic comedies。
to fill your tank.。
Watch this. Watch this. Watch this.。
Watch this. Watch this. You see how he works?。
You feed him, and he just。
starts putting things in front of you. You don't even。
realize that you're feeding the very。
struggles that you don't want.。
That those struggles are growing because their。
appetite's growing because you're feeding them。
one by one through a song, through a movie,。
through a video, through the things that you like, through。
magazines, through your Pinterest folder.。
You're just feeding them,。
and they're growing.。
They're growing. Oh.。
Oh, you like to。
look at people naked。
in the act of sex.。
Oh.。
Let me put that in front。
of you here. Let me put that in。
front of you here. Let me put that in front。
of you here. Let me put that in front of you。
here. Let me put that in front of you here. Do you。
see the lie of one last time? I'm going to look。
one last time. I'm going to do that one last time.。
And that appetite just。
grows. That's all you did was feed something.。
It's now harder to stop.。
I'm going to do it one last time.。
No, you're not. You're going to do it。
2,000 more times because you did。
it one more time.。
See what you did?。
You fed him.。
When I actively looked at pornography,。
speaking of pornography,。
it was interesting. It would pop up。
everywhere. I couldn't get away from it.。
It was on my。
computers, on my hard drive. Everywhere I。
go, boom, there it is. Boom, there it is. Every。
billboard, every magazine,。
I'd sit in the grocery store. Boom,。
it's in my face. Everywhere I turned, it was like。
pornography, pornography, pornography. And I thought,。
I'll never get away from it. I'm going to be。
stuck here. I'm going to look at this for the。
rest of my life.。
And now, after。
12 years of sobriety,。
I realize。
that's not the case.。
That to see it today, it。
takes considerable work.。
It's something that I would have to seek。
out. It doesn't keep tripping me up.。
It doesn't keep popping up in front of me.。
And you say, "Well, how did you get to。
a place of recovery?" I asked for。
help. I got to the end of。
myself, and I thought, "You know what? I can't。
defeat this thing by myself.。
I need help. I need someone。
to come in and help me. I need。
someone to save me from this。
thing that I'm feeding. I've grown。
an appetite that is overwhelming.。
I need help.。
I need help." And I。
started asking for help. It's a position of humility.。
Recovery starts with。
humility.。
But your pride,。
it will keep you sick.。
You say, "Man, you can't tell somebody that. You can't。
ask for help." Oh, you asked for help once. You know,。
move on. You said something about it.。
You brought it up to community. They didn't do anything. Keep going.。
My second point from the Scripture is。
that God helps the humble.。
He shows favor to the humble.。
He extends grace to the humble, your Scripture。
may say, your Bible may say. My second point is。
that God helps the humble. See,。
I thought I'd be addicted to porn my entire。
life, but when I started。
asking for help, and not just asking。
for help, but finding a greater satisfaction。
in Jesus,。
I found recovery. Let me。
make that tangible.。
Finding a greater satisfaction in Jesus.。
I started being discipled. I started。
learning the Bible. I started doing。
all the things that you keep saying you're going to do.。
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 2018,。
man, that's your year. You're going to join。
a church. You're going to get in community. You're going to。
memorize some Scripture. You're going to get。
a new Bible and read it every。
single morning. I know.。
I know.。
I started doing those things.。
I started feeding on。
sermons.。
I started educating myself。
to God's Word and His commands.。
I started praying like my life。
depended on it, crying out to God,。
"Please, help me, God.。
I want to stop picturing。
women naked, God.。
God, I'm perverted. Help me, Lord."。
And He did.。
Here's。
what that looked like practically. I can。
remember driving home from work every day. There's。
a billboard on the side of。
635. That's a highway here in。
Dallas.。
And every day。
as I'd leave work, I'd drive by that billboard。
and on that billboard was a woman in a bikini.。
It was like。
an advertisement for some adult store。
underneath it. And every day I'd。
look at that. I'd lust for that every。
day.。
On this particular day, I'm in the car。
and I'm worshiping. I had left a。
Bible study and I had community that night。
and I had read the Scriptures over lunch。
and I was surrounded by men who。
loved me and knew God and who knew me and。
loved God. And so I'm there。
in the car and it's me and Jesus and I'm talking。
to Jesus and I'm praying and I sense。
that that billboard's coming up because I'm driving。
down the highway and it's getting closer and it's。
getting closer. But it seems like。
it feels like Jesus is in the car。
with me because we're talking, we're commuting.。
He feels close to me.。
And as I get closer to that billboard,。
these words come out of my mouth all by myself。
in the car. It's not worth it.。
It's not worth this.。
Glancing up at that。
two-dimensional。
woman who I don't know。
is not worth sacrificing。
closeness to Jesus.。
So you gotta ask every time, is a romantic。
comedy worth it? Is watching that。
one more time worth it? Is listening to that worth it?。
Is going there with your friends worth it?。
One more drink, a shot, is it worth it?。
Is it worth this?。
Because the enemy's right there saying,。
"Feed me. I'm hungry.。
Feed me.。
Feed me.。
Feed me."。
But when your humble God comes to your aid,。
we have one that。
protects us. We are protected under。
the hand of God.。
We know our place, that we're。
the ones that need protection and。
we have a protector. It says, verse 6,。
"Humble yourselves therefore under God's。
mighty hand."。
David's, King David's。
go-to illustration, David and Goliath,。
David and Bathsheba, David the shepherd boy,。
David, his go-to illustration,。
his go-to metaphor。
for God was, "The Lord is。
my," what?。
"The Lord is my shepherd.。
The Lord is。
my shepherd." Now David was a shepherd.。
He knew what this meant. And what he's。
doing is he's putting himself in the story.。
God is his shepherd. He is。
a sheep. Now here's what's interesting about。
being a sheep. Sheep is the most defenseless。
animal in the animal kingdom.。
They've got no claws.。
They've got no sharp teeth. They've got no。
thumbs. They've got nothing.。
They've got no nunchucks or nothing to protect themselves.。
Right? They're sheep.。
They are sheep. They've got no。
crazy laughs, nothing. And so,。
you know what。
happens when a sheep is scared?。
You know what happens when a sheep is scared?。
It falls over.。
True story.。
It's a sponge with sticks。
for legs. That's a sheep.。
Right? And so, here's。
the deal. You're a。
sheep.。
And if you think you're immune to pride,。
you're going to be lunch.。
Because there's an enemy. There's a lion.。
A sheep without a shepherd is。
lunch.。
But a sheep with a shepherd is loved,。
protected,。
and provided for.。
And we have a shepherd. We come under。
his mighty hand. We humble。
ourselves with a constant renewal。
of our mind that there's a God,。
creator of the heavens and the earth, and we。
sit under him.。
We sit under his。
feet. We sit at his feet. We're under his。
hands. He's our protector。
and our provider.。
And as we come under his power, he lifts。
us up, it says. That he's the force。
behind us, pushing us forward.。
And it says, "Cast all your anxieties on him。
because he cares for you."。
It says, "Throw your anxieties。
on him." Why? Why do I。
throw my anxieties on him? It's like, "Throw your。
anxieties." Like he's a coat rack. And you're,。
"Throw your anxieties on him." How do I throw。
my anxieties? Throw my anxieties on who?。
And why? And what? Because。
God loves。
you.。
Right now. Like,。
not later. Not when you're not anxious.。
Like, when you're anxious,。
he loves you.。
He loves you.。
Everything you've done,。
he knows and he chose you.。
You're like, "How do I know he chose me?"。
Look around where you're at right now.。
You're at church.。
On a Tuesday。
night. You're not at, you know,。
$2 margarita bar,。
whatever, right? No, you're here.。
And it's not by chance.。
And I'm not saying because you're here, you're saved.。
I'm saying because you're here, he's pursuing。
you.。
And you need to come to the end of yourself。
and look up and say, "God, I'm ready.。
I'm ready.。
I need your help."。
He loves you.。
And we're about to go on a break.。
Not gonna meet for。
a few weeks.。
And I want you to change。
some things about your life.。
I want you to stop playing。
games. I want you。
to get serious about this。
relationship with Jesus.。
I want you to start talking to him.。
I want you to carve out。
some time every single day and prioritize。
him. And even when you're doing。
the other things that you do, you're。
prioritizing him in your mind. You're thinking。
that he's sending you to places, the places。
that you're going, to work and the conversations。
and the meetings and the classrooms, that。
God's sending you there.。
And what he wants。
from you most is he wants a relationship.。
He cares for you.。
And he wants you to。
cast your anxieties on him. What does that mean?。
You talk to him about what you're concerned。
about. I'll give you a picture of mine.。
I've got a son,。
five-year-old, Weston.。
He's a good boy.。
We're sitting in the living room. He's sitting。
by the fire. It was cold the other day in Dallas。
and we've got。
a fire going and he's sitting by it on the。
hearth, you know, the stone hearth there.。
And I'm sitting on the couch and I'm thinking,。
you know, the stone hearth there. And I'm sitting。
on the couch and。
he says, and he's five-year-old way, he says,。
"Daddy," I'm like, "Yes, yeah, buddy."。
"I'd like to talk。
with you."。
I was like, "Okay, man."。
But I get the sense like this is。
something serious, like not just。
monster trucks and remote-controlled cars.。
Like he wants to chat. And so he's。
sitting there and so I come and sit on the。
other side of the fireplace just like him.。
And so we're both kind of sitting there toes-to-toes,。
just like this. I'm like, "What's up, buddy?" I'm looking at him.。
I'm like, "What's up, buddy?" And I'm like, "Talk to me."。
And he's like, "Daddy, I just don't know。
why I do what I do."。
I'm like, "What did you do?"。
You know? And。
he's like, "Daddy, it's like my mind,。
like these things come to my mind and。
the things that I want to do I don't。
do, but the things that I don't want to do,。
these things I keep on doing."。
And。
for those of you。
that know the Bible, that's。
Romans 7. He's preaching.。
And he's just preaching。
at me and I'm like, "Buddy," and this is what。
I say. And he's just struggling. I'm, dude, tears。
in his eyes. I'm tormented right now.。
And。
I said, "Well, buddy, that's why you have me."。
He said, "Man, I'll help you to know what to do。
and you can ask me and when you've done something。
that you shouldn't have done, you can come to me.。
And as much as I'm able, I'll。
make it right. And if I'm not able to make it right,。
then you'll come with me and we'll go。
in it together and we'll say, 'Man, look what we did.'。
And I'll help you.。
And I'll do that for the rest of your life. That's really my commitment。
to you.。
If you don't know what is。
right and what is wrong, I'll tell you。
and if you've done wrong,。
if you've done the wrong thing,。
you can come to me and I'll do everything I can。
to help you out of that wrong thing。
and to point you back to the right way.。
That's my commitment to you."。
And he says,。
"Daddy,。
I'm really glad we had this talk."。
[laughter]。
I said, "Me too, buddy." I mean, it melted my heart, right?。
I said, "Hey,。
you're a good boy."。
He said, "You're a good daddy."。
I know, that's what I said. I'm like, "I'm done.。
I'm done."。
And, um,。
and it was just the sweetest thing。
and here's what I thought after that.。
I'm like, "That's what God wants from me."。
Do you see just。
the humility there?。
Like, "God, can we talk?"。
"Daddy,。
the things。
that I want to do,。
I don't do and。
the things that you tell me not to do,。
those things I keep doing, I keep going。
back to her, I keep looking at that,。
I keep clicking on that, I call him again.。
I want that.。
That list of Ten Commandments,。
I've broken all of them.。
I need your help.。
From this moment forward,。
can you。
convict me ever so severely。
in the situation that I would always choose right?。
And when I've chosen wrong,。
will you help me?。
Will you remind me to come to you。
that you can make it right。
even when I've chosen wrong?。
That you can show me a way out of that?。
Will you help me?。
Will you remind me to come to you。
that you can make it right。
even when I've chosen wrong?。
May that mark your break.。
Lots of。
conversations like that.。
It's a huge act of faith.。
It's probably the most。
productive, no, it is the most。
productive thing that you can do.。
It allows God to remind you that He。
can handle your problems and how can He remind you。
if He doesn't have the opportunity to remind you。
if you're not going to Him with your。
problems, if you're not going to Him with。
your anxiety. See, anxiety,。
when it drives you to prayer, is a gift.。
Anxiety。
that pushes you to God,。
that is a gift.。
But anxiety that distracts you from。
God, it is a curse.。
It is the enemy's playpen.。
It's where he's jacking。
with you and he'll keep jacking。
with you because he loves to distract。
you from God. It's his goal.。
And so we'll summarize,。
or we'll wrap up rather,。
with the。
exhortation, the admonishment to。
wear humility. He says, "Clothe。
yourself in humility."。
It's how he starts. "Clothe yourself。
in humility that we're His,。
that we belong to God, therefore we have。
a new uniform. We've got new team。
colors. We've got something else to。
wear." Salvation actually starts with humility,。
right? Because salvation starts with。
you coming to a place saying, "Hey God, I。
can't. I need help."。
We're looking at the Ten Commandments and the。
Thou Shalt series and it's like, "I've broken that one, I've。
broken that one." The law, the only thing,。
listen closely, the only thing the law can。
do is show you that you can't keep the。
law. That's Romans 8.。
And if you see that you can't。
keep the law, then you realize you need someone。
to save you from yourself.。
That's Jesus. That's the power of the。
gospel. God doesn't expect you to。
keep the law. He expects you to realize that。
you can't keep the law so that you come to。
a place so that you realize that you need a。
Savior. And do you know that。
a Savior's job description is saving?。
Jesus is really,。
really, really good at moving。
toward people in their time of need.。
He's the best at it.。
And so you come to a place。
where you say, "God, I need help." That's。
a place of humility. And that's where。
salvation starts. And in that moment,。
you have new clothes to wear. Those are the。
clothes of humility. That you would。
clothe yourself in humility. What does that mean?。
That means that when somebody looks at you,。
they don't see somebody peacocking,。
they don't see someone rolling around saying, "Hey,。
look at me. I'm the big man on。
campus. I'm Mr. Dallas,。
Mr. Fort Worth, I'm Mr. H-Town."。
No, they see somebody。
and say, "I'm a servant of the king.。
I don't need you to。
like me. I don't need you to think more of me.。
I don't need more trinkets and treasures.。
I serve the king. All the trinkets。
and treasures are his.。
I just carry his chair.。
I'll sit at。
his throne. I'm a servant."。
So you clothe yourself。
in humility.。
What that tells me, guys,。
and consider this,。
that tells me that humility is something。
you actively put on. That it。
doesn't naturally happen. That pride naturally。
happens. In the flesh, pride。
will consume you, but you have to work.。
You have to do something to。
put on humility. And so consider。
when it's cold outside. Remember when you were。
little, it's cold outside, and your mom's like, "Hey,。
you need to put on a coat." "Why do I need to put on。
a coat?" "Because it's cold outside. And if you。
don't put on a coat, you're going to be cold."。
Now, picture yourself at the。
beach. There's no clouds in the sky.。
The sun's at high noon. It's coming down。
hot. It's 127。
degrees in Texas, and there you are.。
And somebody says, "Hey, you better。
put on some sunscreen.。
Because if you don't put on sunscreen,。
you're going to get burned."。
And what。
Peter's telling us, what the Holy Spirit is。
telling us through His servant Peter。
is that we've got to put on。
humility or else we are standing in。
opposition to the most powerful。
force in the universe.。
And that ain't going to go well。
for us.。
And so we put on。
humility.。
What does this look like。
practically?。
Every day you've got things to do.。
You've got meetings every day. Some of。
you have got a Microsoft Outlook calendar.。
It kind of tells you where you need to go。
and when. And so I've got a friend,。
one of the most godly men I know,。
and every day he wakes up.。
And the same way that I wake up and I think about, "Okay, what do。
I have today? I'm teaching at the porch.。
What am I going to wear?"。
I don't have any meetings.。
"Hey, it's casual Friday. I'm going to。
wear athletic shorts." You think about。
what you're going to wear based on what。
you have to do. And so every day my friend,。
he wakes up, he looks at。
his appointments, and he looks at the meetings。
and he's like, "Man, I'm going to have to really wear some humility。
to that one."。
You know what I mean?。
She annoys me.。
I'm not pointing at you. I'm pointing。
at imaginary。
"She annoys me."。
And so for that。
one I'm going to have to really put on some humility.。
"Oh man, when I go home for Christmas。
that one,。
I'm going to have to really wear。
some humility. When I go to that meeting,。
oh I've got my funnel review,。
oh I've got that appointment with the boss, appointment with the。
principal, oh when I meet with those。
parents,。
I'm going to have to really wear humility。
to that one." And you。
consciously think about it.。
And you humble yourself。
under God's mighty hand. And you。
clothe yourself in humility.。
Because what it says, think about what it says,。
it says, "And God will exalt you.。
God will lift you up. God will take。
care of you." Now I want to say something。
important here.。
Those are not expectations.。
They're explanations.。
Do you see what I'm saying?。
Because if you say, "Well I'm going to leave here and。
I'm going to be humble so that God can exalt me,"。
that's being prideful. It doesn't。
work that way. You say, "Hey,。
I'm going to leave here and I'm going to be humble because。
God is God.。
And I'm a servant."。
And then what he does。
as an explanation for that person。
who's truly humble, he lifts。
up, he exalts.。
So you don't be humble to be exalted.。
You be humble because。
you understand who God is.。
And so,。
we're dressing up in humility. Like I。
said, my friend literally plans out his。
day based on where he needs to wear。
humility. And to say something。
in a different way, it's Peter saying,。
"Hey, humility looks good on everyone."。
Okay? It's that little black dress you。
can wear to the funeral and the wedding。
and on the date. You know, humility is that。
button-down shirt that you told。
your friends is illegal in 48 states because you。
look so good in it. Like that is。
humility, right?。
So you wear that.。
You put it on just like。
that shirt.。
And I want you to know, and we'll。
wrap up with this idea,。
is that you're not the only one。
wearing this uniform.。
You're not the only。
one wearing this uniform. See, it says, "Resist。
him standing firm in the faith。
because you know that the family of believers throughout。
the world。
is undergoing the same kind of suffering."。
And this is an important。
aspect of humility.。
The humble, humble people。
know that they are tempted。
just like。
everyone else.。
All the other people who。
are wearing the same kind。
of uniform. And so, maybe。
you're sitting there and moments ago, you're like,。
"Man, how does he talk about。
pornography so freely? I can't even say the word."。
And like he just talks about,。
like, "Really? Gosh, that prayer was。
graphic. Wow."。
And here's how.。
Because I know you struggle just like I do.。
Guys and girls alike。
all over the planet Earth,。
we struggle in the same。
ways. And when you。
start saying, "No, no, no, no, no, no. You don't。
get it, man. You haven't been where I'm at.。
You haven't struggled with this kind of depression。
that I have or this anxiety。
it's unique to me." Or, "Hey, bro, what。
do you know about same-sex attraction?。
You haven't walked in my shoes. You don't know what it's like.。
What do you want to be? To be celibate my entire。
life?" You've taken a position of pride.。
Can I tell you something?。
See, what happens is when I get done preaching up here,。
as I stand up here, and then what happens is you guys。
come up and you want to chat. And then what happens。
is the same thing every。
single week is somebody comes。
up, they look over. And I don't mean, I'm not trying to。
be disrespectful in this. I'm just。
saying what happens. They look over their shoulders,。
"Hey, man, can I talk to you? Hey, you mind。
if we come over here?" I'm like, "No,。
you can talk to me right here. What's up? What's going on?"。
"Oh, man, I just like,。
you know, I struggle。
with same-sex attraction, bro. And just like。
there's no other Christians who。
do that. And I'm just by myself and I'm the only。
one." And then we pray and we talk。
and we pray and hopefully say something。
helpful. And then he leaves or she。
leaves and somebody else comes up. "Hey, man,。
mind if I talk to you over here?"。
"What's up? Talk to me right here."。
"Man, I just struggle with same-sex attraction.。
I'm the only one here." I'm like, "No, you're。
not. See that guy over there?"。
I don't do that.。
I don't do that. But it's。
every week. And listen, I。
picked on one thing. Let me go with another,。
okay? I picked on one story. Let me go with another.。
"Hey, my struggle。
is the same as yours."。
"What do you mean?"。
"Oh, pornography."。
"Yeah, do you mind? Can I talk。
to you?" "No, it's good. You're good.。
Talk to me right here. What's up?" "I want to help."。
"Man, I'm just really struggling with。
porn. How do you access pornography?"。
"I'm on my phone, bro.。
My phone." "Where's your。
phone right now?"。
"It's in my pocket."。
"You're not struggling.。
You're carrying the lion around with you。
in your pocket.。
You hadn't started。
struggling. You're just feeding.。
You're not fighting.。
What do you。
want me to do? Get rid of my phone?" "Sure."。
"Yes."。
End of word.。
"What am I supposed to have? A flip phone?"。
"Yeah, why not?。
Get you a flip phone.。
Get you a razor. Remember those things? They were cool.。
You know?。
Everybody had a razor.。
Get you a razor.。
You won't have to look at porn.。
Can't look at porn on a razor.。
It's all grainy.。
You know? That's not cool."。
Here's what I mean, okay?。
I think I ruffled some feathers。
on that last one, so let me just hear me out。
on this, okay? I know that Peter's。
writing to the persecuted church.。
He's writing at a time when Christians are。
literally fed to lions. I get that.。
And I think the way that。
the verse applies to。
the church today in a time of。
abundance where we can worship freely and。
raise our hands and bring our Bibles in public,。
it can apply to。
temptation in the same way that 1 Corinthians。
10:13 does. 1 Corinthians 10:13。
says this, "No temptation。
has seized you except what is。
common to mankind."。
And God is faithful.。
He will not allow you to be tempted。
beyond what you can bear.。
And when you are tempted, He will provide。
a way out so that you can stand up under it.。
Here's what He's saying. God will never。
put you in a cage with a lion and lock。
the door. If He ever puts you in a。
cage with a lion, He's going to give you a key.。
He's going to show you a way out.。
He's going to put a bright red exit。
sign up saying, "Hey, come this way.。
Don't jack with that lion. Don't feed。
that lion. You come with Me.。
I've got something。
better for you."。
And so your situation is not。
unique. You are tempted。
just like millions of other people are。
tempted. And you。
can stand firm in the same。
way that Jesus in the garden stood。
firm. Peter stood firm.。
The Apostle Paul stood firm.。
The saints that have gone before you。
for centuries and centuries。
and centuries have stood firm.。
You too can stand firm. You。
do not ever for the rest。
of your life have to sin.。
Ever. It will never happen.。
That you。
will always have a choice to make.。
I can feed my。
flesh. I can feed the。
lion. I can come in the。
opposition of God or I can。
humble myself and walk out the door.。
Get out of the。
cage.。
I can move on.。
I can choose something better.。
And you say,。
"Man,。
you don't understand.。
Life of celibacy,。
man, that's terrifying."。
It is for a little。
while. And then。
you go to heaven.。
And then it's not.。
And so。
you say, "What do I do?" Let me ask you this. Is there。
anything you could do today to pursue God more?。
Do that.。
Do that. And the God of all grace,。
verse 10, who called you to His eternal。
glory in Christ, "After you。
have suffered a little while, will Himself restore。
you and make you strong, firm。
and steadfast." You see, He says。
He'll make you strong, firm and steadfast. He will。
help you carry the chairs.。
He will help you carry the weight of life.。
You don't have to do it on your own.。
That when you humble yourself,。
God, the strongest。
being in the history of history, will。
come beside you and help。
you and make you strong, firm。
and steadfast. And then He ends in worship。
to Him be the power forever。
and ever. Amen. And I love。
that idea that earthly humility。
leads to eternal worship.。
See, you don't need to be king here.。
You need to know the king here.。
You can stop going through。
this life saying, "Hey, look at。
me and how many followers do I have?。
And how many likes did I get? And I want。
people to love me and to know me and to like me."。
You just go through life saying, "Hey, I know。
the king and I'm loved by him."。
And you're a road。
sign.。
You're a road sign pointing to King。
Jesus. That's your。
role. You know those guys。
that whenever。
there's a king, like in those movies where there's a bunch。
of guys carrying the throne, walking。
down the street, holding them up.。
You've seen that in a... That's your role.。
You carry the king's chair。
for the rest of your days.。
That's your role.。
Embrace that. Sometimes。
humility starts with just embracing。
obscurity. "I'm okay if I'm not。
known. I'll preach。
the gospel, die and be forgotten.。
I'm okay。
if you don't like me.。
I want to tell you the truth with grace.。
I want to point you to。
Jesus. I want。
to show you the way.。
You need to be okay if they don't like you.。
You need to be。
okay if you're alone like Noah。
building an ark like a crazy。
man. You just embrace obscurity.。
It's。
alright.。
You're going to die like everybody else has died.。
If you've trusted in Christ, you're going to go be with。
Him forever. Your。
obscurity down here won't matter。
there."。
Moving toward Christmas.。
When my son。
prays, the same little boy prays.。
He。
always says the。
same thing. He says, "God,。
thank you that we get presence。
on your birthday."。
I love the observation。
that he made himself.。
That God's a generous God and that。
on His birthday we get presence.。
It's the。
paradox of faith.。
That on His death we get life.。
That when。
He loses His life, we get eternal。
security. We get。
eternal life.。
That when He。
dies, our sins are。
forgiven. That when He。
endures the wrath of God, we get。
freedom from that.。
That at His funeral,。
we receive salvation.。
I think that。
God loves a humble heart because。
God has a humble heart.。
We see that。
humble heart just in the way that when He came。
here, He came here to serve us.。
Even with His life and even。
in His death, He came here。
to serve us.。
In summary, pride。
brings opposition.。
God helps the humble.。
I encourage you to wear。
humility.。
I don't know if you guys。
saw that Prince。
Harry is engaged. You guys see this?。
If you've。
been on a computer, you've seen that.。
Then。
there's the other。
guy. What's his name? Oh, yeah.。
William and。
Kate.。
They're pregnant.。
Do you see this? Having a royal baby,。
their third child.。
Just think about this for a minute. We'll wrap。
up here.。
Think about the care that that little。
baby's going to get. Royal child.。
Best。
doctors in the whole world. In the most。
amazing delivery room that your。
mind can possibly fathom.。
The softest sheets.。
The。
most incredible pajamas. Their。
pajamas cost more than my car.。
That little baby's pajamas.。
Everybody's going to be fighting.。
The media's going to be fighting over who can。
cover the。
birth of that child.。
Contrast。
that with the humility of God.。
That when。
God came here 2017。
years ago in an event that reset the calendar,。
He。
came to。
a town that you would have never heard of.。
It's like a。
suburb of Van.。
Like Lindale. That's where。
He came. Bethlehem. You would have。
never heard of Bethlehem except Jesus。
was born there.。
When He came,。
the God who created。
the entire world couldn't。
find a room to be。
born in. There was no。
room.。
He went in a cave. It was a cave.。
I've been in the cave.。
Supposedly the cave He was born in,。
I've been in it. It's where they kept。
animals.。
That when the King of kings and the。
Lord of lords was born here,。
the shouts of "It's a boy!" were。
covered with the sounds of animals.。
The delivery room was。
filled with the stench of animal。
feces. That was Him.。
Where they put Him, they didn't know where to put Him.。
So they set Him in a feeding trough.。
A place where literally donkeys。
and cows just had their noses to eat.。
They set Him down in there. The King。
of kings, the one who formed you in your。
mother's womb, the one who all。
things were created by Him and for Him.。
The supremacy belongs to。
Him. The fullness of the deity。
dwelled in Him. That God, here.。
Crying.。
And as soon as He was born,。
kings wanted to kill Him.。
This little baby caused such。
a commotion. And He would die.。
He would die. But only after。
He lived a perfect life. A life。
you can't live.。
And He died because you can't live it.。
He endured the wrath of God.。
The most innocent person that。
has ever been died for your。
pornography and for your materialism。
and for your identity struggles。
and for your identity and singleness。
or marriage or wanting。
things. Your covetousness.。
Your adultery. Your fornication.。
Your drunkenness.。
Went on Him.。
And so this Christmas,。
I want you。
to spend this season。
the way Peter ends in worship.。
I want you to worship Him.。
With your all. That's what we're。
going to do tonight. We're just going to end the year。
in worship. And I。
don't want prideful。
worship. I want you to。
get lost in worship. A humble。
worship. It's you and God. Just you and God.。
You sing to Him.。
Like you would as if you saw。
the Savior of the world。
in the manger.。
I want you to sing like that.。
Watch this with me.。
