(upbeat music)。
- Well, what's up Porch?。
How are we doing tonight?。
Hey, it's so good to see you.。
Welcome to the Porch.。
My name is Timothy Atik,。
and I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark。
on Sundays as well as here on Tuesday nights.。
I do wanna give a shout out。
to all of our Porch Live locations watching tonight.。
I'm looking at you Midland, Tulsa, Boise.。
I'm so glad that you're tuning in with us tonight.。
Would y'all say hello to my good friend, Jenny Allen,。
who's with us tonight.。
Hey, so here's the deal.。
If you are just jumping in for the first time in a while。
here at the Porch, we have been in a series。
on the topic of prayer.。
And the whole goal of the series has been。
to help us gain traction in talking to and hearing from God.。
And Jenny came and joined me。
on the first night of the series,。
and we, that was a voice crack.。
I just hit puberty yesterday.。
It's going super well so far.。
But on the first night of the series, four weeks ago,。
Jenny jumped in and we had a great conversation。
around prayer and it just felt right。
to bookend the series, having Jenny come back.。
If you haven't been tracking with us,。
Jenny, you wanna say hello?。
I'm just talking and you're there.。
- I'm good.。
It is so good to be here.。
Y'all, we're gonna cause trouble tonight.。
We don't totally have a plan for all of this.。
Can I just give a little hint?。
- Sure.。
- We're gonna pray tonight.。
(congregation cheering)。
Isn't that good?。
So creative.。
- Yeah, I mean, we were talking about it.。
It was like, okay, we'd been doing a series on prayer,。
but we haven't really prayed.。
So it felt right for us to,。
as we're doing a series on prayer,。
to actually pray together.。
So we're gonna do that in just a little bit.。
But before we do that,。
I felt like one of the best things I could do。
is take you to these couple verses in the Bible。
that I think will really set us up for tonight.。
So if you have a Bible,。
I want you to turn in your phones to Matthew 21.。
And I just wanna look at verses 12 and 13 very quickly,。
because it has everything to do。
with where we're going tonight.。
The fact that we are going to spend。
a little bit of time praying together,。
these couple verses will show us。
why we are going to do that.。
And it's a story in the Bible。
about Jesus cleaning out the temple.。
Here's what it says in Matthew 21, verses 12 and 13.。
It says this, "And Jesus entered the temple。
"and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple.。
"And he overturned the tables of the money changers。
"and the seats of those who sold pigeons.。
"He said to them, 'It is written,。
"'My house shall be called a house of prayer,。
"'but you make it a den of robbers.'"。
So here's why I wanted to start there, Jenny.。
I feel like it's a great place for us to start,。
because we wanna be people who value the presence of God.。
Like we wanna believe,。
and I know you believe this firmly in your life,。
that our God is a personal God,。
that he wants to meet with us.。
So when we step into this place at the porch,。
we believe God is here.。
He wants to meet with us.。
He wants to speak to us.。
In the temple, in the Bible,。
it was the place where God's presence dwelt.。
Like it was a very special place.。
The temple had a special room inside of it,。
known as the Holy of Holies,。
where the presence of God filled that one room.。
And only one person once a year。
was allowed to enter that room.。
And he would enter that room。
with a rope tied around his ankle。
in case he died when he was in there meeting with God.。
People could pull him out。
without having to go in after him.。
And so you have the temple,。
which is supposed to be the place。
where the presence of God resides,。
and the people of God are supposed to come。
and worship him and meet with him.。
But Jesus shows up, and what's going on?。
There's people who are selling animals in God's house.。
There's sheep and cows and pigeons。
roaming around God's house.。
And not only that,。
there's people inside of the temple。
who are exchanging money.。
Why is that happening?。
Well, people would come to the temple。
to offer sacrifices to God.。
So the reason that they're selling animals。
is because there are people from all over the Roman Empire。
who are coming to offer sacrifices to God.。
So they're doing people a favor。
so that they don't have to drag their sheep。
across the Roman Empire.。
They can just show up and buy one.。
And the reason that they're changing money。
is that there was a temple tax。
that every male over the age of 20 was supposed to pay,。
and there was only one currency that was accepted.。
But you had various currencies。
from around the Roman Empire that were coming.。
And so they offered that they would exchange money.。
The issue is not that animals were being sold。
or that money was being exchanged.。
What was the issue?。
The issue was where they were doing it.。
They were doing it inside of God's house,。
which was supposed to be the place。
where people met with God.。
Let me ask you,。
have you ever had your quiet time in Walmart。
on Good Friday?。
No?。
What about at a petting zoo?。
Have you ever taken your Bible。
and had a quiet time at a petting zoo。
or at the State Fair of Texas?。
Probably not.。
Why?。
'Cause that's not the most conducive environment。
to meet with God.。
The issue wasn't what they were doing.。
The issue is where they were doing it.。
One commentator said this,。
"Instead of solemn dignity in the murmur of prayer,。
there is the bellowing of cattle in the bleeding of sheep.。
Instead of brokenness and contrition,。
holy adoration and prolonged petition,。
there is noisy commerce."。
So here's the most fascinating thing,。
and this is why I bring this up。
just to frame what we're about to do.。
The crazy thing is that the presence of God。
had long departed from the temple,。
and it was just business as usual。
for the people who were supposed to be the people of God.。
Like they had lost all awareness of the presence of God.。
Instead of valuing presence,。
they valued convenience and attendance.。
We don't wanna be those people.。
We wanna be a people who values the presence of God.。
We wanna be people who show up tonight。
believing God is here, and he wants to meet with us.。
Jesus says, "My Father's house is a house of prayer."。
Jesus wanted the temple, the house of God,。
if it was known for one thing,。
Jesus wanted it to be known for prayer.。
Now, this is the final thing that I wanna,。
this is the final point that I wanna make.。
This is the most important part.。
Don't miss this.。
What's interesting is the temple。
that was the house of God where the presence of God。
was supposed to reside,。
listen to what Paul says in the book of 1 Corinthians.。
He says, "Do you not know that you,"。
and in the Greek, you is plural.。
So he's talking to the people of the church.。
He's saying, "Do you not know that you are God's temple。
"and that God's spirit dwells in you?"。
So here's what I need you to do.。
I need you to put Matthew 21。
and 1 Corinthians 3 together.。
1 Corinthians 3 says that you, in fact, now are the temple,。
that we, the people of God, the church,。
are the temple where God's presence resides.。
What does Matthew 21 say?。
It says God's house should be a house of prayer.。
The temple should be referred to as a house of prayer.。
It should be known for prayer.。
So if you pair that with 1 Corinthians chapter three,。
what do we find out? That we, the people of God,。
the temple of God now, should be known for prayer.。
So that's why we wanna be a people tonight。
who gather together and pray.。
- So I don't know how you're feeling when you hear that,。
that we're gonna pray tonight.。
Some of you, I imagine, are here and you aren't a believer。
and you haven't prayed ever or very often in your life.。
And I just wanna say, this is a really safe place。
to not know what you're doing,。
that you're not gonna experience any judgment。
or anything that should make you uncomfortable.。
This should feel easy.。
And if you just want to be quiet, it's okay.。
But I would say to those of you。
that don't yet know God or trust Christ,。
that talking to Him is an awesome thing to do.。
And asking Him, "Hey, if you're real,。
I would love to know you,"。
to talk to Him in a way that is honest and real.。
That is what we're going to do tonight.。
We're going to be honest and real.。
And so I actually wanna begin this night。
by you getting really comfortable.。
So if that means you spread out, get on the floor,。
whatever you need to do, just move around.。
I want you to get in a different location。
and posture than you're in now.。
So move around.。
Good luck.。
Spread out.。
Make a new friend.。
- Huh, yeah.。
(audience chattering)。
(audience laughing)。
(audience chattering)。
- All right.。
(audience laughing)。
Here's how we're gonna start.。
I want you to close your eyes.。
And we're just gonna be quiet for just a minute.。
I want you to close your eyes,。
and I want you to think about your feet on the ground。
or where you're sitting.。
I want you to think about your breath.。
I want you to remember that God is with you,。
but you are also with many people who love him.。
And I wanna begin with just as honest as you can be,。
you in the quietness of your heart,。
expressing to God how you're doing with him.。
What is your relationship like?。
I want you to be honest about it.。
I want you just to tell him.。
Likely, in the last 15 seconds,。
your attention was hard to focus.。
It was hard to focus on prayer.。
And I wanna tell you, do not judge that.。
Just every time that your attention wanders off,。
just gently bring it back.。
Now I want you to express to God。
what you want your relationship with him to be.。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
And I want you to ask him what he thinks about you.。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
(silence)。
What are some of the things that you've heard?。
You can yell them out.。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
(indistinct)。
So Father, we enter this night in the safety of your love for us.。
And we thank you that you have provided the means for us to be right with you.。
And wherever we are, we can come to you.。
We don't have to make everything right about us.。
We don't have to keep our attention perfectly focused on you.。
We don't have to even have nice things to say to you.。
We can just come to you.。
Thank you.。
Now we're gonna turn our eyes to God.。
And I want us to just thank him for who he is.。
That's how we're gonna begin.。
So we're gonna do that corporately because it's so special that we can。
and say these things out loud to God.。
So God, you are kind.。
I want you just to speak out and even wherever you are listening from,。
if you're in a location with other people,。
I think speak out the words to each other.。
And let's just pray and thank God for who he is.。

God, you are all of these things,。
all of the words that are being thought and said in the room.。
God, you are beyond these words,。
thousands of them being spoken at the same time.。
You are different than us.。
We can't imagine your holiness and your goodness and your kindness,。
and yet you set your eyes on us.。
Thank you.。
And we know because the scripture tells us that you care for us。
and that you want us to make our requests known to you.。
So God, would you bring to mind the things that we need,。
the things that the people we love need?。
And as God brings those things to your mind,。
I want you to share with two or three people around you,。
and then I want you to pray together over those things.。
And if that is not comfortable for you, it's okay.。
Just say, "I'd rather not pray out loud."。
But I would encourage you to pray together,。
two to three of you right now,。
for the things that are on your heart.。

- Well, Lord, you tell us to pray, "Give us this day our daily bread."。
And so that's what we're doing right now.。
We're just acknowledging what we need, and we are asking you to provide it, Lord.。
And so what a joy it is to be able to bear one another's burdens and to pray for one another now.。
And we thank you that you hear our prayers, and we thank you, God, that our lives are safe in your hands,。
that you know what we need.。
Just as you met the Israelites' needs every morning, that there was always man awaiting,。
we pray that you, God, would provide for whatever was just spoken in this place.。
I pray that you would provide it in your kindness and in your perfect way.。
In Jesus' name, amen.。
Here's what I want to do now.。
I just want to ask you guys to be honest as much as you're willing,。
but I would imagine that there are people in this room who would say, "Yeah, life is really tough right now."。
Maybe you feel like you're in the midst of a dark place or just in the midst of a trial,。
what you hoped your life would be right now and what it actually is are very, very far apart.。
So if you're going through a trial right now, if life is hard, if something is hurting,。
would you slip up your hand real quick so we know who that is?。
And here's what I want to ask you to do.。
I want to ask you to leave your hand up, and if you look around and you see someone with their hand up,。
if you're willing, would you just come around them and ask them their name?。
And what we want to do is we want to pray for them.。
And you can even take a moment and share if you feel comfortable and just say,。
"Would you pray for this? Would you pray for my mom who has cancer?。
Would you pray that I could find a job quickly?"。
Whatever it is, share that real quick.。
And then what I want to ask you guys to do is to pray out loud for one another.。
And if you're not around someone who has a hand lifted up, that's okay.。
Would you pray for them out loud?。
Would you pray for the people who are hurting in this room?。
Take a moment and do that.。

But if you're sitting there and you don't have someone to pray for,。
pray for the people who feel depressed right now or anxious.。
Pray for those who feel suicidal.。
Pray for those who have a loved one who is battling cancer.。
Pray for people who desperately need a job.。
Pray for those who have gone through a breakup and are dealing with a lot of heartache.。
Just pray for those who are dealing with hurt and pain right now.。

Psalm 40 says, "I waited patiently for the Lord.。
He inclined to me and heard my cry.。
He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog,。
and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.。
He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God.。
Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.。
Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust."。
Lord, I do pray for every person in this room who is hurting right now.。
I thank you that there is not one person in this room who has to hurt alone.。
Lord God, that you see into the darkest places of our lives.。
You know the thoughts that have been had in this room of taking their own lives.。
Lord, you know the people who have despaired, who feel lonely,。
who feel anxious or depressed.。
Lord, you know those who have lost a loved one.。
Lord, you know those who have parents who are going through a divorce right now.。
Those who are having to navigate all sorts of complexities。
in a friend's situation or something at work.。
Lord, I just thank you that you are a God who is near to the brokenhearted.。
God, I pray that you would put a new song in people's mouth.。
I pray that you would put people's feet on solid ground.。
For those who feel hopeless, I pray that even right now as I'm talking,。
they would sense you breathing hope into their souls.。
Lord, I thank you that you deeply love each one of us and that you're with us.。
David says, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,。
I will fear no evil for you are with me."。
Thank you that you are with us, even in the toughest moments of life.。
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.。
I want to take just a minute and make some observations of some things。
that are happening in the room.。
This isn't something we do all the time together.。
And one of the things that just happened is you were the priesthood of the believers.。
You owned your place.。
You believed that a pastor didn't have to pray for that person,。
that you could pray and pastor that person.。
And that is a weapon that God has given us into your hands.。
He has given you a weapon, and it is the weapon of prayer.。
And we don't believe how powerful it is because we don't believe how powerful our God is.。
We don't know that he really is listening.。
But whether you're in your workplace or on the side of the road。
or with a checkout person or with a waiter, you can pray for people.。
You can be this for people.。
Doesn't it feel powerful?。
All of you that just got prayed for, is that not the greatest gift?。
Such a gift, yes.。
And we get to go give that away anytime.。
So, we're going to move into a time of confession.。
You knew we were going to go there.。
If I didn't get excited, here's why.。
Because, T.A., there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.。
That is true.。
It is true.。
And if it is true, then this is the safest place in the world to say your sin.。
But before we get to that, I actually want to help your view of confession with God to grow a little greater.。
Confession means to say what is true.。
And sometimes what is true is that you're struggling with addiction.。
Sometimes what is true is that you're struggling with sin.。
Sometimes what is true is you're struggling with immorality in a relationship.。
But sometimes what is true is you are paralyzed in fear.。
And so, I want to begin this little part of confession, I want to begin by praying against fear.。
And by naming your fears.。
Each of you is probably afraid of something.。
It may not be obvious to you every day, but it's probably the thing beneath the thing.。
It's something that you're afraid of.。
And so, I want to take just a minute, and I want you to process that with the people you've been praying with.。
And 2 Timothy 1:7 says this, "For God gave us a spirit, not of fear, but of power, of love, and self-control."。
So, if we're going to fight sin, then we have to not be afraid.。
And so, what is it that you're afraid of?。
Of course, the thing that the enemy has made you believe is more powerful than God.。
So, with your people right now, I want you to just confess your fear.。

[inaudible]。
[inaudible]。
[inaudible]。
[inaudible]。
Okay.。
I know, y'all are just getting started.。
But I'm not going to miss sin, too, so we're going there.。
And here's how I want to do this.。
So, you've said your fear. Many of you haven't had a chance to pray for it yet.。
And here's how we're going to do confession.。
We're going to say it out loud.。
"God, forgive me for blank."。
"God, release me from blank."。
Whatever that fear is, say what is true.。
And we're just going to spend some time in the quiet.。
And you can stand up and say it loud, or you can stand up and say it quiet.。
I don't care, but I want you to stand up, because there is something powerful about standing up and speaking it.。
[silence]。
Alright. Calm down, folks.。
Let's go.。
[silence]。
[inaudible]。
[inaudible]。
How do you work with existence?。
[inaudible]。
[inaudible]。
[inaudible]。
[inaudible]。
[inaudible]。
[inaudible]。
[inaudible]。
[inaudible]。
[inaudible]。
You promise, God,。
if we confess our sins to you,。
that you will forgive us our sins.。
And so we believe that.。
And we pray against the enemy who condemns.。
We pray against the enemy who lies.。
We pray against the enemy who issues a spirit of fear.。
God, we want you.。
We want a night like tonight to be our everyday life.。
Praying with our friends and running after you and fighting the darkness.。
God, we don't want to exist for our few days here.。
We want to be in the river of your spirit.。
We want to not miss every good work that you have prepared in advance for us to do.。
So, God, would we not bow down to the lies?。
Would we not bow down to the condemnation?。
But would you be the lifter of our heads?。
Would you lift our heads and remind us what is true?。
You have us.。
You love us.。
You like us.。
And we can come to you with anything and everything.。
Every word that was spoken,。
God, in confession, quiet or loud.。
God, I pray that you would bring comfort and peace.。
I pray that there would be no shame,。
that there would be no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.。
And for those who have not yet met Christ Jesus,。
would this be the moment?。
Would this be the moment where they realize。
a broken people can come to God in their brokenness?。
God, I pray for the person right now。
that knows that they don't know you.。
God, I pray that this would be the minute。
that they would just simply pray these words,。
because this is all we do,。
is to put our faith and hope in you.。
Jesus, I need you.。
I believe that you are the son of God.。
I believe that these sins that I've been so afraid。
to say out loud, God, that you knew them already.。
And that you have the power to forgive them。
because of the blood of Jesus.。
So would you come into my life and I will serve you.。
I will follow you.。
Help me do that.。
And our God who conquered death。
has the power for sure to conquer sin.。
Yes, it is good.。
It is good.。
(congregation applauding)。
And so we're gonna pray for the world。
and for the people that don't know him yet.。
- Yeah.。
So the last thing we wanna pray is,。
I wanna invite you to just think about the people。
in your spheres of influence。
who do not have a relationship with Jesus Christ.。
They might be here with you tonight.。
I was thinking about a woman in scripture, Lydia,。
and here's what it says about her.。
It says, "The Lord opened her heart。
"to pay attention to what was said by Paul."。
And so I just want you to think,。
is there someone in your life,。
maybe it's a family member, maybe it's a friend,。
maybe it's a co-worker,。
maybe it's someone that you work out with。
or someone that you live next to in your apartment complex,。
and something in your heart is burdened。
for them to know Jesus Christ.。
And it is your deep desire for God to do in their life。
what he did with Lydia,。
that he would open their heart。
to pay attention to the good news that Jenny just shared,。
that Jesus Christ died.。
Why did he die?。
Because we needed a savior,。
that every single one of us is sinful,。
that we've all turned and gone our own way,。
that no one has lived the life that God has required,。
and because of that, we all deserve punishment,。
separation from God.。
And yet Jesus Christ died in our place.。
He was punished so that we wouldn't have to be.。
He rose from the dead as a display。
that his payment for our sin was enough.。
So if there's someone in your life that you want that for,。
would you just take a moment and would you pray that?。
You can pray out loud, you can call their name out.。
If they're with you right now, maybe you don't call it out.。
But let's take a moment,。
and I want to invite you to pray specifically。
that God would open up specific people's hearts to the gospel.。
Take a moment, pray out loud for them.。
(gentle music)。
(people whispering)。
(gentle music)。

(people whispering)。
(gentle music)。
(people whispering)。
(gentle music)。
(people whispering)。
(gentle music)。
(people whispering)。
(gentle music)。
(people whispering)。
And as you continue to pray,。
I want you to pray for those around the world。
who have never heard the name of Jesus.。
I think about what Revelation chapter seven says.。
It paints the picture of a day.。
It says this, "After this I looked and behold。
"a great multitude that no one could number。
"from every nation, from all tribes and peoples。
"and languages, standing before the throne。
"and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes,。
"with palm branches in their hands,。
"and crying out with a loud voice,。
"'Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne。
"'and to the Lamb.'"。
And so I want to ask you guys to pray for that.。
Beg God to raise up people to go to those in the world。
who have never heard the name of Jesus.。
Maybe that's you.。
Maybe that is you sitting here in this room。
and something in your heart right now is on fire saying,。
"I'll take the gospel to those who have never heard of Jesus."。
But let's pray right now.。
Pray that God would raise people up and send them out.。
Pray that God would reveal himself。
in miraculous ways tonight in various people groups,。
that there would be revival all around the world.。
Pray for that right now.。

And as you continue to pray, I'm going to read you a prayer。
that the apostles prayed in the book of Acts。
when they were enduring persecution for sharing the gospel.。
Here's what was prayed.。
"And now, Lord, look upon their threats。
and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word。
with all boldness while you stretch out your hand to heal,。
and signs and wonders are performed。
through the name of your holy servant Jesus."。
It says, "And when they had prayed, the place。
in which they were gathered together was shaken,。
and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit。
and continued to speak the word of God with boldness."。
And so, God, my prayer is right now in this place, God.。
You would fill each person who knows you,。
who calls you Savior and Lord.。
I pray that you would fill them with your spirit.。
And I pray that this would be a generation of young adults。
that are filled with boldness, God, that tomorrow,。
when they wake up and they go to their work,。
may they see their workplaces as mission fields,。
as places with people who desperately need to hear the gospel.。
I pray that tomorrow there would be hundreds,。
if not thousands of conversations that are happening。
across the city of Dallas where the name of Jesus。
is being proclaimed, the gospel is being shared.。
And I pray that tomorrow or even tonight。
would be the day of salvation for someone,。
that the gospel would be shared and someone would put their trust in you.。
I thank you, God, for what you're doing in this place.。
I thank you for every individual here.。
I pray that when they leave in just a few minutes,。
God, they would know that you are leaving with them,。
and they can continue the conversation with you。
as they get in the car.。
Lord, I pray that as we seek you in prayer, we would find you.。
And I pray that this summer we would have our best summer yet with you,。
because as we draw near to you, you would draw near to us.。
May we be a people who know the joy of your presence。
and the pleasures forevermore that exist in you, Lord Jesus.。
We need you, we love you, and we sing to you in Jesus' name.。
Amen.。
